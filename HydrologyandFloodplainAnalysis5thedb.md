> available (McCuen, 1982; Viessman and Lewis, 1996). The newest

> WinTR-55, which, along with other useful hydro- logic software, may be
> downloaded from the NRCS; search for "NRCS WinTR-55." The strength of
> the NRCS method is the experience of four decades of model development
> and use and the enormous database of soils information; highly
> site-specific data can be obtained from county soils maps and NRCS
> Soil Survey Interpretation Sheets. (These data are also very use- ful
> in applications using methods other than the SCS method.) The weakness
> of the NRCS method is its synthetic design storm philosophy, which was
> critiqued in Section 6.3. With this method, it is also difficult to
> duplicate measured hydrographs in areas with high water tables. This
> difficulty arises from the SCS method's sensitivity to the depth of
> the water table and its inability to represent this factor using the
> three available antecedent condi- tions (Capece et al., 1984).

> **SWMM**
>
> The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was developed for the
> Environmental Protection Agency in 1969--1971 as a single-event model
> for simulation of quantity and quality processes in combined sewer
> systems (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971; Huber et al., 2005). It has
> since been applied to virtually every aspect of urban drainage, from
> routine drainage design to sophisticated hydraulic analysis to
> nonpoint-source runoff quality studies, using both single-event and
> continuous simulation. By subdividing large catchments and routing
> flows down the drainage system, SWMM can be applied to catchments of
> almost any size, from parking lots to subdivisions to cities. An
> extensive literature exists for SWMM, exemplified in proceed- ings of
> the type edited by James et al. (2006).
>
> Although Version 4 of SWMM (Huber and Dickinson, 1988; Roesner et al.,
> 1988) is still useful for some purposes, most SWMM users will be best
> served by Version 5: SWMM5, released in 2004. This version has been
> care- fully recoded in the C language to eliminate errors and add
> features, and it
>
> includes a GUI. The model, code, and documentation (Rossman, 2005) may
> be freely downloaded at <http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/>
> swmm/. Notable in the documentation is an applications manual (Gironás
> et al., 2009).
>
> Runoff is generated from rainfall in SWMM using a nonlinear reservoir
> method (Example 6--9). Subsurface flow routing of water infiltrated
> through the soil surface is optional. Flow routing may be performed by
> the kinematic wave method or by using the complete Saint Venant
> equations. This dynamic wave routing remains one of the most powerful
> features of SWMM. Simula- tion of storage and hydraulic controls may
> be performed throughout the catch- ment and drainage systems. Water
> quality generation and transport may also be simulated throughout the
> catchment and drainage systems, as well as treat- ment in storage
> devices and elsewhere for modeling of most best management practices
> (BMPs). SWMM5 includes many graphical and other reporting tools. For
> instance, the statistics tool may be used to separate continuous
> simulation hydrographs and pollutographs (concentration vs. time) into
> independent storm events (as in Example 6--3), calculate statistical
> moments, and perform elementary frequency analyses. Metric units are
> optional. A detailed case study of the use of SWMM5 is given later in
> this chapter.
>
> **U.S. Geological Survey Models**
>
> The USGS is the leading federal agency for research in hydrology and
> has produced several rainfall--runoff models and flow routing software
> (e.g., the FEQ model described earlier), all of which are freely
> available from the USGS website:
> [http://water.usgs.gov/software/surface_water.html.](http://water.usgs.gov/software/surface_water.html)
> However, support for USGS surface water simulation tools is not as
> readily available as for the models previously described. In addition
> to simulation models, a large number of software packages for
> statistical analysis, sediment trans- port, scour analysis, and other
> hydrologic and hydraulic computations are also available from their
> generous website.
>
> **Model Selection**
>
> Although there may be theoretical reasons for preference of one model
> over another, the choice is often made on much more pragmatic grounds.
> Con- siderations include designation of a required model by a
> permitting agency, model support and documentation, familiarity with
> techniques used in a model, type of computer required, and
> availability of data. The last factor is probably the most important.
> For example, complex flow routing in a sewer cannot be performed
> without detailed information on invert elevations, ground surface
> elevations, and hydraulic structures in the sewer system. If such
> information is not available, a lumped parameter approach using a much
> simpler method (such as a UH) might be appropriate.
>
> When both rainfall and runoff data are available for calibration, most
> of the models discussed in this section can be calibrated for the
> catchment
>
> under consideration. In general, the simplest model that is applicable
> to the problems under study and that can be properly calibrated is
> probably the best choice. However, simple models are generally able to
> address fewer hypothetical "what-if" questions dealing with
> alternative design formula- tions, because the required physically
> based procedures may not be incor- porated into the models. Hence
> model choice is an important function of model capability as well as
> model simplicity.
>
> A sensitivity analysis of a model will reveal information on the
> relative importance of the many input parameters as well as
> uncertainty in model output (James and Kuch, 1998). This is an
> important introductory step for the use of any model.
>
> Finally, model reviews and comparative studies referenced earlier in
> this section may be consulted for guidance. Since model capabilities
> continu- ally change and improve, caution should be exercised when
> reading about models in older references and in this text. World Wide
> Web sites for all models are the best way to survey current model
> capabilities and availability.

> **Introduction**
>
> How may an urban rainfall--runoff model be applied to a real
> catchment? What kind of information results, and for what purpose? To
> illustrate the use of such a model, the calibration and verification
> of the SWMM5 model on a high-density residential (apartment)
> catchment, abbreviated HDR, in Miami, Florida, will be shown. Results
> of continuous simulations will be illustrated for purposes of
> frequency analysis and selection of design storms from the historic
> record. This particular catchment is one of four south Flor- ida
> catchments monitored by the USGS (Mattraw et al., 1978; Hardee et al.,
> 1978; Miller et al., 1979; Hardee et al., 1979), which collectively
> form one of the best model-testing opportunities of any extant
> dataset. The usefulness of the measured rainfall, runoff, and quality
> data is tremendously enhanced by the foresight of Miller (1979) in
> providing data needed for modeling for each of the four catchments.
>
> **The Catchment**
>
> The 14.7-ac HDR Catchment (Fig. 6--12) discharges to Snapper Creek
> (South Florida Water Management District Canal C-2) in south Miami,
> just southwest of the interchange of state highways 826 and 878. A
> watershed map used in SWMM5 is shown in Figure 6--12. Hardee et al.
> (1979) moni- tored 16 storms for rainfall, runoff, and water quality
> between May 1977 and June 1978. The apartment complex in 2011 is
> essentially the same as it was during the monitoring period, although
> cultural changes over 30 years would be expected to change runoff
> quality characteristics. The HDR catchment

> Cunning- ham and Huber (1987), Huber et al. (1991), Hamid (1995), and
> Lee and Heaney (2005). Catchment characteristics compiled by Miller
> (1979) are listed in Table 6--6, along with SWMM5 roughness,
> depression storage, and infiltration parameters and their basis.
>
> **Data Input and SWMM Calibration**
>
> Rainfall is converted into runoff in SWMM5 by the nonlinear reservoir
> method illustrated in Example 6--9; corresponding subcatchment input
> parameters are listed in Table 6--7, in addition to the global
> roughness, depression storage, and infiltration parameters listed in
> Table 6--6. The aver- age subcatchment slope could be found by
> selecting several points at the edge of the subcatchment, calculating
> the path length of each point to the subcatchment outlet, dividing the
> path lengths by the change in elevation, and taking an area-weighted
> average of the eight slopes. In this case, average slope was computed
> using an Arc/Info utility TIN (triangular irregular net- work) applied
> to a digitized map of the basin (Huber et al., 1991; see also Chapter
> 10). Percent imperviousness is DCIA (pavement, sidewalks) from
> Miller's (1979) data. An additional SWMM5 option would be to enter
> total imperviousness and then route the non-directly connected
> impervious runoff ("runon") over the adjacent pervious area (the
> remaining DCIA would drain directly to the subcatchment outlet). This
> refinement was not used for this example but would be especially
> useful in situations for which saturation of the pervious area is
> likely due to runon.

> Subcatchment width is a shape parameter, often used for calibration of
> peak flows. It can be estimated by determining the "average maximum"
> flow path length to the outlet, and dividing the area by this path
> length. The "average maximum" is the average of several flow path
> lengths from the outlet to the subcatchment boundary. This is the
> method used by Huber et al. (1991) to estimate widths for the HDR
> subcatchments. However, as per- haps more of an ambiguous input
> parameter than slope or roughness (nei- ther of which is necessarily
> straightforward to estimate), width is often used as the calibration
> parameter of choice for peak flows, since from Equation (6--20) it can
> be seen than any two of the three (width, slope, roughness) may be
> fixed and the third varied for calibration. Higher width usually means
> higher hydrograph peaks, because water runs off the subcatchment
> faster. However, in this modeling example, a priori input parameter
> estimates were sufficient to produce good calibration and verification
> simulations, and parameters were not varied beyond what is shown in
> Tables 6--6 and 6--7.

    respond to inten- sities less than 0.4 in./hr, as may be seen from

> Unfortunately, USGS regional flood frequency techniques (Chapter 3)
> cannot be applied to this small urban catchment in Miami because, as
> of 2011, no generalized equations are available for either the rural
> or urban areas of South Florida
> ([http://water.usgs.gov/software/nff.html).](http://water.usgs.gov/software/nff.html))
> However, the 5-yr rational method peak can be compared to the historic
> storms, and this section also serves to provide an additional rational
> method example. Chin (2004) provides a functional form of the IDF
> curves used in the Miami-Dade area:

where

> *i* = [308.5]{.underline} , (6--25) 48.6*T* ^-0.11^ + *t*(0.5895 + *T*
> ^-0.67^)

*i* = intensity (in./hr),

> *T* = return period (year), and
>
> *t* = rainfall duration (min).
>
> Interestingly, for a fixed *T*, Equation (6--25) is of the same form
> as Equation (6--10). The kinematic wave overland flow travel time
> \[Eq. (4--60)\] will be
>
> used in conjunction with assumed dynamic wave \[Eq. (6--7)\] travel
> times down the circular pipes shown in Figure 6--12. The longest
> travel time probably oc- curs from the combination of overland flow
> down subcatchments 207 and 208 toward inlets 7 and 8, plus the travel
> time down the four pipes from junction 8 to junction 1, neglecting the
> travel time down the outfall pipe, since that pipe typically has some
> standing water in it. From the SWMM5 input data, the four pipes
> connecting junctions 1 and 8 total 410 ft and all but one are 3 ft in
> diameter. The upper three pipes are corrugated metal pipe (CMP), with
> a Manning roughness of about 0.022 (Table 7--1), while the pipe
> connecting junctions 5 and 1 is reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), with a
> Manning roughness of about 0.013. Because the computations that follow
> are insensitive to most of the numbers used for the wave speed
> calculation, a simple average of 0.017 will be used for *n* instead of
> computation of a length-weighted harmonic mean or computation of wave
> speeds down the individual pipe segments. Invert elevations at
> junctions 8 and 1 are 2.262 and - 0.889 ft NGVD, respectively, giving
> an average slope of 0.00769. Assuming a 3-ft diameter pipe half full,
> Equation (6--7) gives a wave velocity of 6.16 ft/s and a corresponding
> dynamic wave travel time down the four pipes of 54 s ≈ 1 min.
>
> The dynamic wave travel time through the sewers will be added to the
> kinematic wave overland flow travel time. The latter is computed using
> an overland flow length of 500 ft (estimate for subcatchments 207 and
> 208 from Fig. 6--12), Manning roughness of 0.014 for the pavement
> (Table 6--6), and slope = 0.019 (SWMM input parameters for
> subcatchments 207 and 208). Iterations proceed as in Example 6--6,

> **Case Study Summary**
>
> The SWMM5 model was calibrated and verified for a high-density
> residen- tial apartment complex in Miami. Based on a continuous
> simulation, his- torical storm events were selected for prediction of
> peak flows and runoff volumes at desired return periods. A comparison
> was made with the 5-yr rational method peak, for which the results are
> highly sensitive to the choice of the runoff coefficient, *C*, but for
> which the rational method *Q*~peak~ was within the range of continuous
> simulation results using *C* = 0.5. The pri- mary advantage of the
> rational method and synthetic design storms is sim- plicity and ease
> of standardization by an agency. Advantages of continuous simulation
> using historical storms (Linsley and Crawford, 1974) include the
> following:

1.  Simulation using historical storms implies a frequency analysis of
    peak flows (or runoff volumes), not a conditional frequency analysis
    of rainfall depths. That is, the frequency analysis is on the
    parameter of interest.

2.  The frequency analysis of the continuous time series of flows
    includes all effects of antecedent conditions, whereas analysis of
    the synthetic design storms does not.

3.  The historical storms avoid the vexing questions of storm duration,
    shape, and hyetograph discretization. The duration is especially
    critical, since peak flows may arise out of a storm that lasts a few
    or several hours. There is simply no basis for establishing a
    standard duration, such as 24 hr, for all design work, as seems to
    be the unfor- tunate tendency in many urban areas.

4.  Historical storms can also be used for analysis of volumes for
    > design of basins for detention or retention. The volume of
    > synthetic storms is arbitrarily linked to the assumed rainfall
    > duration. A given volume can result from infinitely many
    > combinations of intensity and dura- tion, with a corresponding
    > range of return periods.

5.  If historical storms, rather than "unreal" synthetic storms, are
    > used for design, local citizens can be confident that the design
    > will withstand a real storm that they may remember for its
    > flooding. Thus, the engineers or agency can make a statement such
    > as, "Our design will avoid the flooding that resulted from the
    > storm of August 20, 1972."

6.  BMP design may be performed with more accurate knowledge of the
    > relationship between the magnitude of inflow rate or device volume
    > and the percentage of annual runoff volume controlled by the BMP.

> **SUMMARY**
>
> A wealth of analytical options exists for application to quantity
> problems in urban hydrology. These range from the simple calculations
> of the rational method (properly applied) to sophisticated computer
> models. However, only the latter option permits the use of continuous
> simulation, which avoids knotty problems of antecedent con- ditions
> and assignment of frequency to hydrographs that are inherent in the
> use of IDF curves and synthetic design storms. Regardless of whether
> an operational model is used for analysis of urban runoff, the same
> hydrologic tasks as in nonurban areas must be performed. These tasks
> include collection and analysis of rainfall data, com- putation of
> losses, conversion of rainfall excess to runoff by any of several
> methods, and flow routing down the drainage system. Although many of
> the analytical meth- ods that are applied to nonurban areas may also
> be applied to computation of urban runoff, urban areas present special
> problems associated with high imperviousness, fast response times, and
> complex hydraulic phenomena in the sewer system. New methods and
> models are continually revealed; the readers should maintain contact
> with the hydrologic literature to stay abreast of new developments in
> a field subject to rapid change.

> **PROBLEMS**

1.  Land use and population density data are given for several cities in
    the accompanying table. Estimate the percent imperviousness for each
    city us- ing two methods: (1) imperviousness as a function of
    population density and (2) weighted imperviousness as a function of
    land use. Assume that undeveloped land is the same as "open" in
    Table 6--2, and "other" is 50% institutional and 50% open. (Data
    sources: Heaney et al., 1977; Sullivan et al., 1978.)

2.  A small, 2-ha, mostly impervious urban catchment has an average
    slope of 1.5% and the following average Horton infiltration
    parameters: *f*~0~ = 4 mm/hr, *f~c~* = 1 mm/hr, *k* = 2.2 hr^-1^
    (infiltration occurs through cracks in the paving). Consider the
    rainfall hyetograph in Figure P6--2.

    a.  Determine the depression storage using Figure 6--3.

    b.  Determine the time of beginning of runoff.

    c.  Calculate and sketch the hyetograph of rainfall excess. Use the
        same time intervals as for the rainfall hyetograph, and average
        the first nonzero rain- fall excess over the whole time
        interval.

    d.  Determine the runoff coefficient.

    e.  Compute the volume of runoff, in m^3^.

9.  The subdivision of Problem 6.8 drains to the upstream end of a
    circular pipe that has an *n* value of 0.013 and a slope of 0.006
    ft/ft. Determine the size of pipe needed to carry the flow from the
    5-yr storm. (*Note:* Standard diameters in the United States start
    at 12 in. and increase in 6-in. increments to 60 in., then continue
    to increase in 12-in. increments.)

10. A 14.7-ac multifamily residential catchment in Miami has a total
    impervious area of 10.4 ac, but it has a hydraulically effective
    impervious area of only 6.48 ac. The pervious portions of the basin
    consist of lawns over a Perrine marl, with a very slow infiltration
    rate. Rainfall and runoff data monitored by the USGS (Hardee et
    al., 1979) are reported in Table 6--9 for 16 storm events.

    a.  Determine a linear relationship between runoff and rainfall
        > using linear regression analysis (least squares). Test the
        > significance of the regression, and plot the data points and
        > the fitted line.

    b.  What is the value of depression storage for this basin?

11. Using the data of Problem 6.10, determine the average runoff
    coefficient by

    a.  computing the runoff coefficient for each storm and finding the
        average;

    b.  dividing the total runoff for all storms by the total rainfall
        for all storms;

    c.  finding the slope of a runoff-vs.-rainfall regression line that
        > is "forced" through the origin.

> Discuss the computed runoff coefficients in relation to the values of
> impervi- ousness and hydraulically effective imperviousness.

12. A detention pond has the shape of an inverted truncated pyramid,
    > shown in Figure P6--12(a). It has a rectangular bottom of
    > dimension 120 \* 80 ft, a maxi- mum depth of 5 ft, and uniform
    > side slopes of 3:1 (horizontal:vertical). Hence the dimensions at
    > 5-ft depth are also rectangular, with length 150 ft and width 110
    > ft. The outlet from the basin behaves as an orifice, with a
    > diameter of 1 ft and a discharge coefficient of 0.9. The opening
    > of the orifice (a pipe draining from the center of the basin) is
    > effectively at a depth of zero (i.e., at the bottom of the pond).
    > (The pond floor would typically slope toward the outlet, but this
    > slope will be ignored in this problem. In addition, the orifice
    > will be assumed to follow its theoretical behavior even at very
    > small depths.)

    a.  What is the total volume of the pond, in ft^3^ and ac-ft?

    b.  Develop the depth-vs.-surface-area and depth-vs.-volume curves
        > for the pond. Use 1-ft intervals. Tabulate and plot.

13. Use the USGS regression equation \[Eq. (3--82)\] to compute the 5-yr
    peak flow for a 4-ac Tallahassee catchment that is 95% impervious.
    Compare your answer with the value computed in Example 6--6. The
    reason for the large discrepancy is that the regression equations
    were developed for much larger catchments (the smallest being 0.21
    mi^2^) and probably do not apply to a 4-ac catchment.

    1.  A 9.6-acre low-density residential site in Anchorage, Alaska,
        was monitored by the USGS during a study of the hydrology and
        water quality characteristics of the area (Brabets, 1987). Data
        for rainfall depth, runoff depth, and suspended solids, SS (in
        units of lb and lb/ac-in.) are given in the table. These data
        are for discrete rainfall events. Note that pounds per acre-inch
        has units of mass/ volume and is a concentration, whereas pounds
        of SS are a load (mass) and calculated by multiplying
        concentration *x* volume of runoff. (Appropriate con- version
        factors are included, of course.)

a.  Demonstrate the units conversion computation for the first row in
    > the table (i.e., that 53.8 lb/ac-in. with a runoff of 0.024 in.
    > results in 12.4 lb of SS).

b.  Rainfall is to be considered as an explanatory variable (independent
    > vari- able) for the prediction of runoff, SS (lb), and SS
    > (lb/ac-in.). Perform the three indicated linear regressions. Test
    > the significance of the regressions at the 95% level (alpha = 5%).
    > Plot the data points for runoff vs. rainfall on one graph and for
    > both SS values vs. rainfall on one or two other graphs. If the
    > regression is significant, include the predicted straight line.

> Although your software may test the significance automatically, list
> the "table" *T*-value that must be exceeded for the regression to be

c.  What other causative factors (that would vary with each storm) might
    > be included in a multiple linear regression of runoff vs. rainfall
    > (depths)?

3.  A planned subdivision near Tallahassee can be represented
    > conceptually as shown in Figure P6--20.

> The inner rectangle represents DCIA, consisting of rooftops, streets,
> side- walks, driveways, and so on. The dimensions of the inner
> rectangle are 1000 ft wide by 2500 ft tall. The pervious area behaves
> like "lawns, sandy soil, average

> slope." The DCIA has characteristics of streets and roofs. "High-end"
> values of runoff coefficients should be used.
>
> The inlet time for flow from the far upper end of the catchment (e.g.,
> an upper corner of the pervious area) is 2 hr. The inlet time just for
> the DCIA is 20 min.

(a) What is the 25-yr outflow, by the rational method? Remember to
    > compute runoff both for the total area and for just the DCIA.

(b) Use the USGS regression equations for Tallahassee \[Eq. (3--82)\]
    > and com- pute the 25-yr peak flow. Observe that this value is
    > close to the rational method estimate for DCIA, from part (a).

(c) A corrugated metal pipe (CMP) culvert (*n* = 0.024) will receive the
    > 25-yr flow from the catchment, using the rational method of part
    > (a). If the pipe slope is 1%, what standard U.S. diameter (see
    > Problem 6.9) should be used?

    1.  A subdivision in Corvallis, Oregon, is shown in Figure P6--21.
        Rational method design is performed using the 10-yr return
        period IDF curve of the Oregon Department of
        Transportation (2005) for Zone 8, which may be approximated as
        follows:

> *i* = 0.2081 + [29.8438]{.underline} - [184.51]{.underline} +
> [432.8875]{.underline},

*r r r*

> with *i* in in./hr and *t~r~* in minutes. The standard error of
> estimate is 0.0079 in./hr.

a.  Estimate the peak flow at the outlet from the "curved end portion"
    > of Sitka Place, roughly where a line on the asphalt pavement would
    > connect houses 3 and 8, as shown by the arrow on the figure.
    > Follow these steps and guidelines:

    -   You must construct an estimate of the tributary area.

    -   The impervious areas of houses 4, 5, 6, and 7 contribute runoff
        > to flow at the upper end of the street, but none of the other
        > houses do. Thus,

> ![](./images/media/image5.png)**Figure P6--21**
>
> Subdivision for Problem 6.21, with 10-ft contours. All impervious area
> is directly connected to the drainage system. To set a scale, the
> distance between the upper left corner of house 4 and lower right
> corner of house 10 is 381 ft. The outside dimensions of the whole
> figure are approximately 708 ft by 1104 ft.
>
> you can assume that the downhill edges of houses 4 and 7 and the
> downstream edge of their driveways define the lower boundary of the
> basin (apart from the pavement of the cul-de-sac).

-   Work uphill from these lower boundaries toward the high point on the
    > hill to define the tributary area, keeping in mind that the
    > boundary

> should be perpendicular to the contours. This will define a
> "teardrop"- shaped catchment.

-   Estimate the area using a planimeter or by counting squares.
    > Estimate an average slope by dividing the difference in upper and
    > lower eleva- tions by an estimated path length.

-   The undeveloped area above the end of the street behaves like a lawn
    > on "heavy soil." Overland flow roughness for this surface could be
    > char- acterized as for "dense shrubbery and forest litter."

-   Use the kinematic wave method to estimate *t~c~* and hence the peak
    > flow. Assume that the travel time over the impervious area is much
    > less than the travel time over the pervious area. Thus, base
    > kinematic wave pa- rameter a only on the pervious area
    > characteristics. Do not compute a weighted Manning's roughness.

-   The limit for the intensity-vs.-duration equation is 3 ... *t~r~*
    > ... 400 min- utes. Stop computation at 3 minutes if indicated.

b.  All the impervious area (rooftops, driveways, streets) is directly
    > con- nected. Hence, compute a second estimate of peak flow based
    > only on the DCIA. Which estimate governs?

c.  The AutoCAD map of Figure P6--21 was prepared in 1991. But in the
    > year 2007, the hill above Sitka Place was completely developed
    > with new houses! What does this imply about hydrologic design for
    > areas such as this?

2.  The Santa Barbara Urban Hydrograph Method (SBUHM) consists of two
    basic computational steps:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(1) Compute rainfall excesses for each rainfall time step. Rainfall
    > excesses (depth/time) from the pervious and impervious areas are
    > multiplied by their respective areas and summed to obtain one flow
    > value per time step for the entire catchment (the "instantaneous
    > hydrograph"). Any conven- ient means may be used to compute
    > rainfall excess, ranging from very simple runoff coefficients with
    > depression storage \[Eq. (6--11)\], to SCS curve numbers (Chapter
    > 2), to the infiltration equations of Chapter 2. In this method,
    > DCIA is often assumed to have no losses.

(2) The resulting instantaneous hydrograph is then routed through an
    > imagi- nary linear reservoir to provide delay and attenuation. The
    > linear reservoir has a time constant *K* = *t~c~* for the
    > catchment. Routing is performed using

> the Muskingum method equations (Section 4.2), with Muskingum param-
> eter *x* = 0 (for a linear reservoir) and Δ*t* = time step of
> instantaneous hydrograph.
>
> Use the data from Problem 6.15 to perform SBUHM routing. Assume that
> the rainfall excess applies to the entire catchment area (so for this
> problem, there is no merging of runoff from pervious area and DCIA).

a.  Compute the instantaneous hydrograph at 30-min intervals, in units
    > of cfs ≈ ac@in./hr.

b.  Inferring a value for the time of concentration for the overall
    > catchment from the given time--area data, compute Muskingum
    > coefficients *C*~0~, *C*~1~, and *C*~2~, with Muskingum *K* =
    > *t~c~* and *x* = 0 for the linear reservoir.

c.  Perform the indicated flow routing through the hypothetical
    > reservoir. Plot the inflow "instantaneous hydrograph" and outflow
    > hydrograph on the same graph. Remember that the hydrographs begin
    > with zero flow.

d.  If you have worked Problem 6.15, compare the hydrographs by the two
    > methods.

> This chapter on **open-channel flow** is limited to coverage of
> steady-flow problems, such as **uniform flow** and **nonuniform
> flow**. Unsteady channel flow hydraulics is beyond the scope of this
> text but is available in more advanced fluid mechanics references.
> Channel and floodplain computations of **water surface profiles** are
> critical to defining levels of flood inundation and are normally
> treated as steady-flow problems.
>
> Uniform open-channel flow is the hydraulic condition in which the
> water depth and the channel cross section do not change over some
> reach of the channel. These criteria require that the energy grade
> line, water surface, and channel bottom are all parallel. In other
> words, the total energy change over the channel reach is exactly equal
> to the energy losses of boundary fric- tion and turbulence.
>
> Uniform flow is eventually established over any long channel reach
> that has constant flow and an unchanging channel cross section. Strict
> uni- form flow is rare in natural streams because of the constantly
> changing chan- nel conditions. But it is often assumed in natural
> streams for engineering calculations, with the understanding that the
> results are general approxima- tions of the actual hydraulic
> conditions. Uniform flow assumptions should not be made in cases where
> a well-defined and consistent channel does not exist and where rapidly
> varying flow is caused by changes in the channel. Man-made channels
> are usually very consistent, and uniform flow calcula- tions are much
> more exact for them.

> Two uniform flow equations are frequently used for open-channel flow
> problems: the Chezy formula and Manning's equation, which relate the
> fol- lowing variables:
>
> *A* = cross-sectional area of channel,
>
> *V* = channel velocity,
>
> *P* = the wetted perimeter of the channel,
>
> *R* = hydraulic radius, or cross-sectional area *A* divided by the
> wetted perimeter *P*,
>
> *S* = energy slope, which is equal to the slope of the channel bed
> under the uniform flow assumptions,
>
> *C* or *n* = roughness coefficient, related to the friction loss
> associated with water flowing over the bottom and sides of the
> channel.
>
> The Chezy formula was developed in 1775; it relates channel velocity
> to roughness, hydraulic radius, and channel slope:
>
> *V* = *C* 1*RS*. (7--1)
>
> The *C* factor can be related to Darcy's friction factor *f*, used in
> pipe flow, with the relationship
>
> *C* = 18*g*\>*f*, (7--2)
>
> where *g* is the gravitational constant.
>
> The Chezy equation is based on two main assumptions: the frictional
> force is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the uniform
> flow assumption that the gravity force is balanced by the frictional
> resistance of the stream. The Chezy equation has been used for
> pressure pipe flow as well as open channel flow. The Chezy *C*
> coefficient for open channel conditions can be calculated using
> relationships from Chow (1959).
>
> For most present applications, however, Manning's equation is used
> instead of the Chezy formula for open-channel computations. Manning's
> equa- tion was presented in 1890; it describes roughness with the
> Manning's rough- ness coefficient *n*:
>
> *V* = [1]{.underline} *R*^2\>3^1*S*. (7--3)
>
> The roughness coefficients were originally developed in the metric
> system (m and s), and a conversion coefficient must be used to apply
> Manning's equation with U.S. customary units:
>
> *V* = [1.49]{.underline} *R*^2\>3^1*S*. (7--4)
>
> The conversion coefficient 1.49 is the cube root of 3.28, which
> converts m to ft. A dimensional analysis of *n* shows units of
> *TL*^-1\>3^ and illustrates a theoretical problem with Manning's
> equation. The empirical nature of the relationship does not restrict
> its usefulness, however, and it is widely used to solve numerous types
> of open-channel flow problems.
>
> The selection of the roughness coefficient *n* is usually based on
> "best
>
> engineering judgment" or on values prescribed by municipal design
> ordinances. Several tables are available in the general literature for
> the selec- tion of Manning's roughness coefficient for a particular
> open channel (see Table 7--1 or Chow, 1959).

> **SPECIFIC ENERGY AND CRITICAL**

**FLOW**

> **Specific energy** is a case of **total energy** that can be defined
> for any location along an open channel. The total energy can be
> defined as the sum of the pressure head, the elevation head, and the
> velocity head for any cross sec- tion. In its simplest form, the
> energy equation becomes

*p*

*H* = g + *z* +

> *V*2 , (7--5)
>
> 2*g*
>
> where g = r*g* and *y* = *p*\>g = depth. Specific energy *E* at a
> single section is referenced to the channel bed and therefore is a sum
> of depth *y* and **velocity head** *V*^2^ 2*g*:

*E* = *y* +

> For simplicity, the following discussion is limited to a wide

> Figure 7--3 shows the variation of depth as a function of *E* for a
> given flow rate. It can be seen that for a given flow rate and
> specific energy, there are two possible values of depth *y*, called
> alternate depths. The curve for constant *q* gives a curve of depth
> values and the corresponding values of
>
> *E.* As *q* increases, the curves are shifted to the right. For each

> from supercritical to subcritical flow, a **hydraulic jump** will
> occur, as described in Section 7.8. By measuring the depth at a

> over a weir or a free outfall with subcritical flow in the channel
> prior to the control section. Critical depth may also occur in a

> In an open channel or natural stream the effect of a grade or slope
> tends to produce a flow with a continually increasing velocity along

> increases with veloc- ity, and eventually the two will be in balance,

> the flow is nonuniform, and is called **gradually varied flow** if
> changing conditions occur over a long distance. **Rapidly varied
> flow** occurs when there is an abrupt change or transition confined to
> a short distance. Rapid flow is covered in more advanced texts that
> address fluid mechanics and open channel flow (Chow, 1959; Wylie and
> Streeter, 1978).
>
> Gradually varied flow can occur along the profile of a channel or
> natural stream, at changes in cross-sectional shape or size, at bends
> in the stream, and at structures such as dams, bridges, or weirs. Of
> particular interest in watershed analysis and floodplain hydraulics is
> the case of the natural stream and the impact associated with bridge
> or culvert crossings, especially in urban areas. This represents one
> of the most complex applica- tions of nonuniform flow theory, and
> computer models have been written to handle all of the necessary
> computations. An example of a very popular flood profile model is the
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-2 model (Hydrologic Engineering
> Center, 1982, 1990), which is described in detail later in this
> chapter (Sections 7.9 to 7.14). HEC-2 is described in more detail in
> Hoggan (1997) and in the user's manual (HEC, 1990). The new version of

> in Equation (7--27). The water surface slope *dy dx* is positive, and
> as *y* increases, the water slope approaches *S*~0~ and the free
> surface approaches the horizontal. As depth increases, velocity must
> decrease gradually to maintain constant *Q*. The *M*1 profile
> typically occurs where dams, bridges, or other control structures tend
> to create a backwater effect along a stream \[see Fig. 7--7(a)\]. For
> a uniform, prismatic channel, Equation (7--21) can be solved using the
> **standard step method** depicted in Example 7--5. Lengths upstream of
> the dam are calcu- lated incrementally as depths are gradually
> decreased toward *y~n~*, since the depth *y* will asymptotically
> approach normal depth at some point upstream. Accuracy of the
> resulting calculation depends on the number of increments selected
> between the starting water surface at the dam and the value of *y~n~*.

> **Horizontal and Adverse Slope Cases**
>
> The *H*2 and *H*3 profiles correspond to the *M*2 and *M*3 curves for
> *S*~0~ = 0. *H*1 cannot exist, since for *S*~0~ = 0, normal depth is
> infinite. The profile slope can be determined from Equation (7--21),
> but this profile can exist only for a short section contained in more
> complex channel reaches, since flow cannot continue indefinitely on a
> horizontal bed.
>
> The adverse slope, *S*~0~ 6 0, occurs where flows sometimes move
> against gravity; as in the case of horizontal slopes, the adverse
> slope can occur only for a short section in a more complex channel
> system. In some natural channel systems, there are occasional reaches
> where these conditions can and do occur.
>
> The hydraulic jump is covered in detail in most fluid mechanics
> textbooks (Daugherty et al., 1985; Fox and McDonald, 1985). The
> transition from supercritical to subcritical flow produces a marked
> discontinuity in the sur- face, characterized by a steep upward slope
> of the profile and a significant loss of energy through turbulence.
> The hydraulic jump can best be explained by reference to the *M*3
> curve of Table 7--2 and Figure 7--8, downstream of a sluice gate. The
> flow decelerates because the mild slope is not great enough to
> maintain constant supercritical flow, and the specific energy *E*
> decreases as the depth increases. When downstream conditions require a
> change to subcritical flow, the need for the change cannot be
> telegraphed upstream. Theory calls for a vertical slope of the water
> surface. Therefore, a hydraulic jump occurs and flow changes from
> supercritical to subcritical conditions.
>
> When flow at a section is supercritical and downstream conditions
> require a change to subcritical flow, the abrupt change in depth
> involves a significant energy loss through turbulent mixing. A jump
> will form when slope changes from steep to mild, as on the apron at
> the base of a spillway. In fact, stilling basins below spillways are
> designed to dissipate the damaging energy of supercritical velocities,
> and downstream erosion is held in check. An equation can be derived
> for horizontal or very mild slopes to relate depth before and after

> **INTRODUCTION TO THE HEC-RAS**

**MODEL**

> The HEC-2 model was originally developed in the 1970s by the
> Hydrologic Engineering Center (1982) of the U.S. ACOE. The program was
> updated to HEC-RAS in 1995 with an easy-to-use graphical user
> interface (GUI). The program is designed to calculate water surface
> profiles for steady, gradually varied flow in natural or man-made
> channels. The computational procedure is based on solution of the
> one-dimensional energy equation \[Eq. (7--16)\] using the standard
> step method. The program can be applied to floodplain manage- ment and
> flood insurance studies to evaluate **floodway encroachments** and to
> delineate **flood hazard** zones. The model can also be used to
> evaluate effects on water surface profiles of channel improvements and
> levees, altered flow values, as well as the presence of bridges or
> other structures in the floodplain. The main objective of the HEC-RAS
> program is to compute water surface elevations at cross-section
> locations of interest along a river or stream, for given flow values.
> Data requirements include flow regime, starting elevation, flow rate,
> loss coefficients, roughness, cross-sectional geometry, and reach
> lengths. Profile computations begin at a cross section with known or
> assumed starting conditions and proceed upstream for subcritical flow
> or downstream for super- critical flow. Subcritical profiles are
> constrained to critical depth or above, and supercritical profiles are
> constrained to critical depth or below. The program will not allow
> profile computations to cross critical depth in most cases because
>
> the governing equations do not apply for *y* = *y~c~*, as discussed in
> Section 7.4. The HEC-RAS program is often used in association with the
> HEC-
>
> HMS program (Chapter 5) for determination of flood flows and flood
> eleva- tions in a particular watershed. Peak flows at various
> locations along the main stream or channel are computed by HEC-HMS for
> a given rainfall.
>
> These peak flows are then used in HEC-RAS to calculate the
> steady-state, nonuniform water surface profile along the stream. For
> example, the 100-yr rainfall could be used in HEC-HMS to calculate
> 100-yr flows, which then could be used in HEC-RAS to predict the
> 100-yr floodplain. RAS can be used to compute storage--outflow
> relationships to be used in HEC-HMS by computing a series of water
> surface profiles and corresponding discharges. HEC-RAS is a very
> sophisticated computer program designed to han-
>
> dle a number of hydraulic computations in a single run in a GUI. The
> main focus in the design of the interface was to make it easy to use
> the software, while still maintaining a high level of efficiency for
> the user. The basic pro- gram and the basic input data requirements
> are relatively easy to learn and are covered in detail in the sections
> that follow. Special features and other options are described in the
> user's manual (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002),
> the book of floodplain modeling using HEC-RAS (Haestad et al., 2003),
> and an earlier text describing HEC-2 (Hoggan, 1997).
>
> Equations presented in Section 7.6 are solved using the standard step
> method to compute an unknown water surface elevation at a particular
> cross section. The next several sections (7.10 to 7.14) present the
> theory behind the HEC- RAS model for natural or man-made streams. The
> new release of HEC-RAS is presented in detail with an example in
> Section 7.14. HEC-RAS is capable of performing one-dimensional water
> surface profile calculations for steady, gradually varied flow in
> natural or constructed channels. The following two equations are
> solved for basic water surface profiles by an iterative proce- dure

The coefficient of discharge *C* varies according to the configuration
of the bridge and the roadway and is reduced in HEC-RAS model whenever
the weir or bridge is submerged by high tailwater. Typically, discharge
coeffi- cient value *C* ranges from 2.5 to 3.1 for broad-crested weirs
when no tailwa- ter effect occurs. For high tailwater elevation, HEC-RAS
is able to automatically reduce the amount of weir flow to account for
the submer- gence on the weir. Submergence is defined as a ratio of the
water depth above the minimum weir elevation on the downstream side
divided by the height of the energy gradeline above the minimum weir
elevation on the upstream side. When the weir is highly submerged,
HEC-RAS program automatically switches to calculating the upstream water
surface by the energy equation instead of using the pressure and weir
flow equation. The user can set up the criteria for when to switch to
energy-based computations.

> Sometimes combination of low flows or pressure flow occurs with weir
> flow. Such flows are handled by HEC-RAS using an iterative procedure
> to balance energy elevations and computed flow rate.
>
> **Cross-Section Layout for Bridge Modeling**
>
> Figure 7--12 illustrates the cross-section requirements for bridge
> modeling. In order to perform computation properly, HEC-RAS program
> requires four key cross sections: (1) one cross section downstream of
> the bridge where flow is not affected by the bridge, (2) one just
> downstream of the bridge, (3) one just upstream of the bridge, and (4)
> one cross section located far enough upstream to be out of the
> backwater influence. Based on these four chosen cross sections,
> HEC-RAS program automatically adds two more cross sections immediately
> inside the upstream and downstream bridge faces. Thus, in HEC-RAS,
> bridge modeling is usually performed with a total of six cross
> sections, with four sec- tions provided by the user and two more
> developed by the program.
>
> The spacing of cross sections downstream of the bridge should be based
> on a 4:1 expansion of flow, which corresponds to 1 ft laterally for
> every 4 ft traveled in the flow direction. This phenomenon is shown in
> Figure 7--14.

> the expansion and contraction criteria should be used to limit the
> lateral extent of any intermediate (inserted) cross sections.
>
> **Ineffective Area Option**
>
> **Effective flow area** is that portion of the total cross-sectional
> area where flow velocity is normal to the cross section in the
> downstream direction. Any other areas that do not convey flow in the
> downstream direction are called **ineffective flow areas**. Figure
> 7--15 illustrates some examples of ineffective flow areas created by
> the presence of bridges.
>
> The ineffective flow area may be eliminated from consideration by
> defining the top of road and low chord profiles of a bridge. The
> ineffective area option in HEC-RAS may be used to "block out" portions
> of the chan- nel cross section that are not effective in conveying
> flow downstream. For example, all flow can be restricted to a channel
> cross section until the com- puted water surface elevation exceeds the
> elevation of one or both channel banks. Encroachment stations for a
> cross section can be considered using

> window.
>
> Detailed discussion of applications of the ineffective area option,
> together with coefficients for bridge and culvert modeling, are
> contained in the HEC-RAS user's manual (Hydrologic Engineering Center,
> 2000) and in books on floodplain modeling using HEC-RAS (Haestad et
> al., 2003) and in Hoggan (1997).
>
> After the HEC-RAS program is executed for a stream reach, a detailed
> output for each profile appears. Summary tables provide the basic
> informa- tion to define water surface elevation (WSEL), channel
> velocity (VCH), area, flow rate (*Q*), top width, and a host of other
> variables that could be requested. HEC-RAS could also be used to
> evaluate

1.  effects of altered (increased or decreased) peak flows from urban
    development or reservoir storage,

2.  effects of additional bridge crossings or altered bridge openings,

3.  effects of altering roughness coefficients or channel sizes, and

4.  effects of changing the starting water surface elevation downstream
    (i.e., at the confluence with a larger stream).

> Finally, HEC-RAS can be used to generate a series of water surface
> eleva- tions and the corresponding flows to generate a
> storage--discharge relation for HEC-HMS flood routing. Thus, HEC-HMS
> and HEC-RAS together provide powerful computer tools for hydrologic
> analysis and design. More details can be found in Hoggan (1997) and
> the HEC user manuals, and a detailed example is provided at the end of
> this chapter.

> **HEC-RAS FEATURES**
>
> The impetus behind the creation of HEC-RAS was the desire to use the
> com- putational power of HEC-2 but present it in a very easy-to-use
> format. Several other improvements have been made. HEC-RAS is able to
> operate with mixed regime conditions, provided the proper boundary
> conditions are input into the program. HEC-RAS also includes the
> ability to model inline weirs and gates and multiple culvert openings,
> and has a new method for handling piers on bridges. The discussion of
> HEC-RAS that follows is designed to give the student a basic overview
> of the program and an appreciation for its strength as a hydraulic
> modeling tool. Its flexibility has been enhanced as its data are used
> in conjunction with other programs, as seen later in the chapter. For
> a more complete presentation of the program details, please refer to
> the HEC- RAS user's manual, which is downloadable, along with HEC-RAS
> itself, from the U.S. ACOE website at
> [www.hec.usace.army.mil.](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/) In order to
> better intro- duce HEC-RAS, a model set up will be shown from a
> project on Big Creek, Texas, a creek that flows about 25 miles
> southwest of Houston.
>
> **Creating a Project**
>
> HEC-RAS divides the necessary input into two categories: geometric
> data and flow data. Both can be accessed through the Edit menu in the
> main program window or by clicking on one of the shortcut buttons in
> the same window. Doing so takes the user into either the Geometric
> Data Editor or the Steady Flow Editor. Each project has a main project
> file, which contains a list of all supporting files associated with
> that project, including geometry, flow, plan, and output files. A
> project can hold many different geometry and flow files and each
> combination of geometry and flow files that creates a plan file.
> Finally, the result of each run is then stored as an output file.
>
> **Geometric Data**
>
> The Geometric Data Editor window is where all physical and
> topographical data are input. The first step in creating a model is to
> click on a button on the left side of the window labeled **River
> Reach**. The user is then able to click the mouse in the viewing area
> and draw the river reach. The drawing in the window has no effect on
> the program computationally, so it does not need to be an accurate
> visual representation of what the reach looks like.
>
> Once the reach is drawn, the cross sections can be entered. As cross
> sec- tions are created, they are automatically placed on the drawing
> of the river reach. Clicking on the **Cross Section** button on the
> left of the Geometric Data Editor brings up the Cross Section Data
> window. To create a new cross section,
>
> click on **Add a new Cross Section** in the Options menu. The program
> will prompt the user for the river station number. After the number is
> entered, one can input data for the cross section into the program.
> HEC-RAS requires a variety of data types. This window is where points
> along the cross section and their elevations are assigned. Distances
> to the next downstream cross section are needed along the left
> overbank (LOB), the channel, and the right overbank (ROB). Channel
> bank stations as well as contraction and expansion coefficients are
> also necessary. Note that the cross sections are shown from the
> perspective of the user looking downstream standing in the middle of
> the cross section.
>
> ![](./images/media/image33.png){width="4.499749562554681in"
> height="4.525249343832021in"}The Manning *n* values can be entered in
> one of two different ways (see Table 7--1 for values). If there is no
> variation in the *n* value within a portion of the cross section, such
> as the ROB, then the *n* values can be directly entered into the
> existing fields. If there is variation in *n* values within a part of
> the cross section, choosing **Horizontal Variation in *n* Values**
> from the Options menu creates a new column next to the cross-sectional
> elevation field. Values in this column must be entered only when there
> is a change in *n*-values going from left to right across the cross
> section. Figure 7--16 shows an example of a completed Cross Section
> data input window.

>
> Other important options are accessed from the Cross Section Data win-
> dow. Areas of ineffective flow as well as levees and blocked
> obstructions are defined from the Options menu. Areas of ineffective
> flow are areas in which flow is hampered. Examples of ineffective flow
> are often seen on the sides of the channel just next to bridges, where
> the water is rapidly contracting or expanding (see Fig. 7--15).
> Clicking on **Plot Cross Section** in the Plot menu brings up a plot
> of the cross section (Fig. 7--17). This is a good way to check if all
> the points are entered correctly and is another advantage of HEC-RAS
> compared to the original HEC-2. HEC-RAS cross-section data can be
> checked by simply clicking through the cross-section plots on the
> screen, using up and down arrows. The zoom feature is particularly
> useful to study specific details.
>
> Bridges in HEC-RAS require four cross sections: two just a few feet
> away from each face of the bridge, one far enough upstream that flow
> has not yet begun to contract, and one far enough downstream that flow
> has completely expanded (Fig. 7--14). These cross sections are created
> just as any others, and clicking on the **Brdg/Culv** button in the
> Geometric Data Editor opens the Bridge Culvert Data window. From this
> window both bridges and culverts can be cre- ated. Click on Options
> and select **Add a Bridge and/or Culvert** to begin the process of
> creating the bridge. Defining a bridge's deck or roadway is very simi-
> lar to defining the elevations and points along a cross section and
> can be done in the **Deck/Roadway** editor. The only difference is
> that two elevations must be
>
> defined: the top chord and the low chord, which must be entered for
> both the upstream and downstream faces of the bridge (Fig. 7--13).
> These values are often the same for the two faces, so HEC-RAS provides
> a copy up-to-down button that simply copies the chord elevation data
> from one face to the other. A detailed analysis of the culvert program
> within HEC-RAS is contained in Section 9.3.
>
> HEC-RAS allows the user to input individual bridge piers and to define
> the height and width of each pier, which in turn allows for pier
> widths that vary with elevation. Piers are defined in their own
> window, labeled **Pier** in the **Bridge Culvert Data** window. The
> **Pier** window is used for defining the size and location of the
> piers. A third window can be used to input sloping abutments. Finally,
> a fourth window allows the user to determine the method that HEC- RAS
> uses in calculating losses through the bridge. An option is even
> included for HEC-RAS to use the calculation method that results in the
> highest energy loss, which is a useful option that results in a more
> conservative model than if a single approach were used. Figure 7--18
> shows a typical bridge section in HEC-RAS, and the zoom feature can be
> used to see more details.

>
> **Flow Data**
>
> The second major category of input data in HEC-RAS is flow data. HEC-
> RAS requires the user to select the reach and all the cross sections
> where a change in flow occurs. Once a flow is selected for a cross
> section, that flow is used on all cross sections upstream of the first
> until the program encoun- ters a different flow. HEC-RAS also
> maintains the ability to model multiple profiles simultaneously. This
> allows the user to easily compare, for example, the 10-yr, 25-yr,
> 50-yr, and 100-yr floods on one graph. As mentioned before, the Steady
> Flow Data Editor is accessed by clicking **Edit** in the main pro-
> gram window, and then clicking **Steady Flow Data**. The flow data
> that are used are often generated by HEC-HMS and can be imported into
> HEC- RAS. This iteration between RAS and HMS can be used to compute
> and refine storage--outflow relationships that normally are used for
> flood routing in HMS (see Fig. 5--5).
>
> The Steady Flow Data Editor has one other job of major importance, and
> that is setting the boundary conditions for the reach. A boundary
> condi- tion must be selected for each profile, and one must keep in
> mind whether the flow is subcritical, supercritical, or mixed regime
> flow, as this determines whether to use downstream, upstream, or both
> boundary conditions. It should be noted that for floodplain analysis,
> downstream boundary condi- tions are generally used most often. Four
> types of boundary conditions can be used: known water surfaces,
> critical depth, normal depth, and given rating curves. Only one
> condition needs to be defined.
>
> **Running and Viewing Results**
>
> Once all geometric data, flow data, and boundary conditions have been
> entered, HEC-RAS can run the simulation. Click on **Run** and then
> **Steady Flow Analysis** in the main program window. This brings up a
> new win- dow. If the user has several flow or geometry files, he/she
> can then choose which set of files to run. Each combination of
> geometry and flow files is stored as a separate plan, which can be
> given a unique name. Each time a new plan is computed, an output file
> is generated and saved with the results.
>
> Results of HEC-RAS are useful in their ability to create various plots
> and tables of the output results. The displayed data are easily chosen
> from a menu so that the user is able to customize the data that are of
> interest. The cross-section output table lists a number of variables
> and associated values computed for each particular cross section. A
> typical cross-section output table is shown in Figure 7--19. All of
> the plots and tables that will be dis- cussed in this section can be
> found by clicking on the **View** menu in the main program window.
>
> A cross-section plot is one of the plots that are available (see Fig.
> 7--17 or 7--18). It plots any cross section in the reach and displays
> the water surfaces from as many or as few of the flow profiles as the
> user chooses.

> Cross-section output table.
>
> It can also display the energy grade lines and the critical depth,
> along with numerous other options. Other cross sections can be easily
> viewed by click- ing on the arrow keys above the window. The water
> surface profile plot is another plot that displays the water surface
> and energy grade lines as a profile that runs lengthwise down the
> center of the channel (Fig. 7--20a). This plot can also graph the bank
> as well as the bridge stations on either side of the channel. This is
> a useful feature in that it shows not only where the water is
> overtopping the banks and bridges, but also by how much.
>
> Another useful tool is the X-Y-Z perspective plot. Figure 7--20b shows
> the reach in three dimensions; the user may rotate the image about two
> axes. There is also a zoom-in command to allow the user to study a
> particular segment in more detail. This gives the user an easy way to
> see the relative extent that the floodwaters have traveled outside the
> bank and the relative slope change as one moves downstream along the
> profile. This plot can also display multiple profiles at once, making
> it easy to com- pare floods of different magnitude. This capability is
> a great improvement over HEC-2, allowing the user to visualize the
> floodplain in three-dimen- sional perspective.
>
> Other options that exist in the View menu include the ability to
> create rating curves for any cross section, and tables that provide a
> vast array of calculated properties for each cross section and
> profile. A powerful feature

> of all graphs and tables in HEC-RAS is the ability to customize the
> output. The user has great freedom in choosing which variables to
> display in a given form of output. Also, HEC-RAS, in the File menu of
> the main program window, can generate a report. Here as well, the user
> specifies what sort of information goes in the report. This is an
> important feature because other programs can use generated reports as
> input files, as described in a later section.
>
> **Channel Modification**
>
> Thus far, all the tools necessary to create and examine a stream or
> channel have been introduced. However, the job of the engineer is not
> always just to model the flooding, but to find ways to alleviate it.
> In a typical hydraulic analysis, this may involve making improvements
> to the channel in the form of deepening or widening a section. HEC-RAS
> has a window called **Channel Modification** that makes improving the
> channel a very simple process. The Channel Modification window can be
> found in the Tools menu in the Geo- metric Data Editor. The improved
> channel is referred to as the cut. Channel modification entails
> telling the model what range of cross sections will be widened and
> what the bottom width, side slope, and *n* values of the cut will
> become, along with a few other specifications.
>
> The user begins by entering data into a part of the window entitled
> **Set Range of Values**. The range of cross sections to be modified is
> entered first, then the other properties of the cut. The Channel
> Modification window allows the invert elevations to be set in a number
> of ways. The elevations can remain the same, they can be set to a
> constant elevation, or a slope can be extended upstream from the
> downstream endpoint or downstream from the upstream endpoint. When the
> **Set Range of Values** portion of the win- dow is completed, the
> **Apply Cuts to Selected Range** button is clicked. A table containing
> data from all the cross sections in the reach, not just the ones being
> modified, can be found at the bottom of the Channel Modifica- tion
> window. Once the cuts have been applied, the updated data appear in
> this table of cross sections. From here the user can make
> modifications to individual cross sections. Also, if the new channel
> does not run along the centerline of the existing channel, the center
> station must be entered in this table. Finally, the **Compute Cuts**
> button is pressed to update all the changes. A useful feature is the
> **Cut and Fill Areas** button. Pressing this button pro- duces a
> report in tabular form that shows all of the calculated volumes of
> soil that must be excavated for the proposed channel, which is a good
> way to estimate the cost of the project. The modified channel can then
> be saved as a new geometry file and processed in the simulation.
>
> **Unsteady Flow Simulation**
>
> Version 3.0 of HEC-RAS allows, for the first time, for the unsteady
> flow analysis within a floodplain, and the user can actually view the
> change of
>
> depth as a function of both space and time. The Unsteady NETwork
> simula- tor (UNET) was modified for HEC-RAS in order to simulate
> one-dimen- sional unsteady flow through a full network of open
> channels. In addition to solving the network system, UNET provides the
> user with the ability to apply several external and internal boundary
> conditions, including flow and stage hydrographs, rating curves, gated
> and uncontrolled spillways, pump stations, bridges, culverts, and
> levee systems. The UNET program was originally developed by Barkau
> (1992).
>
> The program uses an unsteady flow solver at each node for each time
> step, and data are organized for each cross section. All HEC-RAS
> output options as well as complete animation of cross section,
> profile, and 3-D plots are available. This feature allows the user to
> view the dynamics of a flood wave as it moves downstream. As modern
> floodplain problems become more complex and the demand grows for more
> accurate solutions, the use of UNET within HEC-RAS will continue to
> increase. Other programs are also available to solve the dynamic
> equations presented in Chapter 4 and provide output as a flood wave
> moves downstream. A detailed unsteady- state example is provided in
> the textbook website hydrology.rice.edu.
>
> **EXAMPLE 7--7**
>
> **APPLICATION OF HEC-RAS FOR BIG CREEK**
>
> Big Creek is a small creek located about 25 miles southwest of Hous-
> ton, Texas. It is typical of many of the waterways in the Houston area
> in that it is characterized by a mild slope in the channel bed and a
> flat topography in the area surrounding. A portion of the creek has
> been modeled in HEC-RAS and will be used as the basis for the example.
> The project file is accessible to students in the textbook website
> listing in Appendix E. It contains a flow file and a geometry file of
> the existing conditions. The interested student should implement the
> channelization and bridge modifications for Big Creek by following
> along with direc- tions in the book.
>
> The problem is that a builder would like to develop a very large tract
> of land near the upstream portion of Big Creek, to consist of new
> houses and shopping centers. A hydrologic study is commissioned, and
> it is determined that the development would add 2200 cfs of additional
> flow to the 100-year storm, which has an existing flow rate of 4825
> cfs at the mouth of the reach. This consequently raises the water
> surface elevation at the cross section farthest upstream to 57.54 ft,
> an increase of 1.7 ft above the existing elevation of 55.84 ft.
> Regulations require that a development cannot raise the water surface
> elevation downstream of the development by more than 0.01 ft. The
> developer has two options. The first is to build a detention pond in
> order to alleviate the impact of increased flow. However, this would
> tie up some of his land, which is at
>
> a premium in this part of Houston. Therefore, the builder is
> interested in the feasibility of channelizing the portion of Big Creek
> downstream of the point of impact that has been modeled.
>
> In addition to the increased flow rates, the HEC-RAS model shows that
> an existing bridge is causing a backwater effect in the reach of
> interest. The bridge is an old one and was poorly designed, such that
> it increases the water surface elevation by 0.37 ft just upstream of
> the bridge. In addition to the effect of channelization, the effect of
> raising the bridge should also be considered.
>
> The model of Big Creek consists of 25 cross sections and two bridges
> over a reach length of 25,025 ft (4.74 mi). The current floodplain
> ranges in width from about 300 to about 3000 ft. The greatest changes
> in width due to increased flow in the creek occur in the upstream
> portion of the watershed due to geometry of the main channel. The
> depth of floodwaters outside the creek banks generally ranges from 1.0
> to 5.0 ft.
>
> In examining the geometry of the existing creek, one sees that the
> creek bed has a width of 60 ft. We enter the **Channel Modification**
> win- dow. We begin by setting the range of cross sections to be
> channelized. We choose to begin at Section 109047 and end at Section
> 84629, a distance of 24,418 ft. Continuing in the **Select Range of
> Values** section of the win- dow, we select center cuts and a width of
> 80 ft. The invert elevation is left blank, meaning that the existing
> depth of the channel will remain the same. A left and right side slope
> of 3 is chosen, meaning that the side slope is equal to 3 ft
> horizontally to every 1 ft vertically. The *n*-value for the cut is
> entered to be .03, which is a typical value used for channelized
> reaches. Once these values are entered, the **Apply Cuts to Selected
> Range** button is pushed. If there are no other modifications that
> need to be made to the cut, then the **Compute Cuts** button can be
> pushed. As mentioned before, a useful feature of the Channel
> Modification program is the **Cut and Fill Areas** button. This
> calculates and reports the total volume of soil that must be
> excavated. We see that it is necessary to remove 360,988 yd^3^ for
> this project. Given a base estimate of \$4.00/yd^3^, it is estimated
> that this project will cost \$1.44 million.
>
> Finally, the **Create Modified Geometry** button is pushed, and a new
> window is opened. The new geometry is saved as a new geometry file
> with a name such as "80ft channel." Finally, we return to the HEC- RAS
> main window and select **Run**, then **Steady Flow Analysis**. From
> the dropdown menu, we choose "80ft channel" as our geometry file, 100
> yr dev as our flow file, and then run the program. We can view the
> profile output table and see that the upstream water surface elevation
> has been lowered to 55.61 ft, which is almost exactly what it was
> before the proposed development. Therefore, this channelization
> project was successful in reaching its goal of properly lowering the
> water surface elevation.
>
> It is now the responsibility of the developer to weigh the advantages
> of the channelization against the economic and environmental costs of
> the project. Channelization often leads to destruction of the riparian
> habitat, and this must be seriously considered. The developer may also
> look into the option of using an off-line detention pond as a means of
> flood attenuation, which may not create the environmental damage that
> channelization may incur. The option of using a detention pond is
> explored using HEC-HMS, which is discussed in Chapter 5.
>
> The issue of raising the bridge needs to be examined. The bridge in
> question is located at Section 97030. The area underneath the bridge
> that is open to flow is too small for the flow at the rate that it
> must pass through, and the physical mass of the bridge structure is
> creating a dam- ming effect on the water. To examine this backwater
> effect, open a water surface profile plot from the **View** menu in
> the main project win- dow. The sudden increase seen in the water
> surface elevation upstream of bridge Section 97030 indicates that the
> bridge is holding water back. One solution to this problem is to
> create a greater area for flow by rais- ing the old bridge. In
> HEC-RAS, the user enters the Deck/Roadway window from the Bridge
> Culvert Data Editor. The high and low chords can be altered so that
> over the channel section, the high and low chords are raised to 57 and
> 55 ft, respectively, and pier heights should also be mod- ified, using
> Pier Editor. The changes are saved and the results are run in HEC-RAS.
>
> The final results are easily compared using the water surface profile
> plot. The newest geometry, with the improved channel and raised
> bridge, can be compared against the original conditions. It is seen
> that down- stream of bridge Section 97030, the two water surface
> profiles match up almost exactly. Upstream of bridge Section 97030,
> the original conditions actually have a slightly higher water surface
> elevation due to the back- water effect at the bridge. It is seen then
> that the channelization has maintained the water surface elevation,
> and the raised bridge actually improves the water surface elevation.

> **PROPERTIES OF GROUND WATER**
>
> **Vertical Distribution of Ground Water**
>
> Ground water can be characterized according to vertical distribution,
> as shown in Figure 8--3, which indicates the main divisions of
> subsurface water. The unsaturated zone or **vadose zone** extends
> above the water table and includes the soil water zone down to the
> water table, which divides the unsat- urated zone from the saturated
> zone. The **water table** is defined as the level to which water will
> rise in a well drilled into the saturated zone. Thickness may vary
> from a few feet for high water table conditions to several hundred
> feet in arid regions of the country, such as Arizona or New Mexico.
>
> The **soil water zone,** which extends from the ground surface down
> through the major root zone, varies with soil type and vegetation. The
> amount of water present in the soil water zone depends primarily on
> recent exposure to rainfall and infiltration. Following rainfall, the
> water content in this zone will decrease due to downward drainage as
> well as losses to evaporation and root uptake. **Hygroscopic water**
> remains adsorbed to the surface of soil grains, while **gravitational
> water** drains through the soil under the influence of gravity.
> **Capillary water** is held in the zone just above the water table and
> exists because water can be pulled upward from the water table by
> surface tension. The capillary zone, or fringe, extends from the water
> table up to the limit of **capillary rise,** which varies inversely
> with the pore size of the soil and directly with the surface tension.
> Capillary rise can range from a few cm for fine gravel to more than
> 200 cm for silt (Todd and Mays, 2005). Just above the water table
> almost all pores contain capillary water, but then the water content

>
> In the saturated zone, which occurs beneath the water table, the
> **porosity** is a direct measure of the water contained per unit
> volume, expressed as the ratio of the volume of voids to the total
> volume. Porosity ranges from 25% to 35% for most aquifer systems. Only
> a portion of the water can be removed from the saturated zone by
> drainage or by pumping from a well. **Specific yield** is defined as
> the volume of water released from an unconfined aquifer per unit
> surface area per unit head decline in the water table. Fine-grained
> materials yield little water, whereas coarse-grained materials provide
> sig- nificant water and thus serve as aquifers. In general, specific
> yields for unconsolidated formations fall in the range of 7% to 25%.
>
> For water supply or to study the characteristics of aquifer systems,
> wells are often installed. A **well** is a vertical hole dug into the
> earth, usually cased with metal or PVC plastic up to the land surface.
> Often, the portion of the well hole that is open to the aquifer is
> **screened** to prevent aquifer material from entering the well. A
> vertical penetration used to collect soil or water samples that is not
> cased is called a borehole. Wells are generally placed into the
> saturated zone and are pumped for water supply for municipal, agricul-
> tural, and industrial customers. Wells can also be used for recharge,
> disposal of contaminated water or saltwater, and for water level
> observation. For more detail on well construction methods, see Section
> 8.11.
>
> **Aquifer Systems**
>
> An **aquifer** can be defined as a formation that contains sufficient
> permeable material to yield significant quantities of water to wells
> and springs. Aquifers are generally areally extensive and may be
> overlain or underlain by confining beds. Many aquifers in the United
> States have been extensively evaluated for water supply and for
> contamination problems. Several aquifers of note include the Edwards
> limestone near Austin, Texas, Ogallala in West Texas, and the Floridan
> Aquifer, the subject of a detailed modeling case study in Section
> 8.12.
>
> An **aquiclude** is saturated and is a relatively impermeable
> confining unit, such as clay, that might act as a confining layer
> above or below an aquifer system. An **aquitard** is a saturated, low
> permeability stratum, such as a silty clay, that may leak water from
> one aquifer to another.
>
> Aquifers can be characterized by the porosity of the rock or soil,
> expressed as the ratio of the volume of voids *V~v~* to the total
> volume *V.* Poros- ity may also be expressed by

> r*~m~*
>
> where r*~m~* is the **density** of the grains and r*~b~* is the **bulk
> density**, defined as the oven-dried mass of the sample divided by its
> original volume. Table 8--1 shows a range of porosities for a number
> of aquifer materials, but usually 25% to 30% is assumed for most
> aquifers. Fractured rock or limestone can have lower porosities in the
> range of 1% to 10%.
>
> Unconsolidated geologic materials are normally classified according to
> their size and distribution. Soil classification based on particle
> size is shown in Table 8--2. Particle sizes are measured by
> mechanically sieving grain sizes larger than 0.05 mm and measuring
> rates of settlement for smaller particles in suspension. A typical
> particle-size distribution graph is shown in Figure 8--5. The
> **uniformity coefficient**, defined as *D*~60~ *D*~10~, indicates the
> relative uniformity of the material. A uniform material such as fine
> beach sand has a low uniformity coefficient, while a well-graded
> material such as **alluvium** has a high coefficient (Fig. 8--5).

> Figure 8--6 shows a vertical cross section illustrating unconfined and
> con- fined aquifers. An unconfined aquifer is one in which a water
> table exists, which often rises and falls with changes in rainfall and
> recharge. Shallow wells are usu- ally placed to help define the level
> of water and the general direction of flow, based on the slope of the
> water table. Confined aquifers occur where ground water is confined by
> a relatively impermeable stratum, or confining unit, and water is
> under pressure greater than atmospheric. If a well penetrates such an
> aquifer, the water level will rise above the bottom of the confining
> unit. If the water level rises above the land surface, a flowing well
> or spring results and is referred to as an **artesian well**. Details
> on wells are provided in Section 8.11.
>
> A recharge area supplies water to a confined aquifer, and such an
> aqui- fer can convey water from the recharge area to locations of
> natural or arti- ficial discharge. The **piezometric surface**
> (potentiometric surface) of a confined aquifer is the hydrostatic
> pressure level of water in the aquifer, defined by the water level
> that occurs in a lined penetrating well. It should be noted that a
> confined aquifer can become unconfined when the surface falls below
> the bottom of the upper confining bed. Contour maps and pro- files can
> be prepared of the water table for an unconfined aquifer or the
> piezometric surface for a confined aquifer. These **equipotential
> lines** are lines of constant head and will be described in more
> detail in Section 8.7. Figure 8--7 depicts a simple flow net, which is
> a set of constant head and orthogonal streamlines to indicate the
> direction of flow (from higher head to lower head) in a ground water
> system.

> takes into storage per unit surface area per unit change in
> piezometric head. For a confined aquifer, values of *S* fall in the
> range of 0.00005 to 0.005, indicating that large pressure changes
> produce small changes in the storage volume. For unconfined aqui-
> fers, a change in storage volume is expressed simply by the product of
> the volume of aquifer lying below the water table at the beginning and
> end of a period of time and the average specific yield of the
> formation. Thus, the storage coefficient for an unconfined aquifer is
> approximately equal to the specific yield, or percentage of aquifer

> **Darcy's Law**
>
> The movement of ground water is well established by hydraulic
> principles reported in 1856 by Henri Darcy, who investigated the flow
> of water through beds of permeable sand. Darcy discovered one of the
> most important laws in hydrology---that the flow rate through porous
> media is proportional to the head loss and inversely proportional to
> the length of the flow path. Darcy's law serves as the basis for
> present-day knowledge of ground water flow and well hydraulics and
> forms the basis for the governing ground water flow equations (Section
> 8.5).

> The negative sign indicates that flow of water is in the direction of

> Thus, actual seepage velocities are usually much higher (by a factor

> **Hydraulic Conductivity**
>
> The hydraulic conductivity of a soil or rock depends on a variety of
> physical factors and is an indication of an aquifer's ability to
> transmit water. Thus, sand aquifers have *K* values many orders of
> magnitude larger than clay units. Table 8--3 indicates representative
> values of hydraulic conductivity for a variety of materials. As can be
> seen, *K* can vary over many orders of magni- tude in an aquifer that
> may contain different types of material. Typical val- ues would be 10
> ^-2^ cm/sec for sand, 10 ^-4^ cm/sec for silt, and 10 ^-7^ cm/sec for
> clay aquifers. Thus, velocities and flow rates can also vary over the
> same range, as expressed by Darcy's law.
>
> **Transmissivity** is a term often used in ground water hydraulics as
> applied to confined aquifers. It is defined as the product of *K* and
> the aver- age saturated thickness of the aquifer, *b*. Hydraulic
> conductivity *K* is usually expressed in m/day (ft/day), and
> transmissivity *T* in m^2^/day (ft^2^/day). An older unit for *T* that
> is still reported in some texts is gal/day/ft. Common conversion
> factors are contained in Table 8--3.

The equation can be used to obtain aquifer constants *S* and *T* by
means of pump- ing tests at fully penetrating wells. It is widely used
because a value of *S* can be determined, only one observation well and
a relatively short pumping period are required, and large portions of
the flow field can be sampled with one test. The assumptions inherent in
the Theis equation should be included,

> since they are often overlooked:

1.  The aquifer is homogeneous, isotropic, uniformly thick, and of infi-
    nite areal extent.

2.  Prior to pumping, the piezometric surface is horizontal.

3.  The fully penetrating well is pumped at a constant rate.

4.  Flow is horizontal within the aquifer.

5.  Storage within the well can be neglected.

6.  Water removed from storage responds instantaneously with a declin-
    ing head.

> These assumptions are seldom completely satisfied for a field problem,
> but the method still provides one of the most useful and accurate
> techniques for aquifer characterization. The complete Theis solution
> requires the graph- ical solution of two equations with four unknowns:

4p*T*

> *W*(*u*), (8--52)
>
> *r* a 4*T*

> *t S*

b *u*. (8--53)

> The relation between *W*(*u*) and *u* must be the same as that between

>
> *r*^2^ *t*, because all other terms are constants in the equations.

> Leaky aquifers represent a unique and complex problem in well

> water is withdrawn both from the lower aquifer and from the saturated
> portion of the overlying aquitard. By creating a lowered piezometric
> surface below the water table, ground water can migrate vertically
> downward and then move horizontally to the well. While steady-state
> conditions in a leaky system are possible, a more general
> nonequilibrium analysis for unsteady flow is more applicable and more
> often occurs in the field. When pumping starts from a well in a leaky

> **Shallow Well Construction**
>
> A **water well** is a vertical hole dug into the earth, usually
> designed for bringing ground water to the surface. Wells can be used
> for pumping, artificial recharge, waste disposal, water level
> observation, and water quality monitoring. A vari- ety of methods
> exist for constructing wells, depending on the flow rate, depth to
> ground water, geologic condition, casing material, and economic
> factors.
>
> Prior to drilling a well in a new area, a test hole is normally
> drilled and a record, or log, is kept of various geologic formations
> and the depths at which they are encountered. Cable tool, rotary, and
> jetting methods are commonly employed for making test holes. Sample
> cuttings are often col- lected at selected depths and later studied
> and analyzed for grain size distri- bution. Borings can be removed
> using a Shelby tube or a split-spoon sampler, and these cores can be
> analyzed for a variety of parameters, such as hydrau- lic
> conductivity, porosity, grain size, texture, and soil classification.
>
> Shallow wells are usually less than 15 m deep and are constructed by
> digging, boring, driving, or jetting methods. Dug wells are generally
> exca- vated by hand and are vertical holes in the ground that
> intersect the water table. A modern domestic dug well should have a
> rock curb, a concrete seal, and a pump to lift water to the surface.
> Bored wells are constructed with hand-operated or power-driven augers,
> available in several shapes and sizes, with cutting blades that bore
> into the ground with a rotary motion. When the blades fill with loose
> earth, the auger is removed from the hole and emptied. Depths up to 30
> m can be achieved under favorable conditions. Hand-bored wells seldom
> exceed 20 cm in diameter.
>
> A continuous-flight power auger has a spiral extending from the bottom
> of the hole to the surface, and sections of the auger may be added as
> depth increases. Cuttings are carried to the surface in the drilling
> process, and depths up to 50 m can be achieved with truck-mounted
> equipment. Hollow- stem augers are often used to construct
> small-diameter wells, which are asso- ciated with waste sites for
> monitoring or pumping. Augers work best in formations that do not
> cave, such as where some clay or silt is present in the aquifer.

> Driven wells consist of a series of pipe lengths driven vertically
> down- ward by repeated impacts into the ground. Water enters the wells
> through a drive point at the lower end, which consists of a screened,
> cylindrical section, protected by a steel cone. Driven wells usually
> have diameters of less than 10 cm, with depths generally below 15 m.
> Yields from driven wells are usu- ally fairly small, but a battery of
> such wells connected to a single pipe and pump are effective for
> lowering water-table elevations. Such a system is known as a
> well-point system and is used for de-watering excavations for
> subsurface construction. Jetted wells are constructed with a
> high-velocity
>
> stream of water directed vertically downward, while the casing that is
> low- ered into the hole conducts the water and cuttings to the
> surface. Small- diameter holes, up to 10 cm, with depths up to 15 m,
> can be installed in unconsolidated formations. Because of the speed of
> installation, jetted wells are useful for observation wells and
> well-point systems.
>
> **Deep Well Construction**
>
> Most deep wells of high capacity are constructed by drilling with a
> cable tool or with one of several rotary methods. Construction
> techniques vary depend- ing on the type of geologic formation, depth
> of the well, and required flow rate. Cable tool drilling is
> accomplished by regular lifting and dropping of a string of tools,
> with a sharp bit on the lower end to break rock by impact. The method
> is most useful for consolidated rock materials to depths of 600 m.
>
> A rapid method for drilling in unconsolidated formations (sands or
> silts) is the rotary method, which consists of drilling with a hollow,
> rotating bit, with drilling mud, or water used to increase efficiency.
> No casing is required with drilling mud, because the mud forms a clay
> lining on the wall of the well.
>
> Drilling mud consists of a suspension of water, bentonite clay, and
> various organic additives. Proper mixture is essential for
> trouble-free drill- ing. This method is used extensively for oil
> wells. Advantages are the rapid drilling rate and the convenience for
> electric logging. Air rotary methods use compressed air in place of
> drilling mud and are convenient for consolidated formations. Drilling
> depths can exceed 150 m under favorable conditions.
>
> **Well Completion and Pumping**
>
> Once a well has been drilled, it must be completed in such a way that
> it remains an efficient producer of water. This may involve
> installation of cas- ing, cementing, placement of well screens, and
> gravel packs. Well casings serve as a lining to maintain an open hole
> up to the ground surface. They provide structural support against
> caving materials and seal out surface water. Casing materials include
> wrought iron, steel, and PVC pipe.
>
> Wells are cemented in the annular space around the casing to prevent
> entrance of water of unsatisfactory quality. Cement grout, which may
> con- tain additives, is usually introduced at the bottom of the space
> to ensure proper sealing. **Grout seals** are common for layered
> aquifers, where it is desirable to pump from one layer while not
> disturbing another. **Well screens**, typically used for
> unconsolidated formations, are perforated sections of pipe of variable
> length that allow ground water to flow into the well. Their main
> purpose is to prevent aquifer material, such as sand or gravel, from
> entering the well and to minimize hydraulic resistance to flow.
> Screens are made of a variety of metals and metal alloys, PVC, and
> wood. Where a well screen is to be surrounded by an artificial
> **gravel pack**, the size of the screen openings is governed by the
> size of the gravel (see Fig. 8--26).
>
> A gravel pack that envelops a well screen is designed to stabilize the
> aquifer and provide an annular zone of high-permeability material. In
> lay- ered systems, gravel packs can provide conduits of flow from one
> layer to another and should be separated by grout plugs. Details on
> gravel-pack material and well-screen sizes are available from Campbell
> and Lehr (1973). Well development follows completion and is designed
> to increase the hydraulic efficiency by removing the finer material
> from the formation sur- rounding the screen. The importance of well
> development is often over- looked but is required to produce
> full-potential yields. Development procedures include pumping,
> surging, use of compressed air, hydraulic jet- ting, chemical
> addition, and use of explosives. The methods are discussed in
>
> Campbell and Lehr (1973) and will not be described in detail here.
>
> For shallow wells, low-capacity and low-head pumps can be used. For
> deeper wells used to supply water for municipal or agricultural needs,
> deep- well turbine and submersible pumps are needed. Pump impellers
> are con- tained in bowls and can be connected in series to deliver
> high heads. They are suspended vertically on a long drive shaft driven
> by a surface-mounted motor. Whenever ground water is pumped and is to
> be used for human consumption, proper sanitary precautions must be
> taken to protect water quality. Surface pollution can enter wells
> through the annular space or through the top of the well itself.
> Cement grout outside the casing and a watertight cover of concrete
> should be installed for protection. Samples of well water should be
> evaluated for quality after development and after periods of excessive
> flooding, if con- tamination is suspected. Wells are often associated
> with septic tank systems in rural areas, and most communities have
> requirements on the distance neces- sary to separate a water well from
> the nearest septic tank as a measure of sanitary protection. Ground
> water contamination in wells is discussed in detail in Freeze and
> Cherry (1979), Bedient et al. (1999), and Charbeneau (2000).

> **Introduction**
>
> Ground water overpumping and aquifer depletion are now a serious prob-
> lem in many parts of the United States and around the world. Aquifers
> in New York, Texas, Idaho, Arizona, Washington, and California have
> all felt the impacts of overpumping and overuse (USGS, 1999).
> Worldwide, the consumption of fresh water is doubling every 20 years,
> which is more than twice the rate of the increase in human population
> (Barlow, 1999). This mas- sive consumption of water is placing
> enormous pressures on areas where aquatic ecosystems dominate,
> especially lakes and wetlands, as in Florida.

> water pumping in the layered, Karst aquifer system near Tampa,
> Florida. Impacts of overpumping are discussed, with a brief

>
> Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) had an existing
> MODFLOW model based on data from 1993, and the original model was
> updated using new information incorporated through 1998. The results
> of present and projected pumping of ground water were evaluated using
> existing and improved numerical ground water flow models, based on the
> original model. The case study provides the student with a unique view
> of how such models are applied for a large and complex aquifer system,
> in order to better manage the water resources in the five-county
> region of southwest Florida.
>
> In Florida, water resources are an integral part of the state's
> welfare, affecting the state's economy, natural environment, and
> future growth pos- sibilities. Florida currently relies on ground
> water for over 90% of its water supply. Florida's increase in
> population in the last few decades has led to additional development
> and an intensified water need for agriculture, industry, and public
> supplies. In order to provide for this additional water use and to
> plan for future growth and demand, the state has worked on developing
> long-range plans for protecting its water resources, at both the state
> and local levels.
>
> One of the state's most stressed areas in terms of water resources is
> located in the Northern Tampa Bay (NTB) region (Fig. 8--27). Ground
> water pumping for water supply in the NTB area, which encompasses part
> or all of Hillsborough, Hernando, Pasco, Pinellas, and Polk counties,
> has doubled in the past 30 years (Fig. 8--28). In 1966, 44.2 million

> **Aquifer Systems and Overpumping**
>
> In order to quantify the ground water effects of pumping in a complex
> sys- tem, it is important to first identify the interactions between
> the ground water and the surface water. Ground water and surface water
> are intricately interconnected in the NTB area because of the Karst
> limestone features that underlie the area. Figure 8--29 shows many of
> the hydraulic links that often exist in Karst systems, such as
> fractures and layering of units. Water enters the ground water system
> through pathways such as rainfall and recharge, and it leaves the
> system through pathways such as runoff, ground water outflow, and
> evapotranspiration. Many interactions are also occurring between the
> different layers of the system. For example, the NTB area has two area
> aquifers, the surficial aquifer and the Floridan Aquifer, which are
> separated by leaky confining beds. Vertical transfer of water occurs
> across these leaky layers and is related to rates of pumping from the
> lower aquifer (Figs. 8--24 and 8--29).

> The NTB MODFLOW model area covers approximately 1500 square miles and
> includes two principal aquifers, the surficial aquifer and the Upper
> Floridan Aquifer. The NTB model represents these aquifers as three
> layers, with layer 1 simulating the surficial aquifer, layer 2
> simulating the Tampa/ Suwanee portion of the Floridan Aquifer, and
> layer 3 simulating the Avon Park Formation portion of the Floridan
> Aquifer. The surficial aquifer is defined to be approximately 35 ft
> thick, while the Upper Floridan is a total of 900 ft thick and is
> divided into 500 ft in layer 2 and 400 ft in layer 3. The aquifer
> layers are separated by semiconfining zones, which allow for vertical
> interchange between the layers (USGS, 1989).
>
> Due to the Karst geology present in this area, the area's ground water
> and surface water are closely interconnected, which leads to major
> concerns over the present and projected increases in pumping
> throughout the area. Over- pumping of water from aquifer systems can
> cause both direct and indirect prob- lems. Direct effects include
> lowering of the potentiometric surface of the aquifer, lowering the
> water table of the shallow aquifer, lowering of the amount of water
> available for surface runoff, deterioration of water quality, and
> increased pump- ing costs (Drew and Hotzl, 1999). An example of water
> quality deterioration is the potential for seawater intrusion.

> One of the most serious effects observed in the NTB area has been the
> decline of ground water levels, which have dropped in some areas as
> much as 20 ft between the 1940s and 1990s (SWFWMD, 1993). The decline

> water bodies. In the NTB area there is currently concern over the
> effect of lowered water levels on lakes, wetlands, springs, and
> reduced stream flow in river systems caused by overpumping in the
> area. The effect of pumping on the surface water bodies is dependent
> on a variety of factors. These include

-   the distance between the pumping well and the lake,

-   the rate and duration of pumping,

-   geologic and hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer,

-   vertical permeability and thickness of the confining beds,

-   difference in head established between the deeper aquifer and the
    > shallow water-table aquifer, and

-   the degree of interconnection between the lake bottoms and the
    > under- lying unconsolidated sediments and the limestone (Stewart,
    > 1968).

> Since there are hundreds of lakes and wetlands dispersed throughout
> the NTB area, many of which are near the major pumping centers, the
> area's surface water bodies have been greatly affected (SWFWMD, 1993).

> **Data Collection and Model Input**
>
> The NTB model is an example of a regional model that includes 11 well
> fields in a five-county region that covers a total of 1500 square
> miles (SWF- WMD, 1993). The NTB model takes advantage of the
> flexibility allowed by MODFLOW in having variable spacing with
> grid-cell areas ranging from
>
> 0.25 to 1 square mile. This variable spacing was selected to allow for
> smaller grid cells around areas of high ground water use and areas
> with well-defined hydrogeological information. The grid area includes
> 62 rows and 69 columns that are bounded by constant-head boundaries,
> no-flow boundaries, and general head boundaries.
>
> Observation data were used to assess both spatial and temporal agree-
> ment of the models. For temporal comparisons, all available data
> points were compared; but for spatial comparisons, 17 locations were
> selected as representative samples across the region (Fig. 8--30).
> These locations were selected to be representative of both aquifer
> levels as well as to be widely distributed across the grid. The three
> clusters of wells near Eldridge Wilde and Morris Bridge well fields
> were selected to study the model's ability to simulate the local
> impacts around large-volume pumping centers.
>
> Ground water models require input information to define the hydrogeo-
> logic and hydrogeochemical conditions of the area. The input
> information is categorized into three areas: geologic, physical and
> chemical parameters, and

> external stress parameters. The geologic inputs outline the location
> of the boundaries and thickness of geologic units in the model. The
> external stresses include inputs on pumping, injection, and recharge.
> The physical and chemical parameter inputs define the hydraulic
> conductivity, porosity, transmissivity, and evapotranspiration of each
> grid cell. The recharge value is based on land use, average rainfall
> in subbasins, and a recharge coefficient predetermined by the water
> district. Changes in growth and development require temporal updating
> of parameters such as pumping, recharge, and evapotranspiration. It is
> impor- tant to note that model input parameters are never completely
> defined; there is always associated uncertainty of sampling and
> interpolation error (Zheng and Bennett, 1995). The calibrated SWFWMD
> 1993 model was used as the starting point for this study. The
> calibrated model provided all initial estimates of trans- missivity,
> hydraulic conductivity, storage, leakage, recharge, and evapotranspi-
> ration. These values are based on model data sets collected from the
> tricounty well-field model and the Pasco County water resources model
> (Fretwell, 1988) and on field data collected by the NTB project and
> other investigators.
>
> **GMS and Modflow**
>
> The Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) model is a robust and compre-
> hensive ground water modeling package that provides tools for every
> phase of a ground water simulation, including site description, model
> development, postprocessing, calibration, and visualization. Modeling
> with GMS allows
>
> the user variation and flexibility in graphical output. GMS includes a
> sophis- ticated multilayer MODFLOW interface that allows models to be
> defined and edited at the conceptual model level or on a cell-by-cell
> basis at the grid level. MODFLOW is one of the most widely used flow
> models and consists of a main program and a series of independent
> subroutines grouped into modules, or packages. Each package deals with
> a specific feature of the hydrologic system, such as flow from rivers,
> recharge, or transmissivity. The division of the program into packages
> allows the user to analyze the specific hydrologic features of the
> model independently.
>
> MODFLOW is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground water flow
> model, developed for the USGS by McDonald and Harbaugh (1988). MODFLOW
> is based on solving the following partial differential equation for
> head in three-dimensional movement of ground water of constant density
> through porous media:
>
> [0]{.underline} a*K~xx~* [0*h*]{.underline} b + [0]{.underline}
> a*K~yy~* [0*h*]{.underline} b + [0]{.underline} a*K~zz~*
> [0*h*]{.underline} b - *W* = *S~s~* [0*h*]{.underline}, (8--64)
>
> 0*x* 0*x* 0*y* 0*y* 0*z* 0*z* 0*t*
>
> where *K~xx~*, *K~yy~*, and *K~zz~* are defined as the hydraulic
> conductivity along the coordinate axis, *h* represents the
> potentiometric head, *W* is the volumetric flux per unit volume being
> pumped, *S~s~* is the specific storage of the aquifer, and *t* is the
> time.
>
> MODFLOW uses a block-centered finite-difference grid approach in which
> flux boundaries are always located at the edge of the block (Anderson
> and Woessner, 1992). The model can handle unconfined or confined
> systems, external stresses such as wells, areal recharge,
> evapotranspiration, flow to drains, and flow through rivers. It is
> considered the standard flow model in the field and is often linked
> with other contaminant transport models to sim- ulate movement of
> chemicals in the subsurface. The model is designed so that it can be
> modified easily and executed on a variety of computers, and it is
> efficient to use with graphical programs such as GMS (Bedient et al.,
> 1999).
>
> **Case Study Results**
>
> In order to update the SWFWMD's model, which was based upon data from
> 1993, the MODFLOW model needed to be restructured using data through
> 1998. Simulations were performed using various combinations of
> pumping, recharge, transmissivity, and evapotranspiration input files.
> Results were analyzed for both temporal and spatial agreement.
> Recharge was a main parameter not known with significant accuracy due
> to lack of necessary hydrogeologic data, changes in land use, rainfall
> pattern variation, and the fact that some overprediction was observed
> in the original 1993 model runs. In addition, recharge was evaluated
> by the SWFWMD on an annual basis, which masked fluctuations that
> occurred on a monthly basis. Thus, recharge was altered to account for
> the variability in data; several recharge data sets were considered,
> which utilized the current annual average recharge from

> observation stations and 40 representative time steps, were performed
> for the period from 1989--1998. The 70% recharge simulation, as shown

> results indi- cated water levels in the aquifer would remain on
> average within 0.1 ft of the 1999 water levels that were estimated by
> the district (SWFMWD, 1993). However, both the 1999 and the 2010 water
> levels averaged 6.8 ft lower than historic levels. Since the predicted
> levels were generally much lower than historic levels, continued
> damage to lakes, wetlands, and the aquifers is expected. Thus, some
> reduction in pumpage is clearly needed.
>
> Future conditions were also projected with reduced pumping rates in
> the aquifer. When testing the effect of reduced pumping using the 2010
> Reduced Pumpage simulation, the model results indicated water levels
> increasing at the stations located near pumping fields. These 2010
> water levels had an average increase of 3.25 ft from estimated 1999
> water levels, were much closer to historic levels than the current
> projections, and were on an average 3.4 ft lower than historic levels.
> Although some locations did not meet the historic levels, they did
> improve on the current conditions, which should decrease the magnitude
> of impacts.

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Ground water hydrology is introduced and reviewed in this chapter.
> Ground water flow according to Darcy's law is described, and the
> general flow equations are de- rived for confined and unconfined
> aquifers. The theory of streamlines and equipo- tential lines is
> presented to explain flow-net concepts. Dupuit flow and seepage are
> shown for unconfined aquifers along with equations for steady radial
> flow to a well for single-well and multiple-well systems. The concept
> of superposition is presented and can be used for handling complex
> flow fields.
>
> Theis's method for unsteady well hydraulics is derived in theory and
> several applications are included; it forms the modern basis for
> aquifer pump tests. The simpler Cooper--Jacob method can be used to
> solve the unsteady-flow equation un- der certain conditions. Finally,
> radial flow in a leaky aquifer is presented in theory and example.
> Slug tests are used to determine aquifer properties using a single
> well, whereas pump tests require more than one well.
>
> Ground water modeling techniques include both analytical and numerical
> solu- tions to the governing flow equations. Usually,
> finite-difference methods for steady- state or transient flow are
> used, especially where heterogeneous properties exist. One of the most
> popular computer models for ground water flow is MODFLOW. It has
> become the model of choice for any ground water study of regional
> hydrogeology or contaminant transport. When used along with MODPATH to
> predict flow direc- tions and streamlines, it can represent any
> layered aquifer system along with complex boundary and initial
> conditions for a site. A case study using MODFLOW applied to an
> aquifer in Florida is described in detail to provide a useful level of
> coverage for the beginning student or professional. Ground water
> modeling case studies can be found in the literature and in Anderson
> and Woessner (1992), Bedient et al. (1999), Charbeneau (2000), and
> Todd and Mays (2000).

> **PROBLEMS**

1.  Compute the Darcy velocity and seepage velocity for water flowing
    through a sand column with the following characteristics:

> *K* = 10 ^-4^ cm/s,
>
> *dh*\>*dl* = 0.01, area = 75 cm^2^,
>
> *n* = 0.30.

2.  The average water-table elevation has dropped 4 ft due to the
    removal of 100,000 ac-ft from an unconfined aquifer over an area of
    75 mi^2^. Determine the storage coefficient for the aquifer.

3.  A confined aquifer is 50 m thick and 0.5 km wide. Two observation
    wells are located 1.5 km apart in the direction of flow. Head in
    well 1 is 50.0 m and in well 2 is 42 m. Hydraulic conductivity *K*
    is 0.7 m/day.

    a.  What is the total daily flow of water through the aquifer?

    b.  What is the height *z* of the piezometric surface 0.5 km from
        > well 1 and 0.9 km from well 2?

4.  A well with a diameter of 18 in. penetrates an unconfined aquifer
    that is 100 ft thick. Two observation wells are located at 100 ft
    and 235 ft from the well, and the measured drawdowns are 22.2 ft and
    21 ft, respectively. Flow is steady and the hydraulic conductivity
    is 1400 gpd/ft^2^. What is the steady-state rate of discharge from
    the well?

5.  Two piezometers are located 1200 ft apart with the bottom located at
    depths of 50 ft and 350 ft, respectively, in a 400-ft-thick
    unconfined aquifer. The depth to the water table is 50 ft in the
    deeper piezometer and 40 ft in the shallow one. Assume that
    hydraulic conductivity is 0.0002 ft/s.

    a.  Use the Dupuit equation to calculate the height of the water
        > table midway between the piezometers.

    b.  Find the flow rate per unit thickness for a section midway
        > between the wells.

6.  In a fully penetrating well, the equilibrium drawdown is 30 ft
    measured at *r* = 100 ft from the well, which pumps at a rate of 20
    gpm. The aquifer is un- confined with *K* = 30 ft/day, and the
    saturated thickness is 100 ft. What is the steady-state drawdown at
    the well (*r* = 0.5 ft) for this aquifer?

7.  A soil sample 6 in. in diameter and 1 ft long is placed in a
    falling-head per- meameter. The falling-head tube diameter is 1 in.
    and the initial head is 8 in. The head falls 1 in. over a 2-hr
    period. Calculate the hydraulic conductivity.

8.  A constant-head permeameter containing very fine-grained sand has a
    length of 12 cm and a cross-sectional area of 30 cm^2^. With a head
    of 10 cm, a total of 100 ml of water is collected in 30 min. Find
    the hydraulic conductivity.

9.  Bull Creek flows through and completely penetrates a confined
    aquifer 10 ft thick, as shown in Figure P8--9. The flow is reduced
    in the stream by 16 cfs between two gaging stations located 4 miles
    apart along the creek. On the west side of the creek, the
    piezometric contours parallel the bank and slope toward Bull Creek
    at *S* = 0.0004 ft/ft. The piezometric contours on the east side of
    the creek slope away from the channel at a slope of 0.0006 ft/ft.
    Using Darcy's law and the continuity equation, compute the
    transmissivity of the aquifer along this section of Bull Creek. Note
    that the flow area to the creek is 15 ft thick and 4 miles wide.

10. Three geologic formations overlie one another with the
    > characteristics listed below. A constant-velocity vertical flow
    > field exists across the three forma- tions. The hydraulic head is
    > 75 ft at the top of the formations and 59 ft at the bottom, with a
    > datum located at the bottom of the three units. Calculate the
    > hydraulic head at the two internal boundaries.

> *b*~1~ = 20 ft, *K*~1~ = 20 ft/day,
>
> *b*~2~ = 10 ft, *K*~2~ = 0.20 ft/day,
>
> *b*~3~ = 25 ft, *K*~3~ = 0.030 ft/day.

11. Two wells are located 100 m apart in a confined aquifer with a
    > transmissivity

> *T* = 2 . 10 ^-4^ m^2^/s and storativity *S* = 7 . 10 ^-5^. One well
> to the west is pumped
>
> at a rate of 6.6 m^3^/hr and the other to the east at a rate of 10.0
> m^3^/hr. Plot draw- down as a function of distance along the line
> joining the wells at 1 hr after the pumping starts.

12. At a waste site, a Hvorslev slug test was performed in a confined
    > aquifer with a piezometer intake length of 20 ft and a radius of 1
    > in. The radius of the rod was 0.68 in. The following recovery data
    > for the well were observed. Given that the static water level is
    > 7.58 ft and *H*~0~ = 6.88 ft, calculate the hydraulic
    > conductivity.

16. Drawdown was observed in a well located 100 ft from a pumping well
    that was pumped at a rate of 1.11 cfs (498 gpm) for a 30-hr period.
    Use the Cooper--Jacob method to compute *T* and *S* for this
    aquifer.

17. Repeat Problem 8.16 using the Theis method.

18. Refer to Figure 8--9(b), which shows a flow net under a dam section.
    > Note the values of head for the two sides of the dam, and compute
    > the seepage or flow rate through the dam if the dam is 120 ft long
    > with *K* = 20 ft/day.

19. A landfill liner is laid at elevation 50 ft msl (mean sea level) on
    > top of a good clay unit. A clean sand unit extends from elevation
    > 50 ft to elevation 75 ft, and another clay unit extends up to the
    > surface, located at elevation 100 ft. The landfill can be
    > represented by a square with length of 500 ft on a side and a
    > vertical depth of 50 ft from the surface. The landfill has a
    > 3-ft-thick clay liner with *K* = 10 ^-7^ cm/s around the sides and
    > bottom, as shown in Figure P8--19. The regional ground water level
    > for the confined sand (*K* = 10 ^-2^ cm/s) is located at a depth
    > of 10 ft below the surface, or elevation = 90 ft.

20. Repeat Problem 8.19 if the clean sand unit extends below the
    > landfill to an elevation of 25 ft msl. The clay liner exists
    > around and on the bottom of the landfill. Consider Darcy's law
    > across both the sides and bottom of the clay liner.

21. A well located at *x* = 0, *y* = 0 injects water into an aquifer at
    > *Q* = 1.0 cfs, and observation wells are located along the
    > *x*-axis at *x* = 10, 50, 150, and 300 ft away from the injection
    > well. The confined aquifer with thickness of 10 ft has *T* = 3200
    > sq ft/day and *S* = 0.005. The injection is affected by the
    > presence of a linear river located at *x* = 300 ft east of the
    > injection well. Compute the head buildup along the *x*-axis at the
    > observation-well locations after 6 hr of injection.

22. Repeat Dupuit Example 8--3 for the case where net recharge *W* = 10
    > cm/yr. Repeat the example for the case where *W* = 0.

23. Use the Theis-method equations to characterize the behavior of a
    con- fined aquifer that is homogeneous and isotropic with *T* = 500
    m^2^/day and *S* = 1 × 10 ^-5^. A single well is pumped at 2500
    m^3^/day.

    a.  Compute the drawdown 75 m away from the well at *t* = 1, 10,
        > 100, 1000, and 10,000 minutes after pumping began.

    b.  Compute the drawdown after 1.0 day of pumping at locations

> *r* = 2, 5, 10, 50, 200, and 1000 m from the pumping well.

24. A well at a distance *d* from an impermeable boundary pumps at a
    flow rate *Q*. The head and any point (*x, y*) is given by the
    following equation:

> *h*(*x*, *y*) *Q*

2p*T*

> \[ln(*r*~1~

*r*~2~)\] + *C*,

> where *C* is a constant, *r*~1~ is the straight-line distance from the
> well to the point (*x, y*), and *r*~2~ is the distance from the image
> well to the point (*x*, *y*). The *y*-axis lies along the impermeable
> boundary. Use Darcy's law to show that the flow across the boundary
> (*y*-axis) is indeed zero.

25. A fully penetrating well pumps from a confined aquifer of thickness
    20 m and *K* = 10 m/day. The radius of the well is 0.25 m and the
    recorded pump rate in the well is 100 m^3^/day at steady state.
    Assume that the radius of influence of the well is 1250 m. Compute
    the drawdown at the well if it is located 100 m from an impermeable
    boundary (see Problem 8.24).

## Design Applications in Hydrology

### ---By James F. Thompson

![](./images/media/image189.png)

> Open channel improvements in Houston, Texas.

**9.1**

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> **560**
>
> This chapter addresses many fundamental design applications in
> hydrology that are routinely used in engineering and related analyses.
> The basic design ele- ments of drainage collection systems for
> urbanized areas are presented along with the applications of synthetic
> design storms used in common design and analysis situations. Culvert
> design is presented at a fundamental level, and ap- plications of
> detention basins for peak runoff control are also discussed as ap-
> plied to typical urban developments and improvement projects. Design
> issues applied in floodplain management for the purposes of flood
> damage reduction are discussed, along with an example of various
> stages of applications.
>
> Detailed examples of design applications are presented in this
> chapter, and much of the discussion builds upon other topics in
> hydrology presented in other chapters. Design approaches commonly used
> in engineering applications are described, employing conventional
> hand-calculation methods as well as com- puter modeling using HEC-HMS,
> HEC-RAS, and other software programs.
>
> Typically, a drainage design is initiated based upon a need either for
> facilitat- ing drainage of a particular project area or for improved
> drainage as would be required to address the flood reduction of a
> particular area. Five steps are normally taken in the design of
> drainage collection systems:

1.  Define the drainage areas serving the project area.

2.  Determine the hydrologic response and runoff from these drainage
    areas, given a particular design or actual storm event.

3.  Design the stormwater conveyance conduits.

4.  Analyze the effects of increased stormwater quantity, if any.

5.  Mitigate any project negative effects.

> Another component commonly included in design relates to stormwa- ter
> quality. Many references address the issue of the management of runoff
> quality. Local or regional jurisdictions usually control the design
> parameters and criteria to be employed for a particular collection
> system.
>
> A typical urban stormwater system consists of streets constructed with
> curbs, gutters, inlets, and roadside ditches; underground storm
> sewers; and open outfall channels such as streams, bayous, and rivers
> receiving runoff. In designing a system, the first basic step is to
> determine the contributing drainage areas to the system, so that the
> runoff may be estimated. This en- tails the development of a drainage
> area map based upon the topography of the project area. Figure 9--1
> illustrates a typical urban setting, upon which a drainage area map
> has been developed to define the contributing drainage areas to storm
> sewer system junctions.
>
> More explicit maps are often prepared delineating the individual
> drain- age areas based upon inlet placement. The drainage area map
> illustrates a simplified layout to be used for design of the storm
> sewer system. Inlet design and placement are critical and are
> discussed later in this chapter. In Figure 9--1, each individual
> drainage area drains to the associated manhole junction (drainage area
> A9 to manhole junction MH-A9, and so on).
>
> The development of a proper drainage area map is a fundamental build-
> ing block of any urban stormwater system. Existing topographic maps
> and other map sources illustrating relative topographic contours may
> be used to develop the map. More advanced methods may be employed,
> such as aerial photography, which is in turn used to develop a digital
> elevation model (DEM). Further developments in remote sensing
> techniques are being applied today, such as light detection and
> ranging (LIDAR), which is used to produce very accurate
> three-dimensional digital maps for use in the development of drainage
> area boundaries. Regardless of the source, it is imperative that the
> drainage area map reflect the true pattern of the surface flow of
> rainfall runoff. Once these patterns and contributing drainage areas
> are known, the quantity of storm water runoff may be determined.
> Chapter 10 presents more details on topographic analysis using
> geographical information systems (GIS).

> and storage ele- ments in the form of detention basins. The basic
> principles of establishing synthetic storms entails the creation of a

> Collection systems are designed to convey a particular design storm

> agency. Some entities (i.e., city, county, and state agencies) require
> more stringent standard design capacities for local collection systems
> than do others. The variety of design events utilized for various
> applications is extensive. In some locations, a 2-yr design storm is
> suitable for local collector systems, whereas in others, established
> criteria may require that a larger design storm event be managed by
> the collection system, such as a 10-yr design storm. For spe- cial

> **Rational Method as Applied to Design**
>
> The most commonly used method for determining peak flow rates from a
> given project drainage area is the rational method using the formula
>
> *Q* = (*CA*) . *i* (9--1)
>
> where *Q* is the peak runoff flow in cfs, *C* is the dimensionless
> runoff coeffi- cient, *A* is the drainage area in acres, and *i* is
> the rainfall intensity in inches per hour. The rational method is
> simplistic in that it relies on the basic phys- ical characteristic of
> a drainage area (i.e., size and runoff coefficient) multi- plied by a
> rainfall intensity as based upon the design event being considered.
> The runoff coefficient, *C*, varies dramatically based upon the
> developed state of the drainage area. Table 6--6 lists commonly
> utilized runoff coefficients. Section 6.2 presents more details on the
> rational method.
>
> The rainfall intensity is a function of the return frequency or design
> event and the time of concentration (*Tc*). *Tc* is normally thought
> of as the equilibrium time for rainfall at the most remote part of the
> drainage area to contribute flow at the outlet or design point---in
> other words, how many minutes it takes for a water particle to travel
> the longest distance within a contributing drainage area

> being considered. The basic fundamental assumption of *Tc* in the
> rational method is that the time to peak, *Tp*, is equal to *Tc* and
> that the runoff hydro- graph for a project area has a simplified
> relationship, as shown in Figure 9--3.
>
> A critical function in the rational formula is the rainfall intensity,
> *i.* While specific rainfall intensities can be used for a given
> project area, it is common to use established
> intensity--duration--frequency (IDF) curves. Using sources relating
> total rainfall depth to a rainfall duration period (i.e., 5- to
> 60-minute; and 6-, 12-, and 24-hour, and so on), such as Technical
> Paper No. 40 and Technical Memorandum Hydro 35 from the National
> Weather Service, we may develop IDF curves which relate *Tc*, the
> design event or frequency, and the runoff intensity measured in inches
> per hour. Most major municipalities and state entities have IDF
> curves, or formulas used to create specific IDF curves, readily
> available for use. Furthermore, these same entities typically specify
> the design event to be utilized on a given project. Typical IDF curves
> are illustrated in Figure 9--4.

> **Design of Conveyance Conduits**
>
> Once a design storm is created in compliance with the maximum storm
> fre- quency, the peak flow of that storm can be used to design an

> with drainage collection systems: closed conduits and open channels.
> Closed conduits include all types of sewer systems, including round

> conduits. Drainage-system open channels come in all sizes, from small
> drain- age swales that are only barely noticeable to major open
> channels. Major open channels commonly encountered in floodplain
> management are discussed, from a design standpoint, later in this
> chapter. For drainage collection systems, the most common form of open
> channel encountered is the ordinary roadside ditch. Roadside ditches,
> like closed conduits, come in all sizes.
>
> The actual design of urban storm sewers and open channels, or con-
> duits, is a process of sizing the conveyance conduit to facilitate the
> estimated peak flow rate at that point in the system, considering the
> upstream drainage area(s). In using the rational method, as the
> drainage areas are summed moving downstream along the new or proposed
> storm drainage conduit, *Tc* is naturally increased. This reflects the
> dampening or attenuation of the storm flood wave as it propagates
> downstream through the conduits. To size the conduits themselves, it
> is common to use Manning's equation,

> In parallel with the sizing of the conduits, the relative position of

> represents the locus of elevations to which the stormwater would rise
> if open to atmospheric pressure, such as within piezometer tubes; it
> can be used to evaluate the adequacy of the de- sign and identify
> areas of potential surface flooding. The difference in eleva- tion of
> the water surface in successive conduit reaches reflects the friction
> and other minor losses in the conduits due to drops and bends,
> assuming gradually varied flow conditions. If the conduit has a slope
> equal to the fric- tion slope, then the HGL will be parallel to the
> conduit. Considering Equa- tion (9--3), the conduit slope, *S*, is
> equal to the friction loss, *h~f~*, divided by the length of conduit,
> *L*, in full-flow conditions, ignoring minor losses. Solving for
> *h~f~*, Equation (9--4) represents Manning's equation as utilized for

> 9--5 illustrates the relationship between the HGL, the EGL, and a
> conduit (in this case a storm sewer pipe). Notice that if the starting

> the soffit of the conduit itself, then the conduit may be flowing
> partially full. Conversely, if the outlet is fully submerged, then the
> conduit will be under pressure, at least at the outlet, assuming that

> **EXAMPLE 9--1**
>
> **STORM SEWER COLLECTION SYSTEM DESIGN**
>
> Figure 9--1 shows an actual drainage area map of a project area and
> urban storm sewer layout. Figure 9--4 shows the applicable IDF curves
> for this region, and Equation (9--2) provides a useful method for
> calculating the intensity values. The sizing of conduits for this
> storm sewer can be com- pleted with a typical storm sewer design
> spreadsheet, as shown in Table E9--1(a). Complete the unfinished lines
> (shaded cells) of this spreadsheet (Manhole A6 to A3) using the data
> provided in the table and finish cal- culating the HGL elevations up
> to Manhole A9 in column 24 of the table. This will determine the
> correct size of each conduit needed to accom- modate a given design
> storm and will calculate the HGL or water surface profile of the
> system. Given that this is a new storm sewer system in an existing
> urban area, many of the conduit characteristics are set in order to
> avoid conflicts with existing utilities. In the completion of this
> example, only the conduit size is to be determined as a design
> variable based on the other fixed characteristics (U/S and D/S
> elevations, lengths, and slopes). A minimum of 3 ft/sec shall be used
> in the storm sewer, assuming full-flow conditions in order to maintain
> a minimum self-cleaning velocity in the sewers. Use standard
> reinforced concrete pipe sizes in the design (0.5-ft diameter
> increments in size). Ignore minor losses of manholes.

>
> **SOLUTION**
>
> Once the fundamentals of the above equations are understood, the
> actual de- sign development is rather straightforward. Referencing
> back to Figure 9--1 as a fundamental basis for the design, proceed
> from upstream to downstream in the calculations of the storm sewer
> sizing. Visualize the connectivity of the system. Line A goes from the
> Outlet to Manhole A9. Line B connects to Line A at Manhole A1 and
> continues up to Manhole B3. The following steps are worked for every
> conduit reach (a conduit reach being from one manhole junc- tion to a
> connecting manhole junction) and apply to all lines in the
> spreadsheet.

1.  Multiply the given *C* coefficient and contributing drainage area
    > for the receiving upstream manhole location. Tabulate the result
    > in column 6.

2.  Sum the combined *C* \* *A* values from the rational method in col-
    > umn 7, thus providing a weighted *C* \* *A* value to account for
    > dif- ferent *C* values along the project route.

> *Note:* For the last row (reach A1 to Outlet), add the upstream
> reaches in Line A and B together for the Total Drainage Area and Sum
> *C* \* *A* (include its own drainage area, 5.42).

3.  Determine the various intensity values from IDF curves or the re-
    > lated intensity formula using the determined *Tc* (in this
    > example, the established *Tc*) and tabulate in column 10.

> *Note:* The Design Storm is a 2-yr, 24-hr event, as stated at the top
> of the spreadsheet.

4.  Calculate the flow rates, *Q*, for each design reach in column 11
    > us- ing Equation (9--1).

5.  At this point the conduit can be sized accordingly. A roughness of

> 0.013 is used, as the conduit shall be reinforced concrete pipe (see
> column 21). In this example, all conduits shall be round pipe and the
> conduit span and rise dimensions (columns 14 and 15) are the same.
> Since the geometry of the storm sewer system is fixed, as described
> above, the design entails finding a suitable pipe size that will meet
> flow and velocity criteria. Two means can be used at this stage to
> design the storm sewer size. The first method can entail the rear-
> rangement of Equation (9--3) to explicitly find the pipe diameter in
> feet, since all other variables are known. Once this is done, the
> nearest larger standard pipe size can be used. The second method is
> simply by trial and error in the spreadsheet (try a size, see if it
> works, and adjust if needed). Both methods, using the explicit cal-
> culation of the conduit size or trial and error, work suitably well.
>
> Remember, there are two basic checks to make when designing every
> conduit size:

(a) Is the capacity of the sewer reach greater than or equal to the
    actual flow (column 22 compared to 11)?

(b) Does the actual velocity of the sewer reach meet or exceed the mini-
    mum 3 ft/sec requirement?

> The design intent is to use the smallest standard-sized reinforced
> concrete pipe that will meet these criteria, because this will provide
> the most cost benefit. In addition, if a conduit is too large for a
> given flow, the actual velocity of the flow in the sewer will be too
> low.

1.  Once the pipeline diameter is determined, use the usual form of
    > Manning's equation \[Eq. (9--3)\] to calculate flow capacity for
    > the designed conduit (column 22). Dividing the actual flow
    > (column 11) by the designed conduit area (column 17) gives the
    > actual velocity in the conduit, assuming full-flow conditions.

2.  After the conduits are sized, it is common then to calculate the HGL
    > or water surface profile of the system. We do so by calcu- lating
    > the friction loss in each storm sewer reach and then add- ing
    > those together, on a reach-by-reach basis, starting at the most
    > downstream known water surface location---in this case, the
    > outlet. Unlike the storm sewer system itself, which is designed
    > from up- stream to downstream, the HGL is determined from
    > downstream to upstream. Minor losses, including manhole junction
    > losses, can be employed for a more accurate HGL computation, but
    > in many instances, and in this example, the minor losses are
    > ignored.

> In closed conduit systems, the friction loss in each reach can be
> found with Equation (9--4). The HGL is formed by adding those losses,
> on a reach- by-reach basis, to the starting water surface elevation at
> the outlet---hence the importance of defining a proper starting water
> surface elevation at the outlet (31.00 ft in this example---see the
> top of the spreadsheet). Given the starting tailwater elevation
> relative to the storm sewers, the sewers are flowing full in this
> example, and the friction loss is computed in a straightforward
> manner, as described above.
>
> In completing the design as stipulated above (using the smallest
> standard- sized reinforced concrete pipe, in half-foot increments,
> that has sufficient ca- pacity and yields at least the minimum
> full-flow velocity required), the design solution for the reaches'
> left bank is tabulated in Table E9--1(b). A profile plot of the storm
> sewer design for Line A is included in Figure 9--7, and im- portant
> considerations of overland flow are discussed following this example.

> The overall way a storm sewer design works hand-in-hand with surface
> drainage features is critical to the performance of the combined
> subsurface and surface drainage components (i.e., the underground
> conduits and the above- ground drainage mechanisms like the surface
> streets). Figure 9--7 is a profile plot of the design results of Line
> A in Example 9--1. Notice that the HGL is suitably below the natural
> ground and street gutter lines, thus indicating that surface flooding
> is not anticipated for that particular design event, assuming the
> inlets are designed adequately, as discussed later in this chapter.
> Also notice that the surface streets are graded to allow for an
> overland flow path of stormwater, in an extreme storm event that would
> exceed the designed capacity of the storm sewer system, to flow to the
> receiving outfall, in this case a bayou, in a cascading fashion over
> the street profile grade line (PGL) high points. Referring both to
> Figures 9--6 and 9--7 gives a visual representation of the
> relationships between the storm sewer design, the position of the HGL
> of the sewer system, and the design of the overland flow mechanisms
> such as the surface streets.
>
> In designing storm sewer systems, it is important to consider the
> effect of the downstream starting water surface elevation at the
> outlet or outfall. The water surface elevation chosen for the outlet
> dictates the regional storm's effect on HGL height in the local
> system. This elevation must have some rela- tion and may be used as
> provided by other studies and analyses or as deter- mined from
> approximations, if acceptable, using normal depth calculations within
> the outlet receiving channel. In many instances, the design criterion
> allows for simplified assumptions pertaining to starting water surface
> eleva- tions at the outlet for the purposes of computing the HGL along
> a designed storm sewer system. This may be the soffit (top or crown)
> of the last reach of pipe at the outlet or even perhaps some arbitrary
> elevation as prescribed by a governing flood control agency. In any
> case, the HGL is computed upstream
>
> throughout the storm sewer system to detect instances where
> significant head loss may exist. Increasing the size of the conduit
> increases the hydraulic radius of the conduit, thereby reducing the
> friction loss and the slope of the HGL. In cases where certain HGL
> criteria must be met, a trial-and-error type of approach is often
> exercised to finalize a design that satisfies the design intent.
>
> **Minor Losses in Storm Sewers**
>
> Manhole and junction losses as well as bend losses may be considered
> in the development of the HGL profile. In some cases, these losses are
> considered minor and insignificant; in other cases, especially where
> relative velocities are rather high, the losses may be considered
> significant and therefore added to the conduit friction losses at the
> junctions. Equation (9--6) represents the equation for the calculation
> of manhole/junction losses. Notice the primary influencing parameter
> in these equations is the velocity term. When the velocity is rather
> low, these losses are indeed very minor (thousandths of a foot);
> however, they do add up and can exacerbate a potential flooding
> problem due to high-HGL problems, such as illustrated in Figure 9--6.
> In general, it is desirable to keep the minimum velocities within
> conduits above 3 feet per second. Maximum veloci- ties should not
> exceed 8 feet per second without due consideration of the use of
> energy-dissipation features to control the effects of high velocities
> such as ero- sion. Again, local design guidelines generally dictate
> this controlling criterion.
>
> In some design circumstances, the friction coefficient, *n*, is used
> to consider the minor losses anticipated. In Example 9--1, had the
> friction coef- ficient been 0.011, a reasonable *n*-value found in
> laboratory case studies, in lieu of the used 0.013 value, the total
> friction loss would have been reduced over 1.5 ft throughout the
> entire Line A system. Hence the *n*-value can be used to aid the
> overall design in terms of trying to more accurately estimate the
> total loss through the system when minor losses (bends, manhole junc-
> tions, and inlet losses) are ignored.
>
> When manhole junction losses are desired to be considered, we may use
> the equation

*h~j~* = *K~j~* a *V*

b (9--6)

> where *h~j~* is the manhole/junction loss without a curved deflector
> (ft), *V* is the velocity through the manhole in ft/sec, *g* =
> gravitational constant (32.2 ft/sec^2^), and *K~j~* is as shown in
> Figure 9--8.
>
> **Inlets Used with Storm Sewers**
>
> Equally important as the design of the conduits is the design of
> inlets and other stormwater capture facilities. An inlet is simply a
> stormwater capture feature that physically receives flow from overland
> sheet flow or more channelized flow such as within a gutter, and the
> importance of properly sized inlets cannot be overstated. After all,
> the conduit system may be sized adequately for a certain design event,

> **DESIGN OF CULVERTS**
>
> **Fundamentals of Culverts**
>
> Culverts are commonly referred to as those conveyance conduits
> constructed within embankments for the purposes of supporting a
> roadway, a railroad, or for the particular functionality of the
> embankment itself, such as would be the case in a levee. Culverts are
> different than storm sewers in that they are typically much shorter
> (although there are cases of long-span culverts) and are exposed at
> both ends to accommodate unobstructed inflow and outflow of storm
> water. The simple culvert crossing of a street connecting two road-
> side ditches is one of the most common culvert applications readily
> identified. Culvert crossings, as they are commonly known, come in all
> shapes and sizes. A variety of materials are often used in culvert
> construction, in a variety of shapes, such as circular, box, and
> elliptical. As needed to convey a given amount of stormwater flow,
> given particular depth requirements, multiple barrels of culverts may
> be used at a single location. While appearing simple, culvert behavior
> and culvert design are deceptively complex.
>
> Referring to Figure 9--10, the factors that affect culvert design
> include the headwater (*HW*), the tailwater (*TW*), the length (*L*),
> the size or diameter (*D*), the slope (*S*), and the friction factor
> (*n*). Many other factors also affect the performance of culverts,
> such as the inlet and outlet geometry, which would include the use of
> headwalls and even the shape of the culvert edges. The basic driving
> culvert design parameter is considered to be the allowable headwater
> depth. After all, the intent of a culvert is to allow stormwater to
> pass through an embankment at a planned rate, which relates to an
> allowable headwater depth on the upstream side of the culvert, given
> an established

> tailwater condition downstream of the culvert. Looking at Figure
> 9--10, the simple balanced equation for comparing the water surface
> elevations on both sides of the culvert is
>
> *HW* + *LS* = *TW* + *H* (9--9)
>
> where *HW* is the upstream headwater at the inlet of the culvert, *LS*
> is the product of the length multiplied by the slope of the culvert,
> *TW* is the down- stream tailwater at the outlet of the culvert, and
> *H* is the total head loss through the culvert, as described in
> further detail below.
>
> Culverts are generally divided into two classifications: **inlet
> controlled** or **outlet controlled**. Inlet-controlled culverts are
> governed by the inlet of the culvert, and the discharge through the
> culvert is predominately affected by the culvert entrance. In a
> simplistic sense, inlet control exists when the discharge through the
> culvert itself can be at a greater rate than what is capable of
> entering into the culvert at the inlet. Inlet-controlled culverts are
> not affected so much by the internal culvert characteristics, such as
> rough- ness and length, as by the headwater depth, entrance geometry
> and configu- ration, and type of inlet edge. Culverts do not flow full
> throughout their entire length under inlet control conditions, and
> generally flows are super- critical in the culverts. If the culvert
> application is in an environment of relatively steep slope, inlet
> control is more likely. Figure 9--11 illustrates an example of
> inlet-control conditions for a culvert; other inlet-control flow
> conditions exist as well (see reference material for a more detailed
> description of other flow conditions).
>
> Inlet control can be somewhat involved in terms of the calculations
> employed due to the partially full-flow conditions of the culvert.
> Many publications document the behavior of culvert conditions in a
> variety of applications. As would be typical, inlet-control conditions
> require the use of tables, charts, nomographs, or other available
> reference materials from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or
> other sources that will aid the designer in defining the behavior of
> the culvert in terms of hydraulic perfor- mance based upon extensive
> research. The design of inlet-controlled culverts can be complex for
> the reasons stated above, and in lieu of using the described published
> culvert behavior tables, charts, and so on, it is common to apply
> readily available software programs, such as HEC-RAS, as described
> later in this chapter.

> culvert play a significant role, as do the tailwater conditions for a
> particular storm event being applied. If the culvert application is in

> however, outlet-control circumstances can exist whereby the culvert
> outlet is not submerged (see reference material for a more detailed
> description of other flow conditions). Looking at Figure 9--12, the

> a pipe is the inner top of the pipe, often called the pipe soffit). If

> exit head loss is computed by

*H*~exit~ = (*V*^2^\>2*g*)~culvert~ - (*V*^2^\>2*g*)~channel~, (9--12)

> where *V* equals the velocity of flow in the culvert or downstream

> **DESIGN OF CULVERT CROSSING**
>
> A new culvert is to be designed and constructed replacing an existing

(a) Use the rational method with *Tc* = 18 min., *C* = 0.18 (for park
    > land), and the IDF curves shown in Figure 9--4 along with Equa-
    > tion (9--2) for a 10-yr storm.

(b) Establish the tailwater (*TW*) depth in the channel by calculating
    > the normal depth at the downstream end of the culvert using the
    > Manning's equation applied to the channel cross section shown in

(c) Establish the allowable total head loss, *H*.

3.  Establish the maximum allowable total head loss, *H*, using the
    > known maximum upstream water surface elevation allowed.

> The culvert is an outlet-control scenario because, given the lim-

> outlet is submerged (3 6 4.09), and we have an extremely flat slope
> along the channel (0.002 ft/ft), which will result in a higher *HW*
> relative to the conduit, due to the total head loss through the
> system; therefore, the conduit barrel is under pressure its entire
> length. Additionally, given the slope and flow for the channel, the
> critical depth can be calculated as 2.91 ft (see Chapter 7 for

> flow calculated above, which indicates the flow is subcritical in the

> The upstream invert or flow-line elevation of the culvert is

> 80.0 ft. Therefore, the downstream culvert flowline is 80 - 42(0.002)
> = 79.92 ft,
>
> where 0.002 is the slope of the culvert and 42 is the length of the
> culvert in feet. The *TW* elevation (the downstream water surface
> elevation) is then simply the elevation of the downstream culvert flow
> line plus the normal depth, *d*, of flow in the channel.
>
> *TW* = 79.92 + 4.09 = 84.01 ft.
>
> The maximum *HW* elevation (the upstream water surface eleva- tion) is

1.  Create a project in HEC-RAS titled *culvert example* and with a file
    name of *culvert.prj* (*File* S *New Project* S *type
    culvert*.*prj*)

2.  Create a new geometric data file with 4 cross sections and the cul-
    > vert. In the geometry file, create a River called *Ditch* and a
    > Reach called *Roadway*. Enter 4 cross sections (2 upstream and 2
    > down- stream of the culvert), with river stations 10, 50, 100, and
    > 140.

> For these cross sections, calculate the flow-line and top bank eleva-
> tions based on maintaining the upstream invert section 4 feet upstream
> and downstream of the culvert (stations 100 and 50, respectively).
> Refer to Figs. E9--3(a) and E9--3(b) for cross-section placement, and
> base all elevations on the upstream culvert invert elevation of 80.00
> ft. The upstream end of the culvert is technically at river station 96
> (100 - 4). Remember that in RAS, stationing is upstream to down, and
> cross sections are viewed looking downstream. The channel slope and
> all resultant cross-section elevation changes are based upon a 1%
> slope or gradient. The centerline station for the cross sections and
> cul- vert is set at station 18. Other data are as presented in Figure

3.  Create a new steady-flow data file by selecting the Enter/ Edit
    Steady Flow Data shortcut button and then selecting: *File* S *New
    Flow Data*. Enter/Edit Number of Profiles is 1. River is *Ditch,*
    Reach is *Roadway,* and River Station is 140 (the up- stream project

> **Detention Concepts and Applications**
>
> The basic premise for the use for detention basins within drainage
> collection systems is to reduce the peak discharges to predeveloped or
> preproject con- ditions. In floodplain management design, detention
> basins can have other uses, as will be discussed later within this
> chapter. Detention basins are com- monly used in conjunction with
> other infrastructure improvements, such as with the design of new land
> developments and storm sewer and roadside ditch collection system
> improvements.
>
> The development of an improvement project within an existing water-
> shed can consist of not only the construction of new facilities on raw
> land, but also the alteration of existing impervious levels and
> drainage character- istics in previously developed areas. As such, new
> developments, channel modifications, roadway reconstructions, and
> other common civil works proj- ects may lead to the creation of
> undesirable hydraulic impacts in the form of increased peak runoffs
> from various storm events. The identification, quantification, and
> mitigation of such impacts to receiving outlet channels or conduits
> and adjoining properties have become a primary focus in a typ- ical
> project development life cycle. This is a main activity for design
> engi- neers and engineering hydrologists.

> could be deemed impacts. These impacts may be negative or positive.
> The alteration of an existing watershed's drainage characteristics, as
> caused by an urban development project, for example, often leads to
> increased flow rates to the receiving outlet or downstream collection
> system. In many cases, these in- creased flow rates equate to rises in
> open-channel water surface elevations or the surcharging of existing
> storm sewer systems, which in turn often di- rectly relate to
> increased levels of surface flooding.
>
> While the elimination or significant reduction of the increase of
> surface flooding is desired, not all increases in flow rates from a
> given project area negatively impact receiving outlet channels or
> closed conduit systems. This would be the case if an outlet system had
> sufficient capacity to facilitate these increased flows without any
> effect or alteration to levels of surface flooding. Considering this
> discussion on various baseline parameters for the identification of
> negative impacts, the term *impact* actually implies *adverse impact*.
> An adverse impact would exist from a project development stand- point
> if the resultant increase in existing runoff flow rates caused by the
> al- teration to the watershed characteristics directly resulted in
> increased surface flooding, erosion, or other such physically damaging
> phenomena. After an improvement project is designed, using either
> advanced or conventional means, the system should be analyzed to
> ascertain if any adverse impacts do indeed exist as a result of the
> new or proposed improvements. If these im- pacts do exist, then
> mitigation measures should be undertaken. Typically, the determination
> and mitigation of hydrologic and hydraulic impacts can entail a rather
> complex analysis utilizing complex tools. Simplified ap- proaches are
> available in urbanized areas where storage coefficients or other such
> watershed parameters have been established to facilitate the develop-
> ment of stormwater management improvements. This may be the case, for
> example, if detention-basin requirements are simplified to a
> per-acre-of- detention-needed vs. the size of a given project area. As
> always, designers are encouraged to check local governing entities for
> such established criteria. A common form of mitigation is the use of a
> detention basin within the project design. There are numerous detailed
> references on detention design, but the basic fundamental sizing of a
> detention basin for the purposes of mitigating increased runoff due to
> a particular project is based on the com- parison of the existing to
> proposed discharge hydrograph at the outlet of the drainage collection
> system. The needed storage volume is determined from the area
> difference under the proposed vs. under the existing hydrograph, as
> illustrated in Figure 9--15. By providing this storage in the
> detention basin and properly sizing the outlet of the basin to govern
> the discharge to the desired predevelopment or preproject conditions,
> the negative effects or impacts of the given improvement project can
> be mitigated to mimic the existing-conditions peak flow rate, as can
> be seen in Figure 9--15. In other words, a properly designed detention
> basin can reduce the peak flow for the project proposed conditions to
> approximate the project existing conditions.

> It should be noted that the volume of runoff, at times, is indeed
> greater in the postproject improvement conditions (i.e., the proposed

>
> Mitigation measures using detention basins are not easily employed in
> densely developed urban areas. In many cases, available land for
> detention basins either does not exist or is too costly. As is often

>
> **Detention Basin Design**
>
> The actual design process of a detention basin is rather
> straightforward. As mentioned above, some communities already have
> predetermined param- eters for detention basin sizing that are based
> upon percentages of change in imperviousness or other such criteria.
> Given the absence of such prede- termined criteria for design
> purposes, the basic steps in the design of a deten- tion basin are:

1.  Develop the existing-conditions (preproject) runoff hydrograph for
    > the project area.

2.  After designing the drainage collection system or system improve-
    > ments for the project area, develop the proposed-conditions (post-
    > project) runoff hydrograph for the project area.

3.  Comparing the existing- to proposed-conditions hydrographs, deter-
    > mine the detention volume needed to reduce the proposed peak
    > discharge.

4.  Size the detention outlet and basin to use the storage provided and
    > to govern the discharge as desired.

> The above steps are for commonly applied detention basins used in
> conjunction with drainage collection systems. This is known as
> "in-line" detention, whereby the detention basin is actually in line
> with the drainage collection system, typically at the utmost
> downstream end, as connected to the outfall or receiving channel or
> other drainage system. "Off-line" deten- tion systems are commonly
> applied in floodplain management and typically involve side-flow weirs
> for connectivity to the drainage system. Detention basins used with
> drainage collection systems may indeed be off line, whereby the
> project area discharge conduit is restricted to govern the flow of
> discharge and a detention basin is connected to the collection system
> in a lateral sense; hence, it is an off-line basin. Off-line detention
> basins are discussed later in this chapter in conjunction with
> floodplain management design techniques.
>
> Many features and appurtenances are commonly employed in deten- tion
> basins. One such feature is the utilization of a flap gate or pinch
> valve at the outlet to the receiving outfall channel. Such a flap gate
> or similar de- vice prevents backflow into the detention basin as the
> outfall channel rises during a storm event, thereby utilizing the
> storage available in the basin. In some cases, the provision of
> detention storage within the watershed is viewed as a positive feature
> regardless of whether the inflow comes from a project site or from
> backflow from the receiving outfall channel. The use of flap gates or
> pinch valves with detention basins is just one of many design deci-
> sions in project planning. Should such a gate or valve be used, the
> head loss through it is sometimes ignored, as modern gates and valves
> can be specially fitted or even custom made for each application,
> resulting in rather minor losses in their use.

1.  Develop the existing- and proposed-conditions runoff hydro- graphs
    using SCS TR-20 methodology. There are many means of achieving this.
    Chapter 2 includes a brief description of this meth- odology. As
    commonly applied, computer programs are readily available that
    quickly compute runoff hydrographs based on TR- 20 methodology. One
    such program is the WinTR-55 Small Wa- tershed Hydrology program,
    available from the Natural Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS;
    formerly the SCS), a branch of the USDA. WinTR-55 is a single-event
    rainfall--runoff watershed model that uses the TR-20 methodology for
    developing runoff hydrographs \[see Fig. E9--4(b)\]. The program can
    be downloaded directly from the USDA and NRCS website (see Appendix
    E). WinTR-55 computes peak discharges and provides a graphic plot of
    runoff hydrographs. Furthermore, WinTR-55 produces a TR- 20
    hydrograph text output file that can be exported to any spread-
    sheet for use in calculating required storage volumes or for other
    reasons in support of a given design.

> After input of the above data for the existing and proposed
> conditions, WinTR-55 can be run to generate the hydrographs for export
> to a spreadsheet (but the tabular TR-20 hydrograph text
>
> data can be obtained from WinTR-55 and the data can be plotted and
> utilized by hand methods equally as well!).

2.  Within an electronic spreadsheet (or by hand methods), overlay the
    > existing and proposed hydrographs and visualize the impacts of the
    > proposed (postproject) conditions. Measure the area under the
    > proposed-condition curve compared to the existing-condition curve
    > to estimate the storage volume required, as illustrated in Figure
    > E9--4(c). Also, note the maximum existing-condition discharge or
    > runoff from this figure (or taken directly from the WinTR-55
    > output).

3.  Size the outfall pipe for a maximum discharge equal to the existing
    peak flow at the maximum allowable head differential between the
    tailwater elevation at the outfall and the maximum allowable water
    surface elevation in the detention basin. A commonly used equation
    for the head loss through a culvert flowing full is

> *H~t~* = (1 + *Ke* + 29*n*^2^*L*\>*R*^1.33^)*V*^2^\>2*g*.
>
> However, this requires solving iteratively and calculating *R* and *v*
> repeatedly. For round pipe conduit (the type of conduit that will be
> used for the basin outlet conduit), this equation can be simplified to
>
> *H~t~* = (1 + *Ke* + 183*n*^2^*L*\>*d*^1.33^)0.81*Q*^2^\>(*gd*^4^),

> where

4.  Determine the approximate dimensions of the detention basin,
    > assuming the basin to be square with side slopes of 3:1, as shown
    > in Figure E9--4(a). From the figure, the depth of the basin is
    > based on the flow line of the discharge pipe and the design water
    > sur- face elevation of the basin at the top of the emergency
    > spillway, which results in a depth of 15.5 ft (231.00 - 215.50).
    > The required volume was previously determined in step 2. With the
    > depth and volume known, the equation for a pyramidal frustum can

> The resulting dimensions are top side lengths of 306.44 ft and bot-
> tom side lengths of 213.44 ft. However, since the basin would be
> constructed holding depth, side slopes, and top side lengths con-
> stant, and we are starting with an estimate of the required volume, we
> will use top side lengths of 310 ft (slightly larger than the cal-
> culated 306.44 ft) with all other depth (15.5 ft) and slope (3:1)
> information the same. Should this prove inadequate in size in terms of
> the storage provided, we can increase the top side lengths.

5.  With the discharge conduit sized and the dimensions of the basin
    > established, develop a stage--storage--discharge relationship.

> This can also be done in conjunction with developing data for a
> storage-indication curve that will be used in the routing. Each stage
> in the table will have a specified amount of storage, *S* (based on
> the geometry of the basin determined in step 5), a specified discharge
> from the basin, *Q* (based on the differential head between the
> tailwater and stage level in the basin for the
>
> conduit sized in step 3), and a value for 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* based on the
>
> *Q* and *S* for that stage \[see Table E9--4(a)\]. This table will
> then
>
> be used in the routing procedure.
>
> *A note of caution at this point about terms:* Chapter 4 gives
> detailed descriptions of the routing procedures used herein, and the
> terms used in the design can become confusing if not man- aged. We
> have an inflow rate into the basin and an outflow rate out of the
> basin, all working integrally with the change in storage in the basin
> itself. The term "discharge" is used to refer to the outflow leaving
> the basin to the outfall channel, and the term "*Q*" is used in the
> tables and figure that follow to refer to this discharge rate. The
> inflow is referred to by "*I*" as utilized in Chapter 4.
>
> In the creation of the table in step 5 above, the elevation data are

6.  Route the proposed hydrograph thru the detention basin and outfall
    conduit to determine if the peak outflow and the size of the basin
    are adequate, using the data developed in the previous steps and the
    routing procedure described earlier. In this example, there is no
    reverse flow into the basin from the outfall channel due to the
    flap-gate or pinch-valve structure, and outflow from the basin into
    the outfall channel does not occur until the eleva- tion of the
    water in the basin is greater than the tailwater eleva- tion in the
    outfall channel. Use the table developed in step 5 to determine the
    outflow and stage at the end of each routing step. Check the
    resulting routing to determine if the maximum stage or discharge
    exceeds design parameters, or if the basin was oversized and can be
    reduced in size. If either of the design parameters was exceeded,
    the basin needs to be resized to avoid this.

> The following steps can be taken to follow Table 9--4(b):

(a) Tabulate the time steps in hours and minutes based upon the de-
    termined time step, Δ*t*, in step 5.

b.  Determine the inflow, *I~n~*~+~ ~1~, from the proposed-conditions
    > hydro- graph or from the output table of the WinTr-55 run above.

c.  Calculate (*I~n~* + *I~n~*~+~ ~1~) by simply summing the inflow at a
    > given time step with the inflow from the previous time step.

d.  Refer to the detailed routing description in Chapter 4, utilizing
    > Equation (4--13) as restated below.

> (*I~n~* + *I~n~*~+~ ~1~) + (2*S~n~*\> Δ*t* - *Q~n~*) = (2*S~n~*~+~
> ~1~\> Δ*t* + *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~).
>
> Note that at the first tabulated time step of 6.20 hr, all inflow,
> discharge, stage, and storage variables are equal to zero. At time
> 6.45 hr, (2*S~n~* Δ*t* - *Q~n~*) = 0 because *S~n~* and *Q~n~* = 0
> (the stor-
>
> age and discharge at the previous time step, 6.20 hr). Therefore,
>
> solving the above equation yields (2*S~n~*~+~ ~1~ Δ*t* + *Q~n~*~+~
> ~1~) = 0.06 cfs.
>
> *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~ is then determined directly from the storage-indication
>
> curve, interpolating between the data points as prepared in step 5.
> Subsequent time steps are calculated in the same fashion.

e.  Next, the storage is computed for each time step by solving
    > *S~n~*~+~ ~1~. Continuing with the step at 6.45 hr,

> (2*S~n~*~+~ ~1~\> Δ*t* + *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~) = 0.06 cfs.
>
> *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~ = 0,
>
> Δ*t* = 15 min = 900 sec.

Therefore,

> *S~n~*~+~ ~1~ = storage = 27 ft^3^.
>
> The calculation is repeated for every time step.

f.  For every known storage value, the stage is determined via inter-
    > polation from Table E9--4(a) created in step 5.

> The results tabulated in Table E9--4(b) demonstrate that the basin
> acts efficiently. The maximum stage elevation of 15.5 ft is not
> exceeded; however, the basin is almost fully utilized (maximum stage
> elevation of 15.02 ft). Notice that no outflow occurs until the
> minimum stage of 7.50 ft is achieved (223.00 ft - 215.50 ft), and in
> actuality the basin would drain out as the outfall channel flood water
> surface elevation recedes to its normal base flow depth. The inflow
> and outflow for the basin plot similarly to that shown in Figure
> E9--4(c). Notice the maximum discharge from the basin is 272.65 cfs,
> which is less than the existing-con- ditions peak discharge of 279
> cfs, thereby indicating a mitigated proposed condition.

> quality of life, transportation, and trade. Riverine flooding of
> properties and structures occurs for three fun- damental reasons:

1.  The properties and structures are in the floodplain of a given storm
    > event. In other words, they are simply too close to the channel or
    > within the channel's associated natural flood-prone areas;

2.  The channel's flood level for a given storm event has risen due to
    > increased development of the surrounding community, such that more
    > peak runoff discharges result in higher water surface elevations
    > in the channel; or,

3.  A combination of the above two.

> Other flooding scenarios can arise from poor or inadequate stormwater
> in- frastructure. Regardless of the reasons, flood damage reduction is

> improvement schemes. Two fun- damental schemes commonly employed
> are 1) channel improvements, and
>
> 2\) detention. Channel improvement is simply increasing the conveyance
> characteristics of a given channel reach. Obviously, increasing the
> cross- sectional area of a given channel reach, while keeping the same

> The second fundamental type of detention basin commonly utilized, an

> peak of the channel flood wave. It is common to use terms like
> "cutting off the top of the hydro- graph" when discussing the

> **Flood Damage Reduction Design Using HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS**
>
> A fundamental hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and design process in-
> tended to address the impacts of urbanization on a watershed is the
> develop- ment of flood damage reduction (FDR) projects. FDR can take
> many forms, ranging from structural solutions, such as channelization
> and detention to reduce water surface elevations, to nonstructural
> solutions, such as buyouts of homes to reduce damages caused by the
> high water surface elevations. Combinations of structural and
> nonstructural activities are often the most cost-effective solutions.
> Simply employing channel improvements to reduce water surface
> elevations and thereby alleviate flooding in one particular location
> or area can exacerbate flooding in other areas. This is generally due
> to the routing of previously stored flood waters downstream, as
> described previously within this chapter and in Chapter 12. An
> important process in an overall FDR analysis and design is to fully
> understand the behavior and response of the watershed, given the
> existing conditions and any planned improvements to reduce flood
> damage.
>
> There are many tools for developing reductions in water surface eleva-
> tions that yield flood damage reduction benefits. Some of the most
> readily
>
> available and commonly used are the HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS computer
> programs introduced in previous chapters. HEC-HMS can be readily used
> to evaluate the hydrology of a given watershed to examine the affects
> of development and urbanization. HEC-RAS can be used to efficiently
> model the behavior of a given channel or river system and then
> evaluate several design scenarios to provide reductions in water
> surface elevations. For de- tention basin design, HEC-RAS along with
> HEC-HMS can be utilized for full routing and the development of
> storage--discharge relationships, or HEC-RAS can be used in the
> unsteady simulation mode, whereby a known hydrograph is routed along a
> channel system in conjunction with a deten- tion basin.
>
> As the best way to illustrate the process described above, the
> following example is presented in stages that build upon one another
> in the develop- ment of an actual FDR design scenario.

>
> Stage 1: Preexisting-conditions HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS analysis to give a

>
> Stage 2: Existing-conditions HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS analysis to

> peak WSEL. These channel modifications, however, cause the peak
> outflow from this reach of channel to increase from 3801 cfs to 4267
> cfs, about 12%. At the same time, the storage in the overbanks is
> reduced from about 440 ac-ft to 0 ac-ft, as there is no flow or
> storage in the proposed overbank regions, while the volume below the
> new channel banks is increased from about 200 ac-ft to about 307
> ac-ft. This increase in flow rate and the corresponding total
> reduction in storage of about 333 ac-ft will cause a significant
> impact down- stream of this section of channel, as previously
> described in this chapter. In an actual detailed project situation,
> the downstream channel (or receiving stream) would be modeled as part
> of this study to determine whether there is no adverse impact. For
> this example, we will assume that if the peak flow rate can be reduced
> back to the Existing-conditions rate of 3801 cfs from 4267 cfs, the
> impacts of the channel modifications will have been fully miti- gated.
> The above steady-state analysis can be expanded to include unsteady
> state as shown below, but this presents a more complex solution.
>
> **Stage 4: Mitigated Proposed Conditions with an Off-Line Detention
> Basin**
>
> The final stage of the example is the introduction of an off-line
> detention basin, similar to the one illustrated in Figure 9--17, to
> mitigate the impacts of the channel improvement modifications
> introduced in Stage 3. Detention basins can be modeled by several
> methods, including steady-state diversion and detention in HEC-HMS. In
> this analysis, we use a more sophisticated unsteady modeling
> application in HEC-RAS to provide a view of advanced design
> techniques. A main benefit of using unsteady HEC-RAS at this point is
> that once the unsteady flow data is entered into the model, a large
> number of trials can be easily run to examine the behavior of a
> detention basin in various configurations and sizes. All of the
> channel and detention basin routing is performed in HEC-RAS. To ensure
> the best comparison between conditions with and without the detention
> basin, Existing condi- tions are also modeled in HEC-RAS
> unsteady-state mode.
>
> The detention basin is to be a peak "cut-off" or "shaving" basin, as
> previously described in this section, designed to reduce the peak
> outflow
>
> in a channel by removing water from the top of the hydrograph. An off-
> line detention basin, like that shown in Figure 9--17, with a
> side-flow weir will perform this task most efficiently, as the basin
> will not begin to fill until the hydrograph is already rising, and
> will, if designed properly, reduce the peak flow rate downstream of
> the basin.
>
> For the unsteady HEC-RAS model, several changes to the Existing-
> conditions geometry are necessary. None of them change the results
> when run with the steady-flow profiles. First, some cross sections
> need to be inter- polated, with a maximum spacing of 500 ft, to
> improve model stability, allow for assignments of flows along the
> channel, and allow for the placement of the detention basin. HEC-RAS
> cross-section interpolation assumes that there are linear changes
> between the end cross sections and allows the user to determine which
> points along the channel are 'equivalent.' For this exam- ple, since
> the original cross sections are the same, all of the interpolated
> cross sections will have exactly the same shape, but will be shifted
> vertically, and the distances between the cross sections will be
> adjusted. When interpolating cross sections, the user enters a maximum
> spacing, and HEC-RAS calculates the largest spacing for an equally
> spaced set of interpolated cross sections just closer together than
> that maximum. Reach stations for the new cross sections are calculated
> from the upstream and downstream reach stations, and interpolated
> cross sections are marked with an asterisk (\*) at the end of their
> names. There must be two cross sections between most boundary con-
> ditions, such as bridges, weirs, lateral structures, and the upstream
> and downstream ends of river reaches, so more cross sections than
> actually nec- essary were used to allow the detention basin to be
> placed closer to the end of the channel. The results of the
> cross-section interpolation and the addition of the off-line detention
> basin are illustrated in Figure E9--5(j).
>
> All of the routing in the unsteady model will be performed by unsteady
> HEC-RAS, thus eliminating the SvsQ iterations necessary with the
> steady- flow models. The outflows from the Upstream and Downstream
> subbasins will be applied at the appropriate locations along the
> channel. Since the outflow from the subbasins for Existing and
> Proposed is the same for developed conditions, flows from either one
> can be used for the unsteady analyses. The Upstream subbasin's flow
> should be applied at the upstream end as a flow hydrograph, and the
> Downstream subbasin's flow should be applied as a uniform lateral
> inflow hydrograph between RS 2.21538\* and RS 0.184616\*. The
> downstream boundary condition will be normal depth at a slope of
> 0.00075 ft/ft. When these changes are made, the unsteady
> Existing-conditions model can be run. The resulting model has a down-
> stream WSEL of 21.60 ft, which is 0.16 ft lower than the downstream
> WSEL in the steady-state model. The unsteady model's peak flow rate is
> 3704 cfs, which is about 100 cfs lower than the flow rate from the
> steady-state model. It is typical for unsteady models to differ
> slightly from their steady counterparts due to changes in routing and
> timing of the hydrographs. These

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 9 presents design applications in hydrology with detailed
> explanations, giv- ing examples of the design procedures commonly used
> in urban, rural, and floodplain hydrology applications. The design
> development of drainage collection systems using the rational method
> is presented along with the application of synthetic design storms.
> The design explanation continues with the presentation of the concepts
> of overland flows combined with underground conveyance systems. This
> is a very com- plex subject, as it involves the dynamic nature of
> urban storm water management. Example 9--1 provides a detailed example
> of the design of an urban storm sewer reconstruction project, and the
> HGL is developed and plotted in Figure 9--7 to il- lustrate the
> completed design; however, a more detailed design including the design
> of street inlets would usually be performed. Minor losses for storm
> sewers as well as the behavior of inlets are discussed at the
> conclusion of Section 9.2.
>
> In Section 9.3 the theory of culvert behavior is presented, and
> Example 9--2 is a detailed example using hand calculation methods for
> a culvert under outlet control.
>
> There is much more information on culvert analysis and design, and
> other reference sources are identified to develop a better
> understanding of culverts. More complex culvert design and analysis is
> presented, and an example of a culvert under inlet control modeled
> using HEC-RAS is included. Considering the impacts of urbaniza- tion,
> detention basin design is included in Section 9.4 along with a
> detailed example. The procedures in this example can be input into a
> spreadsheet as a convenient tool for detention basin sizing. In
> Section 9.5 floodplain management design issues are presented with a
> complete flood damage reduction project example. It is required that
> the user of this final example be rather familiar with HEC-HMS and
> RAS, as the various steps use this software extensively. The unsteady
> HEC-RAS modeling techniques presented in Example 9--5 are very much
> real applications, and they pro- vide an excellent opportunity for the
> user to understand the relationships of storage and routing in
> floodplain management design and analysis.

1.  Confirm the data for a 10-yr storm from Equation (9--2) and Table
    9--2 for 10-min, 15-min, 30-min, and 60-min durations. Compare to
    Figure 9--4.

2.  Construct the 100-yr, 24-hr synthetic design hyetograph using
    Equation (9--2) and 1-hr time intervals. Center the maximum
    intensity (the 1-hr intensity) at hr 12; the next highest intensity
    (determined by the depth from 2 hr - 1 hr over the 1-hr
    interval---hence, intensity) at hr 11; the next-highest intensity
    (depth from 3 hr - 2 hr) at hr 13; the next-highest intensity (depth
    from 4 hr - 3 hr) at hr 10; and back and forth similarly. Check the
    total volume under the hyeto- graph and see that it matches the
    total rainfall depth.

3.  Determine the runoff *Q* using Equation (9--1) for a project with
    *A* = 30 ac, *C* = 0.65, *Tc* = 12 min, and an *i*-value developed
    from Equation (9--2) for a 5-yr design storm.

4.  Determine the smallest required concrete round pipe and rectangular
    box sewers for *Q* = 125, 175, 225, and 275 cfs, *S* = 0.005 ft/ft,
    and *n* = 0.013 using Equation (9--3). Tabulate results and compare
    capacities and areas of the round to box sew- ers. Use standard
    increment sizes of 0.5 ft for round pipe and 1.0 ft for box sewers.

5.  Derive Equation (9--4) from Equation (9--3).

6.  For a *Q* = 100 cfs, calculate the *h~f~* = for a 3.5-ft-diameter,
    500-ft-long, round pipe sewer with *n* = 0.012 flowing full.

7.  Using the same flow and the same 500-ft-long round pipe sewer as in
    Problem 9.6, determine and plot the HGL and EGL for the sewer reach,
    given the fol- lowing additional information: U/S pipe invert
    elevation = 100.00 ft; D\>S pipe invert elevation = 96.00 ft; and
    the tailwater elevation for the sewer (i.e., the outlet water
    surface elevation) = 106.00 ft.

8.  Referring to Table E9--1(a), double the flows in Column 11 for each
    sewer reach and determine the minimum commercially available
    concrete box sizes required (available in 1.0-ft increments) for
    each sewer reach using a minimum box span and rise of 2.0 ft. Keep
    all elevation, length, slope, and roughness data the same as
    presented in the table. After sizing the box sewers, recompute the

> **PROBLEMS**
>
> HGL for the entire system. Evaluate any problems with maintaining a
> mini- mum actual velocity of 3 fps.

9.  Calculate the manhole losses, *h~j~*, of 90-, 60-, 45-, 30-, and
    > 15-degree manhole junctions with no special deflector for a
    > 4.5-ft-diameter round pipe sewer flow- ing full with *Q* = 150
    > cfs. Tabulate and compare the results.

10. Given the inlet in Figure 9--9 with *h* = 0.5 ft and *W* = 1.5 ft,
    > determine what minimum length, *L*, of inlet (in whole-foot
    > increments) is required for *Q* = 8 cfs, such that the depth of
    > flow at the curb does not exceed 0.5 ft.

11. Given the inlet in Figure 9--9 with *h* = 0.5 ft, *W* = 1.5 ft, *L*
    > = 4.0 ft, and a gutter depression depth = 0.33 ft, determine what
    > is the *Q* into the inlet if the depth of storm water at the curb
    > is 1.0 ft (i.e., there is 6 inches of water depth above the
    > standard curb height of 6 inches for a total depth at curb of 1.0
    > ft).

12. Repeat Example 9--2 using 3-ft-diameter round corrugated metal pipe
    > culverts with an *n* = 0.024. Determine the minimum number of
    > culvert barrels needed to convey the flow without overtopping the
    > roadway.

13. Repeat Example 9--3 using HEC-RAS but use a 100-yr storm at this
    > location. Recalculate *Q* for a 100-yr storm using the same *C*,
    > *A*, and *Tc* information provided in Example 9--2. Evaluate the
    > behavior of the 7 \* 3 box culvert and then examine the behavior
    > of a 6 \* 3 box culvert at this location. Document the differences
    > in culvert performance, including weir flow depths for com-
    > parative purposes. Determine the minimum span (width) of box
    > culvert needed to prevent overtopping of the roadway if the box
    > culvert rise (height) allowed is increased to 4 ft.

14. Repeat Example 9--4 but with the following changes to the data:

    a.  SCS TR-20 methodology data

        i.  Existing (preproject) *Tc* = 1.3 hr; changed from 1.0 hr

        ii. Proposed (postproject) *Tc* = 0.4 hr; changed from 0.45 hr

    b.  Figure E9--4(a) data

        i.  Emergency spillway and basin design elevation = 229.50 ft;
            > changed from 231.00 ft

        ii. Maximum basin depth = 14.0 ft (229.50 - 215.50); changed
            > from

> 15.5 ft
>
> All other data and information remain unchanged.

15. Repeat Example 9--5 using the same data except that the two
    > subbasins (Up- stream and Downstream) are 2.85 mi^2^ each now
    > (changed from 2.0 mi^2^ each). All other data remain unchanged.
    > This will necessitate extending the existing overbank regions of
    > the Preexisting- and Existing-conditions cross sections along the
    > same slopes to properly analyze the behavior of the channel in
    > steps 1 and 2. In step 3, increase the bottom width of the
    > Proposed cross section beyond 10 ft, keeping the same 4:1 side
    > cross slopes, until the flow is contained within the channel
    > banks. Adjust the weir and detention basin geometry as needed in
    > step 4 to fully mitigate the impacts, as described in the example.

**INTRODUCTION**

**TO GIS**

> **628**
>
> A geographical information system (GIS) includes: (1) attribute or
> feature information in a database format, (2) locational information
> for these attri- butes or features, and (3) analysis functions for
> deriving new information on spatial relationships. GIS has a wide
> application in a variety of civil and environmental applications,
> including demography, meteorology, transpor- tation, urban planning,
> and hydrology. In the past three decades, hydrologic applications have
> been revolutionized by GIS, making it an indispensable technology for
> digital terrain and hydrologic analysis of watersheds. The role and
> usage of GIS technology, software, data formats, and sources of
> geospa- tial data are essential to hydrologic analysis as covered in
> this chapter.
>
> Common to all definitions of a GIS is the concept of linking data with
> a geographical location, which is the definition of **spatial data**.
> Attributes within the context of GIS refer to the characteristic(s)
> mapped at a specific location. For example, attributes could be the
> population and demographics in a city block, or the slope of the land
> surface, or the land use for a given area. Successful use and adoption
> of GIS technology for any purpose depends on factors that extend
> beyond the data and the computer on which
>
> they reside. Effective use of a GIS system requires resources devoted
> to the computer hardware, GIS software, and user training in data
> characteristics and spatial analysis techniques. This chapter
> describes the background and use of GIS in hydrologic analysis and
> relates common GIS terminology and functions to specific hydrologic
> applications.
>
> A GIS can record observations or measurements, which can be thought of
> as **features**, **activities**, or **events**. A **feature** is a
> term used in digital cartography to refer to an item or piece of
> information placed on a map. Point features such as rain gages or a
> benchmark have location with no dimension (0-D), while line features
> such as a watershed boundary or river have several locations strung
> together to form an ordered sequence of points that are
> one-dimensional in space (1-D). Area features, such as the area
> representing a watershed or floodplain boundary, consist of lines that
> form a closed polygon, i.e., a two-dimensional feature (2-D). Besides
> phys- ical features, human **activities** are often described with
> geographical pat- terns and spatial distributions. Population maps,
> census maps, and urban infrastructure maps, e.g., sewers and water
> distribution networks, are exam- ples of human activities that can be
> mapped within a GIS. The temporal dimension of GIS data requires a
> definition of *when* something occurred, termed an event. Mitchell
> (1999) defines an **event** as something that occurs at a point in
> time and can be mapped over time. For example, a GIS data- base
> containing a time series of rainfall values at a point or over a
> watershed can be used to identify the accumulation of rainfall depth,
> duration and intensity in the selected time interval, summation during
> storm event, or long-term amounts such as annual precipitation. A GIS
> database containing spatial location, attributes, and temporal records
> supports queries and anal- ysis of the spatial and temporal dimension
> of hydrologic quantities such as rainfall.
>
> Ian McHarg (McHarg, 1995) popularized the use of GIS in landscape
> design in the 1970s. Its employment in census and population
> demographics and geography or urban planning disciplines gained
> recognition before its application to hydrology evolved. Like the
> adoption of electronic spread- sheet technology, first developed for
> accountants, and later used extensively in other scientific and
> engineering analysis, the application of GIS began in geography and
> has rapidly been adopted by other scientific disciplines. GIS is
> widespread and established in hydrologic applications, for which its
> accep- tance and growth were accelerated by the availability of:

-   Worldwide geospatial data, such as soils, topography, and land use/
    > cover

-   Inexpensive computer hardware capable of performing complex and
    > detailed computations

-   Training and education targeted to the engineering community

-   Generally available GIS software with extensions tailored for hydro-
    > logic analysis

> Active involvement in hydrology by the GIS community is represented
> today by user groups devoted to GIS technology applications to
> hydrology, natural resources management, or urban planning. National
> hydrographic and elevation datasets are available from the U.S.
> Geological Survey (USGS), digital soils data from the Natural
> Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and abundant other spatial data
> formatted for GIS use are avail- able from other federal and state
> agencies. Universities introduced GIS training into their engineering
> curricula to bridge the gap between technol- ogy and education, and
> technology centers offer training for technicians that can perform
> routine GIS functions.
>
> In hydrology, GIS is used for watershed delineation, runoff estima-
> tion, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and floodplain mapping.
> Digital representation of topography, soils, land use/cover, and
> precipitation may be accomplished using GIS data and methodology.
> These applications are enhanced through the use of GIS, because
> hydrology is inherently spatial in nature.
>
> Data types can differ, depending on the scale at which survey data and
> public GIS data are collected and compiled. The resolution and spatial
> detail found in generally available geospatial data may be appropriate
> for hydro- logic applications when dealing with large basins. However,
> in smaller water- sheds, the scale, spatial detail, and resolution may
> not be sufficient. Considerations of map scale and resolution are
> presented in Vieux and Thompson (2004) along with the standards for
> scale and resolution of GIS, remotely sensed imagery, and surveyed
> data collected for a variety of appli- cations including hydrology.
>
> The sections that follow provide an introduction to GIS concepts, data
> structures, geographic projections, and spatial analysis techniques
> applicable to hydrology. Further details may be found in the excellent
> textbooks and references mentioned and through online sources (see
> Appendix E).

**10.2**

> **GENERAL GIS CONCEPTS**
>
> Data used in GIS generally have a structure and coordinate system that
> is formed from **vector segments**, e.g., lines, points, or polygons;
> or is composed of a regular array of rectangular grid cells referred
> to as a **raster**. For exam- ple, digital representation of land
> surface elevations may be in the form of contour lines (vectors) or of
> a grid of elevations at regularly spaced intervals (raster format).
> The coordinate system used to locate vector or raster data is
> referenced to the earth surface so that the distance between features
> and spatial relationships between them can be derived. Data
> structures, map scale and spatial detail, datum issues, and coordinate
> systems are general concepts needed for understanding GIS usage and
> application to hydrology. A basic understanding of these issues is
> necessary to effectively utilize GIS systems for analysis of
> hydrologic information. Each of these topics is dis- cussed below in
> further detail.
>
> **Raster and Vector Data**
>
> GIS data are usually formatted in a **vector** or **raster**
> structure. A vector dataset maps a geographic feature using lines
> drawn between points or coor- dinate pairs. An advantage of vector
> formats is that a database containing multiple attributes may be
> associated with any given point, line, or polygon, whereas in the
> raster format only a single attribute is usually associated with a
> grid cell. Vector data are used to show rain gages as points, streams
> as lines, and the watershed boundary as a polygon in Figure 10--1
> (left). On the right, a raster of grid cells represents rainfall in
> relation to the watershed and other features in the map. Vector format
> supports the ability to store topology of the data, which defines the
> order and relationship among vector data. For example, a vector data
> structure containing topologic information could be used to represent
> a stream network within a watershed. A GIS system con- taining the
> data could be used to query and search for all downstream seg- ments
> affected by a spill or discharge of pollutants within the stream
> network. Raster data are used to describe spatially continuous
> information and are usually sampled on a regularly spaced grid, as
> seen in Figure 10--1 (right). Examples of raster datasets are digital
> elevation models (DEMs), gridded radar rainfall data, or land uses
> from satellite imagery. The vertical resolu- tion of the data and the
> reliability of the resulting delineated stream network for watersheds
> are described by Gyasi-Agyei et al. (2006).

> height="1.203124453193351in"}In many hydrologic applications of GIS, a
> combination of both vector and raster data is needed, depending on the
> specific application or data source. For example, mathematical and/or
> feature manipulation of two datasets to create a new dataset could be
> used to derive rainfall estimates over a watershed. The intersection
> of NEXRAD radar data (raster) and subwatershed delineations (vector)
> can be performed to calculate rainfall depth over each subwatershed.

> Spatial analysis tech- niques such as intersection, union,
> mathematical computation, buffer generation, dissolving boundaries,
> tabular data analyses, network analyses, and digital terrain modeling
> make GIS indispensable in hydrology as in many other disciplines. Such
> spatial operations create new knowledge about relationships between
> data layers.
>
> **Map Scale and Spatial Detail**
>
> The scale and resolution at which the data are collected or measured
> on a map is termed the **native scale** or resolution. Unlike paper
> maps, map scale is easily altered within a GIS system. Therefore, a
> distinction should be drawn between the inherent or native scale of
> the data and the displayed or printed scale. If the spot or point
> elevations are surveyed in the field on a grid of 100 m, then this is
> its native resolution. Once contours are interpo- lated between the
> points and plotted on a paper map, a native scale of the data is
> introduced. For example, if a paper USGS quad sheet is digitized, the
> native scale will be 1:24,000. As a result, performing an analysis of
> this data at a 1:1000 scale could adversely influence the accuracy of
> the analysis.
>
> A small-scale map is one in which features appear small. For instance,
> maps at 1:1,000,000 have the advantage of covering large areas, but
> show few details. Conversely, large-scale maps have features that
> appear large and show significantly more detail. A topographic map can
> be shown at any scale within a GIS, depending on the needs of the
> application, provided one does not exceed the accuracy supported by
> the data.
>
> **Datum and Spheroid**
>
> Geodesy is the branch of applied mathematics concerned with
> determining the size and shape of the earth and the exact positions of
> points on its sur- face. The earth is often treated as a sphere to
> make mathematical calcula- tions easier, but it is actually a
> **spheroid**. The earth must be treated as a spheroid to maintain
> accuracy in maps of large spatial extent, and a number of standard
> spheroids are commonly used to describe its shape. In North America,
> these include the Clarke 1866 Spheroid and the GRS80 (Geodetic
> Reference System of 1980).
>
> A horizontal datum is a reference frame used to measure locations on
> the surface of the earth. It defines the origin and orientation of the
> lines of latitude and longitude. A horizontal datum is always related
> to a specific spheroid. There are two types of datums: earth centered
> (geocentric) and local. A local datum is aligned so that it closely
> corresponds to the earth's surface for a particular area, such as the
> 1927 North American Datum (NAD27). This datum uses the Clarke 1866
> Spheroid, which passes through Meades Ranch, Kansas. Each point on the
> earth's surface can be defined with a latitude--longitude coordinate
> pair. Latitude and longitude represent
>
> the angles (N-S and E-W) to that point from the center of the earth.
> Stan- dard latitudes and longitudes used over the globe are then
> measured from the center of this spheroid, which does not necessarily
> correspond with the center of mass of the earth. The Clarke 1866
> Spheroid and NAD27 fit North America fairly well, but are not accurate
> for other continents. An earth- centered datum, such as the 1983 North
> American Datum (NAD83), is based on the GRS80 spheroid centered at the
> mass center of the earth, and is therefore more accurate for maps of
> larger extent than North America. The national geodetic survey is

> **Geographic and Cartesian Coordinate Systems**
>
> A geographic coordinate system is based on latitude and longitude, as
> defined above. A transformation or **projection** from a curved
> geographic coordinate system to a Cartesian coordinate system is
> necessary to view all or part of the earth as a flat map. Because it
> is impossible to represent a three-dimensional figure such as the
> earth as a two-dimensional map with minimal distortion, various
> projections have been developed to pre- serve one or more of the
> following properties: shape, area, distance, and direction.
>
> In choosing a projection, we seek to minimize the distortion in one or
> more of the above properties, depending on which aspect is more
> important. **Conformal** projections maintain local angles and shapes,
> **equal-area** projections maintain area, **equidistant projections**
> maintain distance, and **true-direction** maps maintain directions
> with respect to a fixed central point.
>
> No projection maintains all of the above characteristics, but some
> projections maintain more than one. For example, the Universal
> Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, commonly used in the United

> away from the central meridian. Because of this, the earth is divided
> into 60 UTM zones. The continental United States spans UTM Zones 10
> through 19. The coordinate in the east-west direction is 500,000 at
> the center of each zone. The north-south UTM coordinate is zero at the

> **DIGITAL REPRESENTATION HYDROLOGIC PARAMETERS**
>
> Parameters of importance to hydrologists that can be derived from
> digital data sources include rainfall, infiltration,
> evapotranspiration, and hydraulic roughness. Rainfall may be
> represented as a time series at a point measured at a gage, as a
> radial-polar array or a gridded array of rainfall rates derived from
> radar or isohyetal contours. Infiltration rates, derived from soil
> maps, are generalized over the polygon describing the soil-mapping
> unit. Land use/ cover may be used to develop evapotranspiration rates
> or estimates of hydraulic roughness from polygonal areas or from a
> raster array of remotely sensed surrogate measures.
>
> A dataset may be based on either a direct measure of the physical
> characteristics or an indirect (surrogate) measure requiring
> conversion or interpretation. An example of an indirect measurement is
> NEXRAD's esti- mation of rainfall from radar reflectivity. Chapter 11
> has a more detailed discussion of using NEXRAD rainfall for hydrologic
> applications.
>
> **Soil Type**
>
> Computation of direct runoff requires an estimate of infiltration
> character- istics for the different soil types in a drainage area.
> Soil-type data are widely available for the United States and can be
> downloaded from the Natural
>
> Resources Conservation Service at
> [www.nrcs.usda.gov.](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/) A **soil-mapping
> unit** is the smallest unit on a soil map that can be assigned a set
> of representative properties. Soil maps and the associated soil
> properties form a major source of data for estimating infiltration.
> Some adjustment is inevitable when esti- mating infiltration
> parameters from generalized soils databases for hydro- logic modeling.
> Obtaining infiltration parameters from soil properties requires
> reclassification of the soil-mapping unit into a parameter meaning-
> ful to the hydrologic model.
>
> **Land Use/Cover**
>
> The land surface condition can affect hydrologic processes such as
> runoff and evapotranspiration. A GIS map of the land use and
> associated cover is an important descriptor of the hydrology, whether
> it is vegetative, such as pasture or forest, or the surface is
> modified with asphalt or concrete pave- ment. Land use and land cover
> (LULC) GIS data are compiled for many applications and may be useful
> for hydrologic modeling. Digital LULC maps, derived from direct
> observation or remotely sensed data or digitized from paper LULC
> classification maps, can be used to develop hydrologic parameters such
> as hydraulic roughness, albedo, or aerodynamic roughness height, which
> influences evapotranspiration.
>
> General-purpose LULC maps may or may not contain sufficient detail or
> classification to be useful for deriving hydrologic model parameters.
> LULC maps and the classification scheme are generally not developed
> for hydrologic purposes. For example, in Figure 10--5 there is
> discrimination between pasture and cropland; however, the Anderson
> classification scheme used in USGS LULC maps makes no distinction
> between these two catego- ries (Table 10--1). In terms of runoff rate
> or evapotranspiration, these two categories may behave differently. In
> any case, the hydrologist must exercise judgment when interpreting
> generalized land use categories for purposes of hydrologic modeling.
>
> Hydraulic roughness is a parameter that controls the rate of runoff
> over the land surface. Classification codes from the Anderson
> classification scheme are listed in Table 10--1 with second-level
> categories indented below the major categories. Maps of hydraulic
> roughness can be derived using a lookup table that relates hydraulic
> roughness (see for example, Table 4-2) to the LULC classification
> scheme (Vieux, 2004). Simple reclassification of a LULC map into
> hydraulic roughness represents the deterministic varia- tion. Other
> sources of LULC may include remotely sensed data. In either case, a
> lookup table transforms the LULC into a map of hydraulic rough- ness
> parameters. On-site experience and published values are helpful in
> establishing at least an initial map for calibration of distributed or

> **DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF TOPOGRAPHY**
>
> Topography plays an important role in the distribution and flux of
> water in natural and man-made systems. The automated extraction of
> topographic parameters from **digital terrain models (DTMs)** using
> GIS is currently rec- ognized as a viable alternative to traditional
> surveys and manual evaluation of topographic maps (Moore et al., 1991;
> Martz and Garbrecht, 1992). A DTM is any digital representation of the
> terrain, such as a series of point elevations, contour lines, and
> triangular facets, composing a **triangulated irregular network
> (TIN)**, also known as a **digital elevation model (DEM)**.
>
> **Contours**
>
> Many existing paper maps (USGS 7^1^-minute quadrangle series) use
> contours to describe the topography. An **elevation contour** is a
> line connecting the points on the earth's surface having the same
> elevation. Representation of
>
> a surface using contours shows gradients and relative minima and
> maxima. Many of the original DEMs produced by the USGS were generated
> by linear interpolation of digitized contour maps. The USGS elevation
> contours have intervals and errors that may be larger than those
> associated with surveyed contours used in civil engineering site
> development. However, even though the elevations may be uncertain,
> fail to show topographic detail, and contain vertical/horizontal
> errors, the contour data can be useful for preliminary delineation of
> watershed areas and computation of channel slope for hydro- logic
> analysis.
>
> **Digital Elevation**
>
> One of the most useful types of geospatial data is digital terrain.
> Useful hydrologic quantities can be derived from a DEM. Other terrain
> attri- butes such as slope and drainage direction are derived from a
> DEM. A model of terrain traditionally relies on contours of equal
> elevation that define watershed boundaries, channel slope, and other
> features. Within a GIS, representation of terrain can be accomplished
> with contours, gridded elevations (also known as a raster DEM), and
> triangular irregular net- works (TIN). Watershed characteristics such
> as slope and drainage length can be derived from a digital model of
> the terrain. A **raster DEM** consists of an array of numbers
> representing the spatial distribution of elevations. It may consist of
> elevations sampled at discrete points or the average elevation over a
> specified segment of the landscape---usually the former. Raster DEMs
> are one of the most widely used elevation data structures because of
> the ease with which computer algorithms are implemented using
> grid-based data.
>
> Digital elevation data are acquired through a technique that relies on
> aerial photography to produce a stereographic image. With survey
> controls to establish horizontal and vertical position (elevation),
> contours are produced from the stereographic images. Interpolation of
> elevation from the contours results in a regularly sampled grid of
> elevations, which are then used to define watershed drainage areas and
> other derivative quantities. Recent advances in laser altimetry called
> light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can achieve submeter resolution.
> Due to expense, acquisition of LiDAR data is usually reserved for
> special projects of lim- ited extent, such as floodplain mapping,
> where high impact or economic value demands high resolution. Due to
> high sampling frequency of the reflected laser light, many nonterrain
> features are recorded that must be removed by postprocessing of the
> data. LiDAR elevation data are col- lected and processed as a regular
> array of elevations in raster format. Digital data describing terrain
> are available for the United States and much of the world from the
> Internet at 1-km or better resolution, and rounded to the nearest one
> meter in elevation. The USGS has produced these DEMs at 90-meter
> resolution for most areas in the United States,
>
> with 30-meter data commonly available and even 10-meter resolution in
> some U.S. locations (see Internet Resources at the end of this
> chapter). While generally available DEM data are useful for analysis
> of larger watersheds, they may be too coarse for small drainage areas,
> urbanized areas, or flat terrains that lack sufficient vertical
> resolution, i.e., elevation difference for reliable delineation.
>
> A raster DEM can be used to delineate efficiently watershed boundar-
> ies, stream networks, and hydrologic characteristics of a watershed.
> Many of the methods used for watershed delineation stem from Peuker
> and Doug- las (1975), O'Callaghan and Mark (1984), and Jenson and
> Domingue (1988). Many of the innovations since these pioneering
> methods deal with difficul- ties posed by pits, anomalies, and flat
> areas within the digital representation of terrain. While a raster DEM
> can produce accurate boundaries, additional processing is usually
> required to force the boundary to agree with accepted or known
> boundaries. Errors in automatically generated boundaries can stem from
> the precision of the elevation model among other factors (Fisher and
> Tate, 2006), which may not be sufficient to pick up boundaries in flat
> areas. Various methods have been developed for overcoming the
> difficulty with flat areas when delineating a watershed from digital
> terrain data that may contain pits or anomalies. Zhu et al. (2005)
> developed a hybrid method for depression filling and scanning
> neighboring cells for assigning flow direc- tion over flat areas. The
> relationship between the drainage network and hydrologic response is
> termed geomorphic. Moussa (2003) compared and classified the basin
> shape and delineated stream network in an effort to identify scale
> effects present in the relationship between morphometric properties
> and the basin hydrological response. Selecting a threshold that
> defines a stream channel will result in a more or less detailed stream
> channel network that should correspond to actual watershed geomorphic
> character- istics. Methods for automatic delineation of watershed
> boundaries from DEMs are discussed in Section 10.5.

> **Triangulated Irregular Network**

> Stream and watershed delineation from DEMs are presented by Olivera

    > vertical units of meters.

-   Resample original DEM to a selected resolution.

-   Merge stream network and basin/subbasin outline into a DEM to ensure
    > proper flow direction.

-   Use Arc Hydro Tools extension to produce flow direction, flow
    > accumulation, and a stream grid.

> The resulting watershed maps demonstrate the burn-in procedure using a
> combination of raster and vector map information. The flow direction
> map is for use in the distributed hydrologic model, V*flo*™. An
> alternative approach is to use the HEC-GeoHMS processing module to

> Interpretation of the dominant land use category is needed to express
> the category in terms of an appropriate value of the corresponding

> The steps followed in the presentation are:

-   Reclassify land use/soils datasets to hydrologic parameters defin-
    > ing hydraulic roughness and infiltration.

-   Use multiplicative factor when reclassifying integer-based land
    > use/soils classes, then divide out multiplicative factor with
    > Raster Calculator (RC).

-   Resample roughness/infiltration values to desired V*flo*™ model grid
    > resolution.

-   Clip the resampled grid to a specific model domain.

-   Export roughness/infiltration grids and load in V*flo*™ as ArcGIS
    > Grids or ASCII files.

> The word *radar* is an acronym for radio detection and ranging. Radar
> was originally developed in the 1930s as a simple device for detecting
> air- craft. It has evolved to a complex system involving transmitter
> and receiver components coupled with a computer processing system for
> detection of a variety of targets. Some of these targets are
> meteorological in nature and therefore of interest in hydrology. A
> radar system transmits pulses of elec- tromagnetic energy in the
> microwave frequency spectrum and then "listens" for the strength of
> the reflected signal. The timing of the returned signal compared to
> the transmitted pulse gives the range or distance to an object. The
> strength of the returned signal, i.e., reflectivity, depends on the
> cross section of the object and an electrical property called the
> dielectric constant. The returned signal strength is also termed
> reflectivity. The Doppler effect measures whether the object is moving
> away from or toward a radar instal- lation. Relative velocities

support are provided by the NEXRAD agencies, which are the NWS, the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Air Force. NEXRAD is
technically known as the WSR-88D (weather surveillance radar prototyped
in 1988; the D is for Doppler). WSR-88D is a Doppler radar with a 10-cm-
wavelength (S-band) transmitter/receiver that records reflectivity,
radial Doppler velocity, and the spectrum width of reflected signals. A
typical WSR-88D installation is shown in Figure 11--1. Located near
Norman, Okla- homa, the radar installation designated by the call sign
KTLX was the first operational WSR-88D radar installed in the United
States.

Approximately 160 WSR-88D radars have been installed in the conti-
nental United States (CONUS) and abroad at U.S. military installations.
Figure 11--2 shows the distribution of WSR-88D radars nationwide along
with 230-km range circles centered over each radar installation.
Coverage of the United States is generally good except in western areas,
where few radars exist or terrain causes blockage. Within the
continental United States, there is usually at least one WSR-88D radar
within 230-km range of a given location. From the strength of the
returned signal, and after adjusting for distance and other effects,
certain characteristics can be deduced about the target. Water in the
form of raindrops, hail, or snowflakes reflects energy transmitted by
the radar. In the case of raindrops, the strength of the returned signal
is related to the rainfall rate. The primary use of radar in hydrology
is the estimation of precipitation based on reflectivity.

> Atmospheric conditions between the radar and target affect the effi-
> ciency with which microwave energy is reflected back to the radar
> receiver. Backscattering and absorption of the radar signal by the
> raindrops in the intervening atmosphere reduce, or attenuate, the
> signal strength. With dis- tance, signal strength is further
> attenuated, making accurate rainfall-rate estimation difficult. The

> in the atmosphere, below which liquid and frozen hydrometeors may
> coexist. In tropical latitudes, the frozen state is almost never

>
> **Radar Equation**
>
> Reflectivity values are obtained from radar measurements of the
> backscat- tered power for a particular DSD. If the object is small in
> relation to the wavelength of the impinging radiation, the Rayleigh
> approximation is used. Under this assumption, Rayleigh backscattering
> of radiation of wavelength l from raindrops of diameter *D* is valid
> when *D* 6 l 16 . The WSR-88D radar operates at a frequency equivalent
> to a wavelength of 10 cm (also referred to as S-band). Raindrops
> rarely exceed 4 or 5 mm before they break up into smaller drops.
> Backscattered radiation by raindrops measured with a 10-cm-wavelength
> radar appropriately uses Rayleigh scattering to estimate the rainfall
> rate, since the permissible diameter l 16 = 100 16 = 6.25 mm. Objects
> in the atmosphere larger than 4 or 5 mm differ in scattering proper-
> ties and would be described by the Mie rather than the Rayleigh
> backscat- tering property (AMS, 2000).
>
> In radar meteorology, the Probert--Jones equation is also known as the
> radar equation (Doviak and Zrnic, 1993). The Probert--Jones equation
> for meteorological radar relates received radar-measured power, *P~r~*
> , to charac- teristics of the radar and to characteristics of the

> width, wave- length, and antenna size; *L* represents attenuation
> losses; *Z* is the radar reflectivity of the target; and *r* is the
> range to the target. Reflectivity, *Z*, is expressed in units of
> mm^6^/m^3^, or the sixth power of the diameter of rain- drops in mm
> per cubic meter.
>
> Because the returned power decreases according to the square of the

> **Reflectivity--Rainfall Relationship**
>
> What is rain? While we all have ideas about rain from experience, to
> under- stand how radar is used to estimate rainfall we must examine
> rainfall from the radar point of view. To determine the rainfall rate

>
> When gage-adjusted radar is used as rainfall input to lumped or dis-

>
> The WSR-88D radar is called a volume-scanning radar, because as the
> antenna rotates, it covers the surrounding atmosphere with successive
> tilts, beginning at 0.5-degree angles and incrementing approximately
> by 1 degree with each revolution. These measurements extend over the
> entire volume of the atmosphere, out to 460 km in range for
> reflectivity and 230 km for precipitation. Depending on the
> volume-scanning pattern (VCP), the rate at which each volume scan is
> completed varies from 5 or 6 minutes during precipitation to longer
> durations during *clear air* mode. Rates of data acquisition are 12,
> 10, and 6 volume scans per hour for VCP 11, VCP 21, and VCP 32,
> respectively. These variable rates have important conse- quences on
> the reflectivity and derived precipitation products. From a hydrologic
> viewpoint, the VCP determines the time resolution of rainfall
> intensities and depth estimates. During a storm event, a NEXRAD radar
> operator may switch from VCP 11 to VCP 21 and back several times,
> caus- ing variable time-step precipitation estimates or hyetographs.
> New volume scanning strategies have been put into practice by the NWS
> to measure quickly evolving severe storms more rapidly in less than
> 2--3 minutes. To use derived estimates of rainfall, interpolation to

> The Level II base data generated by the NEXRAD system are composed of
> reflectivity, Doppler velocity, and spectrum width. Reflectivity is of
> interest to hydrologists because the reflectivity data, reported in
> decibels of reflec- tance, dBZ, may be transformed into rainfall
> rates. *Z-R* relationships, as dem- onstrated, depend on a number of
> factors, including the DSD, making it necessary to calibrate the
> resulting rainfall rates with rain gages. During the stages of
> precipitation processing by the system, NWS algorithms are designed to
> remove spurious reflectivity caused by sidelobe contamination, ground
> clutter, and anomalous propagation of the beam; reflectivity is
> converted to rainfall rate using a *Z-R* relationship; and rain rates
> are accumulated over time and adjusted based on rain gage reports.
> Provisions have been made for calibrating to rain gages located under
> the radar umbrella, although this has not been fully realized
> operationally by the NWS. Processing rainfall infor- mation from Level

> "super resolution" Level II data is planned for the NEXRAD system,
> which will be at 0.25-km range resolution and one-half degree azimuth.

> Rainfall rates are estimated from radar using a selected *Z-R*

> event producing the precipitation. The standard *Z-R* relationship
> used with the initial installation of all WSR-88D radars in the United
> States was *Z* = 300*R*^1.4^. Since deployment, the NWS has adopted
> several *Z*-*R* relationships that are applicable to convective,

>
> With adequate maintenance, calibration, and data archiving, rain gage
> net- works provide important point measurements of rainfall, which are
> useful for rainfall estimation. Any measurement is subject to
> measurement errors. Rain gage measurement accuracy and precision
> depend on the type of gage, periodic maintenance, rain shadowing by
> adjacent obstructions, clog- ging, malfunctioning telemetry, and wind-
> and evaporation-induced losses. After rain gage data have been checked
> for missing data and systematic and random errors, they are used in
> conjunction with radar to estimate rainfall.
>
> The process for combining radar and gage estimates relies on comput-
> ing a systematic error, or bias correction factor, and applying the
> correction to the unadjusted radar rainfall accumulations. Computing a
> single bias cor- rection factor that is spatially constant is called a
> mean field bias correction. Allowing the correction factor to vary in
> space is termed a local bias correc- tion. Seo et al. (1999) and Seo
> and Breidenbach (2002) describe the mean field and local bias approach
> to gage correction of radar. After bias correc- tion, random errors
> related to scale differences between gage orifice and radar sample
> volume and updraft/downdraft effects will remain. After adjusting for
> systematic error, the radar estimate is consistent, though not
> necessarily in precise agreement with rainfall measured at a point
> location represented by the gage.

> The model setup and data required are as follows.

1.  **Geospatial data.** Geospatial data are used to set up V*flo*™
    starting with a digital elevation model (DEM) for the derivation of
    slope and flow direction; remotely sensed land use/cover for
    overland hydrau- lic roughness; impervious area and soil
    characteristics for the deriva- tion of Green and Ampt infiltration
    parameters and soil depth; channel geometry and hydraulic
    characteristics.

2.  **Precipitation inputs.** Rainfall and snowmelt may be input on a
    grid- ded basis as maps, or input as uniformly distributed rainfall
    rates/ accumulations. Distributed precipitation formats supported
    include radar formats, e.g., NEXRAD Level II reflectivity, and ESRI
    ASCII grids. Automated filtering of the radar grid into the model
    grid is

> available when geographic projection information is provided. Point
> hyetographs may be input for subareas such as basins or uniformly over
> the entire domain with user-defined or SCS-type hyetographs. Snowmelt
> is modeled on a distributed basis using the temperature index method.
> Synthetic dynamic (moving) design storms are simu- lated for defined
> hyetographs, movement, and direction.

3.  **Runoff routing.** The kinematic wave equations are solved on a
    > grid- cell basis within a drainage network composed of finite
    > elements. The formulas are adapted to represent overland and
    > channel hydrau- lics. Floodplain storage effects can be simulated
    > using the Modified Puls method to account for attenuation due to
    > temporary storage. Complex channel hydraulics can be represented
    > by (1) rating curves for stage area/discharge, (2) surveyed

4.  **Soil moisture and infiltration.** The infiltration module is the
    > Green and Ampt equation, which relies on the soil properties to
    > model runoff. Infiltration rate excess runoff is computed in each
    > grid cell as a func- tion of soil properties and antecedent
    > conditions. Once the soil storage capacity is filled, saturation
    > excess runoff is then computed. When the soil moisture is modeled
    > over time, the infiltration rate is adjusted to account for a
    > range of soil moisture. The rate of soil moisture deple- tion is
    > limited by the climatologic evapotranspiration (ET) rate and
    > available soil moisture. Impervious area and initial abstraction
    > may be set to account for urbanization effects or ponding on the
    > land surface.

5.  **Distributed output.** A feature unique to distributed models is
    > the capability to output distributed runoff and other hydrologic
    > quanti- ties at any location. This capability supports generation
    > of hydro- graphs at locations selected in the drainage network
    > regardless of current watershed delineations. Distributed runoff
    > can be used for water quality modeling and transport such as
    > debris flow forecasting where heavy rainfall, soil conditions, and
    > slope play a role in the initiation of landslides and subsequent
    > transport of mud and debris. Because the model outputs stage at
    > distributed locations along the channel, inundation mapping can be
    > accomplished that is more detailed than routing in channel
    > reaches.

> The V*flo*™ model is designed for ingest of radar or gridded
> precipita- tion on an event scale, or over a longer-term continuous
> basis. In the latter case, a series of distributed rainfall grids are
> provided and used along with potential evapotranspiration to model
> runoff. Cumulative runoff volume, infiltration volume, and discharge
> are tabulated during the continuous sim- ulation period. Thus, with
> continuous simulation, the history of storm event depth, hyetographs,
> duration, interarrival time, and the effects of evapora- tion on
> runoff can be modeled.
>
> **Hydrologic Model Summary**
>
> **HEC-HMS.** Two options exist for importing WSR-88D data into HEC-
> HMS. One method is to take the average rainfall from the radar grid
> cells within a basin or subbasin and create a pseudo-precipitation
> gage. The time step can vary from about 5 minutes up to a user-defined
> increment. HEC-HMS is then run with radar rainfall as input, and
> output hydrographs are compared to observed stream gage informa- tion.
> The number of subbasins in the HEC-HMS model affects the resulting
> hydrograph accuracy, because averaging high- and low-inten- sity
> rainfall over larger areas can cause discrepancies in the modeled
> watershed response. Another option in HEC-HMS is to use gridded data
> in the Modified Clark (or ModClark) unit hydrograph method. In either
> case, it is important to use the radar data that have been adjusted to
> gage accumulations, or at least compared for consistency. Import
> options exist for bringing both of these data types into the HEC-HMS
> model. Basin hyetographs derived from radar can be input in a manner
> similar to a rain gage hyetograph.
>
> **Flood warning systems.** Radar rainfall can provide timely
> information for estimating river or stream levels related to flooding.
> The advantage of radar is that rainfall can be extracted directly over
> basins of interest in near real time. Based on a selected threshold
> base of rainfall accu- mulations, a flood threat can be recognized and
> actions taken to miti- gate impacts or reduce public exposure to
> flooded conditions. Besides computing thresholds, running a hydrologic
> model in real time using the radar rainfall as input can provide
> additional flood threat informa- tion (Bedient et al., 2003; Vieux and
> Bedient, 2004; Janek et al., 2006). Lead time and the hydrologic
> response time of a basin can limit the area that can be feasibly
> forecast. Soil moisture tracking by the hydro- logic model run in real
> time is an important consideration in most watersheds, such that the
> model will be properly initialized by anteced- ent soil moisture
> conditions. Chapter 12 presents more details on flood alert systems.
>
> **Distributed hydrologic models.** Distributed models preserve the
> spatial variation of slope, hydraulic roughness, infiltration, and
> rainfall input without lumping to the watershed-level of aggregation.
> Such models use physics-based conservation equations to represent
> overland and channel flow. Full dynamic, kinematic, and diffusive wave
> analogies are used to derive systems of equations that are then solved
> by finite- difference or finite-element methods. V*flo*™ is a
> distributed model that runs as a real-time operational application or
> as a desktop model (Vieux et al., 2003; Vieux and Vieux, 2002; Vieux,
> 2004). Parameters are derived from geospatial data and published
> physical characteristics according to the method described in Vieux
> (2004) and Vieux and Moreda (2003).
>
> **Additional Resources**
>
> Understanding the usage and variability of precipitation can be
> investigated using the tutorials provided online for V*flo*™. See the
> website for supplemental resources that include access to model
> software, tutorials, and required data.
>
> **EXAMPLE 11--4**
>
> **V*flo*™ MODEL EXAMPLE**
>
> As this example demonstrates, the physics-based distributed approach
> produces hydrograph response that matches observed flow without model
> parameter calibration. The V*flo*™ model uses the conservation of mass
> and momentum equations to route rainfall excess through a network com-
> posed of overland and channel cells. Runoff from both infiltration
> rate excess (i.e., when rainfall rate exceeds infiltration rate) and
> saturation ex- cess (when the fillable porosity within the soil
> profile becomes saturated) is modeled simultaneously in the watershed.
>
> The hydrograph response to rainfall input is determined from the
> hydraulic characteristics of the drainage network. The rainfall rates
> in each grid cell determine how much runs off, while the slope and
> hydrau- lic roughness determine the flow depth and velocity of flow in
> overland and channel cells. The configuration of the drainage network
> that defines the watershed shape and the diversity of hydraulic travel
> time also deter- mine the hydrograph shape as expected from discussion
> in previous chap- ters on watershed response. The distribution in time
> and space of rainfall intensity coupled with terrain characteristics
> become an important deter- minant of the response in terms of runoff
> volume, peak discharge, timing of the peak, and the entire hydrograph
> shape.
>
> Accurate portrayal of the distributed drainage network, vegetative
> cover, and soil characteristics can result in hydrograph predictions
> that agree well with observed streamflow without model parameter
> calibration. An example of this agreement is offered for the 9.58
> mi^2^ Fishpot Creek located in eastern Missouri for three events, two
> in May and July of 2008, and one in February of 2009. The model
> parameters and radar rainfall used in this case study are presented
> below and are made available via the website that contains detailed
> datasets for V*flo*™ and radar rainfall.
>
> **Watershed Description**
>
> To begin the watershed analysis, digital terrain is obtained from
> LiDAR presented in Figure E11--4--1, and is used to extract the
> drainage network and slope. Channels are delineated for 10% of the
> area. The drainage network extracted by the V*flo*™ module called
> AutoBop is seen in Fig- ure E11--4--2. The cells are assigned as
> channels such that channel cells comprise 10% of the watershed. See
> Chapter 10 for a description of GIS watershed delineation. The
> watershed is long and narrow implying that runoff from the upper part
> of the watershed will take longer to arrive at the outlet than runoff
> following flow paths nearer to the outlet.

> **Parameters**
>
> Once the network has been extracted, parameters are assigned to
> overland and channels based on land use/cover, or more specific
> information known for the watershed (see Chapter 10). Maps of
> hydraulic roughness are derived from standard lookup tables of land
> use/cover (see for example, Vieux, 2004,
>
> p\. 124) and used to populate the model grid. Table E11--4--1 presents
> the range of distributed parameters used to obtain the three event
> hydrographs. The soils in the Fishpot Creek are classified as a silt
> loam in the top layer, 0−7 inches, (A-horizon) with urban built-up
> areas for over 60% of the soils in the watershed. The clay
> accumulation in the B-horizon of the soil transi- tions to silty clay
> loam at deeper depths. From sand, silt, clay, and gravel fractions,
> the Green and Ampt parameters of hydraulic conductivity, wet- ting
> front suction, and porosity are estimated for the A-horizon of the
> soil profile. Urban development is evident from the patterns observed
> in the impervious map seen in Chapter 10, Figure 10--5(a). For this
> watershed, imperviousness is estimated from the NLCD land use/cover
> and averages

0.31 (31%). Converted the NLCD to roughness, the watershed ranges from

> 0.024 to 0.2, with an average of n=0.040 in the watershed. Both the
> Green-- Ampt and hydraulic roughness parameters in Table E11--4--1 are
> sampled from the original maps into the 75-m model grid for the basin.
>
> **Radar Rainfall Input**
>
> Inputs to the model consist of gauge-adjusted radar rainfall (GARR);
> that is, rain rates have been adjusted by the local bias correction
> described herein Chapter 11. Three events are tested using GARR and
> the output simulated at the USGS 07019120 stream gauge and compared to
> observed flow during this events. In Figure E11--4--3, the rainfall
> total (upper image) and the basin- averaged hyetograph (lower) are
> shown for the July 28, 2008, event. The total rainfall for this event
> averages 1.37 in. with the main runoff producing rain rate over 1.5
> in./hr falling between 3:30 and 4:30 across the basin.

> as well as the need for better planning and enhanced emergency
> response to severe storm events in both the short and long term. The

> flood warning systems to reduce flood-related damages in Houston,
> Texas.
>
> Severe storms and the resulting major floods have taken their toll in
> the United States, especially over the last 25 years. Figure 12--1,
> created by the National Climatic Data Center, shows the distribution
> of 67 various types of natural disasters with damages in excess of 1
> billion dollars that occurred between 1980 and 2005. The image is
> dominated by hurricane- and flood- related occurrences, particularly
> in the southeastern and south central regions of the country. The vast
> majority of these disasters occur in or near highly urbanized cities
> and coastal areas. Notable among them are Hurri- canes Katrina (2005),
> Ike (2008), Andrew (1992), the midwest floods along the Mississippi
> (1993), Hurricanes Rita (2005), Charley (2004), and Ivan (2004). The
> damages for these events alone totaled over \$350 billion. Other, less
> costly, but still significant flood-related damages can be seen in
> other portions of the United States. The figure clearly demonstrates
> the severity of the flood problem at the national level, even after
> years of investment in "flood control" and the improvement of severe
> weather forecasts.

**12.2**

> **FLOOD MANAGEMENT**
>
> **ISSUES AND BASIC TERMINOLOGY**
>
> Flooding and its associated damages have been with us throughout
> history. While there are innumerable definitions for the words *flood*
> or *flooding,* after the major midwest flood of 1993 a fairly complete
> definition was pro- vided by the U.S. Executive Office of the
> President (USEOP). The USEOP defined a flood as "a general and
> temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry
> land areas from the overflow of river and/or tidal waters and/or the
> unusual accumulation of waters from any source that may be associated
> with undesirable effects to life and property" (USEOP, 1994). The
> definition emphasizes certain critical aspects of flooding such as
> inunda- tion and damage, aspects which will be defined and highlighted
> throughout this chapter.
>
> A **floodplain** can be defined as low lands adjoining a channel or a
> river, stream, watercourse, or lake that have been or may be inundated
> by flood- water. Figure 12--2 shows a typical floodplain as the area
> of inundation to be expected, on average, once every 100 years. Most
> major channel and river systems have floodplains defined by the
> Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through the National Flood
> Insurance Program (NFIP), as well as by the U.S. Army Corps of
> Engineers (COE). The **floodway** is an area within the floodplain
> that contains the fastest-moving water. It is com- puted by modeling
> encroachment on either side of the channel such that the floodplain
> elevation increases by one foot. This is normally computed with a
> model such as HEC-2 or HEC-RAS (see Chapter 7). The area between the
> floodplain and the floodway is called the flood fringe.

> A schematic of a 100-year floodplain and its associated floodway is
> pre- sented in Figure 12--2. Significant development within a
> floodplain results in significant losses in water resources,
> ecological resources, and human resources that may easily outweigh the
> property value of the floodplain. The floodplain includes a natural
> means of flood and erosion control that reduces sedimenta- tion,
> provides large amounts of storage, and naturally reduces flood peaks
> and valleys. With respect to water quality, the floodplain can filter
> nutrients and impurities from runoff prior to deposition in the river
> and serves as a natural temperature and organic waste moderator. From
> the ecological perspective, floodplains increase biological
> productivity and provide important fish and wildlife habitats. The
> integrity of the existing ecosystem is maintained by a sustained
> biodiversity and an atmosphere conducive to plant and animal growth.
> Often, these areas serve as natural habitats or wildlife corridors for
> endangered species. Floodplains represent a wealth of human resources
> by providing prime locations for aquaculture, enhanced agricultural
> lands, and open space that can be used for public recreation or nature
> appreciation.
>
> **Floodplain management**, a term often incorrectly used
> interchangeably with *flood control,* is an overall decision-making
> process whose goal is to achieve the appropriate use of the
> floodplain. *Appropriate use* is any activity compatible with the risk
> to natural and human resources located in the floodplain. It is the
> operation of an overall program of corrective and pre- ventive
> measures for reducing flood damage, including watershed manage- ment
> practices, emergency preparedness plans, floodplain management
> regulations, and flood control works. Floodplain management
> incorporates many of the political, social, and economic factors that
> directly affect the severity of floods with respect to the damage and
> choices involving what methods to employ in limiting this damage
> (USEOP, 1994).
>
> Deciding which flood control alternative to use in any specific water-
> shed is a very important decision within the larger framework of
> floodplain management. Any general flood control approach might
> include structural methods, nonstructural methods, or a combination of
> both. Examples of structural methods include channel modifications
> (channelization), reser- voirs, diversions, and levees or dikes. Those
> methods that seek to modify the damage susceptibility of developed
> regions within a floodplain are classified as nonstructural.
> Nonstructural measures include floodplain land acquisition (also
> commonly referred to as voluntary relocation or property buyouts),
> land use restrictions (zoning), flood proofing, flood warning systems,
> drain- age maintenance programs, and public awareness or information
> programs. One of the most beneficial aspects of a nonstructural
> approach to flood control is its greater utilization of the benefits
> provided by the natural flood- plain discussed earlier in this
> section. However, economically quantifying the total value of these
> benefits has proven to be a very difficult task. Accu- rately valuing
> environmental amenities continues to be the subject of much debate
> (NRC, 1999a). It is generally agreed that an established standard for
> assigning a dollar cost to specific amenities, such as wetlands,
> bottomland hardwoods, riparian forest, and green space, would provide
> a much-needed quantification of the indirect benefits provided by
> nonstructural measures. However, there are often too many widely
> differing variables from location to location to make the
> establishment of a general, and thus easily imple- mented, standard
> (or metric) very likely. Nevertheless, a variety of methods to measure
> environmental costs and benefits have been established, such as
> contingent valuation, the benefit-transfer method, and hedonic pricing
>
> (NRC, 1999b).
>
> Nonstructural approaches are not new, and there are several outstand-
> ing success stories where flooding has been controlled without major
> chan- nelization or other major structural controls. The Woodlands
> near Houston (Bedient et al., 1985) and Indian Bend Wash in Scottsdale
> (City of Scotts- dale, 1985) are two excellent examples where
> recreational areas and deten- tion ponds were used to better manage
> the floodplain, as urban development continued. However, some of the
> difficulties previously mentioned have lim- ited the widespread
> implementation of these methods.
>
> **Structural Methods for Flood Damage Reduction**
>
> The United States has pursued, throughout much of its history, the
> mostly singular course of attempting to control floods through the use
> of structures (Reisner, 1993; Smith and Ward, 1998). The structural
> approach's rise to dominance began in the 1930s with the passage of
> the 1936 Flood Control Act and the creation of the Federal Crop
> Insurance Corporation. This action placed the federal government in
> the lead with respect to the nation's efforts to control flooding as
> well as the compensation of its victims. By 1940, the
>

> **STRUCTURAL AND NONSTRUCTURAL METHODS OF FLOOD CONTROL**
>
> government had assumed the full cost of building and maintaining dams,
> channel modifications, and rectification projects for all navigable
> waters of the United States (USEOP, 1994). Advances in the fields of
> fluid mechanics, hydrologic systems, statistical hydrology,
> infiltration, evaporation analysis, and flood routing throughout the
> 1940s made the goal of designing and con- structing large-scale
> control structures well within the reach and extremely effective
> (Chapter 1).
>
> Structural alternatives include channel modifications in a variety of
> forms: the use of reservoirs or detention/retention ponds to retard or
> contain flood flows; the construction of levees or floodwalls to
> contain flows within a designated floodway; and diversions to redirect
> flood flows to an alternate, off-channel floodway or detention pond.
> Each of these methods is viable under certain conditions and has
> associated advantages and disadvantages (Mays, 2001). The failure of
> levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina exemplifies the
> importance of choosing appropriate structural methods to protect from
> all reasonable conditions. A brief description of these types of
> structural alternatives follows.
>
> **Flood Control Reservoirs**
>
> Flood control reservoirs provide an effective means of managing and
> con- trolling flood flows. These basins can range from as simple a
> structure as a small pond planned alongside a highway or road culvert
> to a large reservoir with control structures designed to hold extreme
> volumes of water. Regard- less of their size, all reservoirs serve the
> same function of providing addi- tional storage to attenuate the peak
> flow experienced during a storm event (Chapter 9).
>
> Flood control reservoirs can be divided into two basic types,
> detention and retention. Detention reservoirs or ponds are designed to
> hold runoff for a short period before releasing it to the natural
> watercourse. Retention ponds are designed to hold runoff for extended
> periods, usually for aesthetic, agricultural, consumptive, or other
> uses (Chow et al., 1988). Chapter 9 includes an example of a standard
> detention pond design used in small urban watersheds. Extremely large
> retention structures are also referred to as stor- age reservoirs.
> These storage facilities are associated with large dams and are often
> not created solely for flood protection but also for water supply.
>
> The beneficial reduction of peak runoffs and resulting flood
> protection afforded at a particular point on a stream by a reservoir
> depends primarily on the fraction of the watershed area above the
> protected point, which is governed by the location of the reservoir
> structure. This reduction is progres- sively reduced as runoff from
> the watershed area below the reservoir becomes appreciable and the
> distance downstream of the reservoir increases. This distance varies
> and is dependent upon watershed characteristics such as the number and
> size of tributaries and the shape of the watershed. To be effective, a
> reservoir site must be available not too far upstream. This may
>
> serve as a significant advantage over other types of flood control,
> since a smaller reservoir may be constructed just upstream of a
> flood-prone loca- tion, providing adequate flood protection while
> limiting excavation costs and environmental impact.
>
> However, reservoir location may serve as a disadvantage when large-
> scale protection is desired and location sites are limited, since
> extremely large reservoirs are required to provide significant
> downstream protection. The reservoir option provides particularly
> limited protection against large storm events in areas where both the
> overland slope and natural channel are small (USACE, 1996). Other
> significant drawbacks include finding locations to dispose of
> excavated material and aesthetic concerns when the con- structed pond
> is not being used for flood control (see also Chapter 9).
>
> **Channel Modifications and Environmental Impacts**
>
> Channel modifications are performed to improve the conveyance
> character- istics and carrying capacity of a natural stream. A natural
> channel's convey- ance and capacity can be improved by altering one or
> more of the dependent hydraulic variables of channel slope, depth,
> width, and roughness (Brookes, 1989). The resulting increased
> hydraulic efficiency of the "improved" chan- nel results in increased
> flow velocities, which in turn result in reduced flood stages or water
> surface elevations for a given storm event.
>
> These modifications, often referred to as "channelization," have been
> extensively used throughout the United States for decades with
> effective results (Smith and Ward, 1998). This technique is especially
> common as a flood control measure for meandering streams of the south
> and southeastern coastal plains (Brookes, 1988). However, the
> channelization approach has always been clouded in controversy, since
> in certain cases the associated harmful effects on the environment may
> exceed benefits. Channelization permits the control of flooding in

> the next few decades; however, there can be no denying the near-imme-
> diate and broad-reaching impact this report would have on
> channelization projects (A. D. Little, 1973).
>
> The Little report in 1973 stated that the direct benefits of the chan-
> nelization projects it studied were, in fact, conservatively
> estimated. It con- cluded that the vast majority of flood channel
> modifications were performing as designed and that the approximate
> \$15 billion invested, to date, nation- wide in channel modifications
> for flood protection was reducing annual dam- ages by \$1 billion.
> Some projects, however, were underdesigned and failed to provide
> adequate flood control effectiveness for their original design storm.
> Channel projects near Houston, such as the Brays and White Oak bayous,
> were originally designed to handle large storm events, but capacities
> were greatly reduced as the development of the floodplain was
> encouraged (Hoblit et al., 1999). Another serious issue, seen recently
> in Houston but also in other large cities, is the net effect of
> channelization on downstream com- munities. As flows are channeled
> more quickly with development, they often increase the peak flows from
> upstream tributaries and exacerbate the condi- tions downstream. Other
> channel modifications were severely overdesigned, ill conceived, or
> otherwise not properly planned and engineered so that the significant
> environmental impacts far outweighed the flood control benefits they
> provided.
>
> The Little report indicated that many environmental effects of channel
> work must be carefully considered before implementing any
> channelization scheme. These include:

-   Drainage of neighboring wetlands;

-   Cutting off of oxbows and stream meanders;

-   Lowering of ground water levels, resulting in reduced stream
    > recharge;

-   Clearing of floodplain bottom-land hardwoods and destruction of
    > wildlife habitat;

-   Increased erosion of stream banks, leading to stability problems;

-   Increased downstream deposition of silt and sedimentation;

-   Increased downstream flooding as a result of increased upstream
    > velocities;

-   Impacts on the stream's and receiving body's aquatic life;

-   Reduced aesthetics and loss of visual amenity.

> The Little report's findings shifted the focus of future research in
> the 1970s toward the development of improved science and technology to
> quan- tify the extent of the environmental impacts of channelization.
> Through the next two decades, scientific research concerning the
> impacts of channeliza- tion ranging from hydraulic to environmental
> appeared in a wide variety of publications.

> **Diversion Channels, Levees, and By-Pass Channels**
>
> Diversions are used to reroute or bypass a portion of the flood flow
> away from a flood-prone area. This results in reduced peak flows at
> the area of interest. The method only provides downstream protection,
> and the amount of protection diminishes downstream in a similar
> fashion to reservoirs. Diversions are often used in conjunction with
> off-line (away from the main channel) reservoirs, as the diverted
> flows must still be contained and/or passed around the area of
> concern. Their significant drawback is that suffi- cient right-of-way
> must be available to contain or direct the diverted flows into
> neighboring basins.
>
> Levees are linear structures, often consisting of earthen embankments
> or reinforced concrete walls, built parallel to the main stream with
> the pur- pose of containing a specified design overbank flow. These
> structures are often located very near the natural floodway and on
> both sides of the river, providing protection to the entire natural
> floodplain. This alternative is con- sidered the oldest and most
> widespread type of localized flood defense worldwide, including the
> United States, and plays a fundamental role in flood control. Levees
> increase the local carrying capacity of the channel and are intended
> to prevent all flood damage to the adjacent river corridor until the
> water level exceeds the top of the structure. Their most significant
> draw- back is that if overtopped, flood damage is incurred as if the
> structure did not exist. Given the historical trend of development
> within the floodplain (especially with the additional sense of
> security provided by the floodwalls), damages often exceed what would
> have occurred without the levee. Addi- tional drawbacks include
> increased downstream flow rates and resulting increased downstream
> flood damages, significant right-of-way requirements, notable
> environmental impacts similar to channelization, and others (NWF,
> 1998). A rare combination of weather events led to the midwestern
> flood of 1993 that breached many levees along the Mississippi River.
>
> The floods of 2011 were the newest in the series of floods that has
> caused to the Mississippi basins. Early estimates were that damage
> costs could reach around \$4 billion dollars. Much of the damages were
> caused to crop lands that were inundated from the opening of spillways
> in order to save cities such as Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans,
> Louisiana. In contrast to the 1993 floods, the 2011 event had the
> added component of the melting of heavy winter snows in addition to
> the excessive rainfall (Drye, 2011). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
> decided to open the three post
>
> 1927 flood spillways: the Morganza Spillway located 186 miles upriver
> from New Orleans, the Bonnet Carre Spillway located about 33 miles
> above New Orleans, and the Bird Point Spillway located in Missouri.
> This is the first time in history that all three of these spillways
> have been open at the same time and was done in order to save New
> Orleans from possible floods that could have been worse than those
> caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Rioux, 2011).
>
> More recently, the discussion of levees returned to the forefront of
> public discussion after Hurricane Katrina impacted the coastal city of
> New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005. The unprecedented damage, in both
> lives and dollars, experienced during this natural disaster was partly
> due to the failure of the levee system designed to protect large
> portions of the city. As a result, questions as to the methodology,
> implementation, and adequacy of this flood damage reduction
> alternative quickly arose. More information about Hur- ricane Katrina
> and its impact on New Orleans is provided in Section 12.5.

>
> **Nonstructural Methods for Flood Damage Reduction**
>
> Nonstructural measures are used to reduce the damage potential of a
> struc- ture or facility within the floodplain by adjusting the use of
> flood-prone lands to the flood hazard. This approach contrasts starkly
> with its structural coun- terpart, which instead attempts to minimize
> the flood hazard by actually altering flood flows (Mays, 2001). The
> amounts of reduction in damage potential achieved by nonstructural
> measures vary significantly, depending on the mechanism implemented.
>
> There exist a wide variety of nonstructural flood controls, including
> (USEOP, 1994):

-   Flood proofing;

-   Flood warning mechanisms;

-   Land-use controls such as zoning and development ordinances;

-   Flood insurance programs;

-   Flood preparedness activities;

-   Public awareness and education programs;

-   Existing primary and secondary drainage system maintenance;

-   Acquisition of floodplain land or voluntary flood-prone property
    > buyouts.

> Nonstructural methods have only recently been given serious
> consideration as a primary means of reducing flood damages, although
> their potential usefulness has been researched for over 50 years.
> Alternative options to structural methods were perhaps first
> articulated by White in 1945. In the 1950s, the Tennessee Valley
> Authority, with its broad mandate for water- management
> experimentation, proved an effective pilot program for many
> nonstructural measures with promising results. Additionally, the
> nonstruc- tural movement was somewhat popularized by Leopold and
> Maddock in 1954 as well as by Hoyt and Langbein in 1955, resulting in
> professional inter- est and the involvement of the American Society of
> Civil Engineers in the development of a Guide for the Development of
> Flood Plain Regulations. However, it was in 1966 that a concerted
> effort to integrate nonstructural measures into federal flood control
> policy would take place.
>
> A 1966 Presidential Task Force on Floodplain Regulations, charged with
> making recommendations for improving the existing federal flood con-
> trol policy, highlighted five basic objectives for developing a
> unified national program for managing flood losses. These were:

-   Improve the basic knowledge about flood hazards at both the local
    > and regional level;

-   Improve planning and coordinating of all new developments in the
    > floodplain;

-   Improve technical services available to floodplain managers;

-   Create a national program for flood insurance;

-   Allow for the future adjustment of federal flood control policy to
    > changing needs.

> The Task Force report spurred action to develop uniformity in
> floodplain management strategies across a myriad of federal agencies,
> including the Soil Conservation Service and the COE. Additionally, an
> important result of the report was the creation of the NFIP through
> the Flood Control Act of 1968.
>
> In 1998, the NWF completed a report, *Higher Ground,* which addressed
> two of the most important nonstructural issues affecting
> floodplains---repetitive flood losses under the NFIP and voluntary
> property buyouts. These issues are addressed in the next two sections.
>
> **The National Flood Insurance Program**
>
> In response to the failure of the private sector to provide
> reasonable, cost- effective flood insurance to the average buyer, the
> NFIP was created by the Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NWF, 1998). This
> program was designed to provide cost-effective insurance to property
> owners who live within the 100- year floodplain in communities that
> have established a minimum standard of hazard mitigation provisions.
> The goal, in principle, was simple: Allow the insurance premiums and
> not the general taxpayer to cover the cost of flood
>
> damages. The required mitigation provisions would enforce floodplain
> development regulations, guidelines, and limitations. The NFIP was
> placed under the cognizance of the newly formed FEMA in 1979.
>
> The program has enjoyed some success. Flood insurance premiums covered
> \$10.4 billion in losses and program expenses between the years 1977
> and 1997 (NWF, 1998). As an additional benefit, the program has
> stimulated additional floodplain management concepts and programs
> throughout the country.
>
> However, the program has experienced major shortcomings in the form of
> policy and financial distortions, repetitive loss properties, poor
> enforcement of regulations pivotal to the success of the program, and
> sig- nificant inaccuracies in floodplain delineations (NWF, 1998).
> Many oppo- nents of the plan argue that it has actually encouraged
> development and rebuilding in high-risk areas with the promise of a
> "limitless guarantee" of governmentally sponsored bailouts.
>
> The existence of repetitive loss properties (RLPs) is a drain upon the
> efficiency and effectiveness of the program (NWF, 1998). Although com-
> prising only 2% of the properties insured, these properties are
> responsible for nearly 40% of the program's payments. The City of
> Houston is ranked number three on the Top 200 Repetitive Loss
> Communities Rankings by payments. The city has an estimated 2030 RLPs
> with total payments in excess of \$114 million (NWF, 1998). The shear
> enormity of flood damages in 2004 and 2005 strained the NFIP to an
> unprecedented level, causing multiple insurance companies to declare
> bankruptcy and general insurance costs to increase.
>
> Despite this evidence that the NFIP is not the singular flood control
> answer, its advantages and effectiveness are far reaching. The program
> has spurred an ever-increasing awareness of the benefits of a sound
> flood mitiga- tion strategy and even highlighted the environmental
> benefits of the flood- plain when put to its natural use.
>
> **Voluntary Buyouts of Flood-Prone Property**
>
> The buyout of high-risk floodplain properties from willing sellers and
> the relocation of at-risk buildings and structures out of the
> floodplain are non- structural alternatives that have received
> increased attention in recent years (NWF, 1998). The catastrophic
> midwest flood of 1993 along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, as
> well as several resulting postflood studies and recom- mendations,
> spurred national interest in this particular alternative. The
> essentials of the voluntary buyout program are clearly stated in
> *Higher Ground* (NWF, 1998).
>
> The overall goal of this alternative is simple to achieve in theory
> but very difficult to achieve in practice. Theoretically, a one-time
> expenditure of public funds would result in the evacuation of a
> specified floodplain area. This cost, although significant, would
> result in the complete elimination of
>
> flood risk for those areas. Ideally, the long-term financial benefits
> (in the form of reduced flood losses and an increase in environmental
> benefits) would more than compensate for the initial cost.
>
> *Higher Ground* lists the ideal goals of a well-planned voluntary
> buyout program. These include:

-   Seek and secure a combination of federal, state, and local funds for
    > one-time buyouts of high-risk properties from willing sellers;

-   Ensure the return of the purchased property to its natural
    > floodplain state;

-   Pass legislation that would prohibit the expenditure of any future
    > disaster assistance to that location;

-   Provide assistance to former property owners and tenants to move to
    > higher ground and out of harm's way, and, as appropriate, relocate
    > homes and businesses outside the floodplain.

> This type of program has specific advantages over structural flood
> con- trol options as well as many other nonstructural methods. Perhaps
> its great- est benefit is that it provides permanent disaster relief
> and help to at-risk people and property. Other strong points include
> the fact that proper imple- mentation of this plan would end an
> unlimited disaster relief obligation on public funds by putting tax
> dollars to the most cost-effective use possible. Lastly, the program
> would truly realize the environmental benefits of the floodplains by
> restoring them to their natural ecological functions and thereby
> provide many of the benefits listed earlier.
>
> Buyouts are not without limitations and drawbacks. Buyout programs can
> reduce the local tax base by forcing businesses and significant
> investors to "look elsewhere"---namely, to other communities. Improper
> regulatory enforcement or the lack of a sound land management plan
> after the buyouts may result in renewed development pressure, forcing
> a change in local regu- latory laws that would once again allow
> floodplain development. Many buy- out plans have been criticized as a
> method of driving low-income residents out of a central, often
> desirable, part of a community, paving the way for future upscale
> developments. Lastly, significant costs, time, and careful plan- ning
> are required to successfully implement a buyout plan, regardless of
> its scope. The fact that buyouts involve significant changes in
> land-use patterns, often within well-established areas of a community,
> may present insur- mountable legal, social, and economic difficulties
> that force the decision- making process toward a more conventional
> structural method (NWF, 1998).

> While precipitation amounts associated with Hurricane Katrina were not
> insignificant, the majority of flood-related damages have been
> attributed to Katrina's formidable storm surge. Katrina's massive size
> and strength while over the shallow waters of the Gulf enabled its
> associated storm surge to reach 24--28 ft along a 20-mile-wide swath
> centered roughly on St. Louis Bay in Mississippi. The complete
> devastation of buildings and other infra- structure in the immediate
> vicinity of the storm-surge impact, along with widespread failures of
> tide gages, makes exact estimates of the storm surge very complicated.
> It is known, however, that elevated water levels associated with the
> storm surge reached 6 miles inland in many areas and up to 12 miles
> inland along bays and rivers.
>
> While the storm surge was highest east of the path of the eye of
> Katrina, a significant storm surge was also experienced west of the
> point of land-fall. This resulted in a 14- to 17-foot surge up the
> Mississippi River as well as the man-made Mississippi River--Gulf
> Outlet (MRGO). These two waterways converge at a particularly narrow
> part of the Industrial Canal or Inner Har- bor Navigation Canal
> (IHNC). This "funnel" effect likely intensified the surge, resulting
> in levee overtopping. At the same time, surge entered Lake
> Pontchartrain from the east through various passes and, aided by
> easterly winds, raised the water level of the lake by 10 to 12 ft. The
> rising waters due to this surge and the failure of levees were the
> primary causes behind the widespread flooding experienced by New
> Orleans.
>
> **Flood Damage Reduction Strategy for New Orleans:**
>
> **A Pump and Levee System**
>
> The city of New Orleans is surrounded by over 14 miles of levees and
> flood- walls called the Hurricane Protection System, which buffers the
> city from water-level changes in both Lake Pontchartrain and the
> Mississippi River. This system protects a low-elevation "bowl" between
> these two water bod- ies, reaching as low as 9 ft below the sea level
> in the residential areas near the lake.
>
> When the surge hit New Orleans, several problems with the levees were
> revealed. Although the levees were engineered to withstand a category
> 3 hurricane such as Katrina, the surges that hit the city were more
> consistent with a category 5 hurricane, as the funneling effect of the
> MRGO and other existing hydraulic connections drastically increased
> water velocities and, to a lesser extent, increased the storm-surge
> heights. More specifically, the Hur- ricane Protection System was
> breached in approximately 50 different places. The first 4, and the
> most devastating, of these 50 breaches were from founda- tion
> failures, as the fast-moving storm surge eroded structural support for
> the levee floodwalls. The remaining 46 breaches were from a direct
> overtop- ping of earthen levees and embankments (Fig. 12--4c).

> **Impacts and the Effectiveness of Flood Damage Reduction Strategies**
>
> Katrina was the third deadliest hurricane on record, surpassed only by
> the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane of
> 1928. The official death toll had reached 1836 by May of 2006, with
> 1296 of those in Louisiana and 238 in Mississippi. More than 250,000
> people were dis- placed by the storm, with evacuees seeking shelter in
> all 50 states, but pri- marily in Texas.
>
> The indirect damage estimates from Katrina consist of long-term eco-
> nomic effects that will continue to impact the region for years. The
> oil indus- try was most severely impacted, with crippled pipelines,
> flooded refineries, and damaged, adrift, or capsized oil rigs and
> platforms reducing the daily oil production by 95% immediately after
> the storm. The mass population exo- dus along with millions of lost
> jobs has severely hurt the local economy and caused a major loss of
> tax revenue.

> The flood control paradox discussed earlier is very relevant in this
> case study. At the time of publication of this text, the question
> "Should we rebuild?" will has been answered, and the rebuilding of New
> Orleans will likely continue into the future. Changes are in place

> city, including improvements to the pump and levee system,
> improvements in the skill of predicting hur- ricane storm track and

> nation's vulnerability to natural disasters.
>
> On August 28, 2008, a tropical wave formation, and what would become
> Hurricane Ike, moved off the coast of West Africa. The wave developed
> into a hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 12--5), and after
> reaching its peak intensity as a category 4 storm of 145 mph and 935
> mb on September 4, Hur- ricane Ike made landfall at the Bahamas on
> September 7. On September 8 and 9 the storm made landfall twice in
> Cuba, and by September 11 Hurricane Ike was in the Gulf of Mexico as
> an unusually large category 2 hurricane with a wind field 450 miles in
> diameter (Fig. 12--5). Hurricane Ike made landfall at Galveston,
> Texas, as a category 2 storm on September 13 at 2:10
> [a]{.smallcaps}.[m]{.smallcaps}. CDT with winds of 110 mph and a
> central pressure of 950 mb (Bedient et al., 2011). The damaging storm
> surge during Ike, which may have been worse than expected due to the
> storm's abnormally large wind field, motivated the NWS to enhance its
> analysis and prediction of storm surge and to develop effective ways
> of communicating the associated risks to the public. The National Hur-
> ricane Center's probabilistic storm surge product, which became
> operational in 2009, is one example of this effort (NHC, 2010).

> **IMPROVED STRATEGIES TOWARD FLOOD MANAGEMENT**
>
> The continual increase in flood-related damages, whether resulting
> from tropical storm activity or severe thunderstorms associated with
> more fre- quent frontal activity, illustrates the need to improve our
> flood management strategies at all geographic scales, from local to
> national. Improvements in weather forecasting skill and local efforts
> that rely on structural methods of flood protection will continue to
> play a vital role in reducing flood damages; however, the increasing
> population along coastal areas and in larger, urban centers demands a
> greater reliance on nonstructural methods in both short- and long-term
> flood management strategies. Many cities across the nation are
> participating in Low Impact Development (LID) practices to control
> runoff volume and pollutant loading. More information on the many
> differ- ent approaches to LID is summarized in the next section. A
> different, but equally impactful nonstructural approach that has
> worked successfully in Houston, Texas, is the Rice University/Texas
> Medical Center Flood Alert System (Rice/TMC FAS). The Flood
> Alert/Warnings Systems sections will discuss the role that flood alert
> systems can play in improving flood manage- ment strategies,
> particularly in quickly responding urbanized watersheds. Many other
> radar-based systems are in operation around the United States and
> abroad.
>
> **Low Impact Development (LID)**
>
> The utilization of LID designs is meant to decrease the adverse
> hydrologic effects of construction and urbanization on a given
> watershed and to allow the given area to best mimic predevelopment
> hydrology. LID has recently become very popular for managing urban
> runoff, and there are many differ- ent categories of practices,
> including but not limited to conservation designs, structural and
> landscape designs to increase infiltration, filtration practices to
> treat runoff, and runoff conveyance practices.
>
> Two common LID methods that contribute not only to decreasing rainfall
> runoff but also to filtering rainfall are known as pervious pavement
> and vegetative swales. Both work off of the same principle: replacing
> imper- vious cover, such as concrete, with pervious surfaces that
> allow for rain to percolate through a soil medium acting as a filter
> and flow out of the area at a slower rate. Pervious pavement replaces
> traditional impervious concrete or asphalt with a pervious concrete
> paver that is placed on top of layers of other materials, which
> facilitate the movement of rainfall to a series of drains placed under
> the pavement that transport the percolating water to a desired
> location (ICPI, 2010). Vegetative swales work in a similar manner,
> with the main difference that the swales are self-contained planters
> that typically receive runoff directly from roofs or an impervious
> surface such as the road. The runoff that is collected then percolates
> through the soil medium found in the vegetative swale and is
> discharged at a desired location (PBES, 2011). Another LID practice
> that can be implemented is a rainwater catch- ment system. These
> systems collect water from a catchment surface, such as a roof,
> through a series of gutters, and the water is piped into a large
> cistern for storage. This technique aids not only in decreasing the
> effects of urban- ization on runoff, but also in arid and
> drought-stricken areas; it can be used
>
> to harvest rain water that can be used for drinking water (Mays,
> 2011).
>
> In addition to on-site green infrastructure, conservation designs are
> built on the scale of a neighborhood to preserve open space in order
> to increase either infiltration or evapotranspiration. Higher-density
> development is one method that attempts to accomplish this goal by
> grouping populations in a smaller space, such as a high-rise apartment
> building, in order to vacate other areas that may be used for parks
> and other types of open space. For instance, 4 single-family homes in
> suburbia may occupy one acre of land, whereas apart- ments may take up
> the same amount of space and house 10 or more families. Additionally,
> because the soil on a single-family plot of land is compacted by heavy
> machinery, lawns often behave like impervious surfaces (USEPA, 2006).
> In fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has shown that
> larger lawns do not compensate for the increased runoff that is
> created when a watershed is developed (USDA, 2001). Instead, utilizing
> open space for pocket wetlands, forestry, and parks can help attenuate
> flow and reduce the volume of runoff in a watershed. The San Antonio
> Water System is a good example of how legislation can be used to
> control stormwater runoff and increase the water resources in a
> community. The organization has designated Floodplain Preservation
> Areas, which are located within the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone, to
> limit the amount of activity that is allowed. Furthermore, Floodplain
> Buffer Zones run parallel to the Floodplain Preservation Areas and
> only contain pervious cover (SAWS, 1995). More information on water
> resources in San Antonio can be found in Chapter 13.
>
> LID can have a powerful effect when a number of different techniques
> are combined together in a designated area such as a planned
> community. The Woodlands is a 37-yr-old totally planned community
> north of Houston,
>
> Texas, that, when originally designed in the 1974, used many
> techniques that were precursors to the LID designs we see today. The
> master drainage plan of the development was planned from the beginning
> to minimize any adverse impacts on the 100-yr floodplain. The
> development criterion was to mini- mize any change in the existing,
> undeveloped floodplain at two central points. More than one-third of
> The Woodlands was designated as open space, and is either found in its
> natural state or maintained for recreational use, parklands, or other
> community facilities. Also, to minimize the impact of urbanization on
> the peak runoff response, the drainage system was main- tained in its
> natural state as much as possible to provide higher storage capacity
> and resistance to flow within the channels. Drainage into the major
> water courses is provided by numerous broad, shallow swales with
> slopes generally less than 1%, and they are covered in native
> vegetation to impede stormwater flow (Bedient and Huber, 2002).
>
> **Flood Alert/Warning Systems**
>
> Flood alert/warning systems are becoming more prevalent as tools to
> reduce the flood damage susceptibility of critical areas in watersheds
> throughout the United States. These systems are designed to collect,
> handle, analyze, and disseminate hydrologic information, ideally in
> real time, for the purpose of providing accurate advance warnings of
> an impending flood condition. Their incorporation in existing and
> newly developed flood management strategies should be encouraged. An
> increase in the use of these types of systems is likely, given the
> following factors: the continued growth of com- puter-mediated voice
> and data communication systems, including the Inter- net and
> data-capable wireless devices; the increased availability of
> high-quality hydrologic data, including radar rainfall, LIDAR
> elevation datasets, and GIS-formatted hydrography; and the overall
> resurgence of the nonstructural flood control method as a tool to
> complement flood damage reduction strategies.
>
> Recent technological advances in hydrology and in a number of other
> fields, such as meteorology and computer science, have made available
> a variety of tools capable of increasing the performance of a flood
> alert system. This is particularly true for alert systems designed for
> quickly responding urban watersheds. Some of these advances include
> the continued research in the application of Next Generation Radar
> (NEXRAD), the development of more accurate short-term Quantitative
> Precipitation Forecast algorithms, the development of powerful yet
> efficient distributed parameter and lumped parameter hydrologic models
> that run in real time, and the linkage of all of these advances within
> the ever-improving GIS field (Bedient et al., 2003; Fang et al.,
> 2008).
>
> The above-listed factors have permitted these types of systems to
> successfully issue flood warnings at specific locations with
> increasing lead time at even the small, urban watershed scale. Once
> installed in these
>
> watersheds, and accepted as part of a flood management system, time-
> critical actions that may result in significant costs to both public
> and private organizations can be taken only when necessary and with
> ample time to minimize flood damages.
>
> Traditionally, warnings provided by the NWS for watersheds on the
> order of 100 square miles or less are issued as blanket statements for
> broad areas such as a county or quadrant of a county. These warnings
> are issued quite liberally with the aim of "failing safe"; however,
> the downside to this approach is the frequent false-alarm ratio that
> results, making the public skeptical and hesitant to take action in
> response to future warnings. Further- more, where small-scale warning
> systems do exist as part of an ALERT (Automated Local Evaluation in
> Real Time) System, these systems are typically rain gage based. While
> these gage-based flood alert systems have fulfilled the role of
> providing flood notification to many people and have undoubtedly saved
> millions in both lives and property, they fail to take advantage of
> many of the above-listed technologies to improve lead times and system
> accuracy.

> **The Rice/Texas Medical Center Flood Alert System**
>
> The original FAS was an integrated system that gathered NEXRAD data
> from the NWS and extracted rainfall totals over the Brays Bayou
> watershed in southwest Houston, Texas (Bedient et al., 2000; Vieux and
> Bedient, 1998). It used this information to provide flood forecasts
> for a single location in the bayou near the Texas Medical Center---the
> world's largest medical complex, consisting of numerous hospitals,
> hotels, restaurants, public transportation systems, and medical
> schools. The area is prone to flooding, owing to its location in the
> downstream portion of a nearly completely urbanized water- shed called
> Brays Bayou. This bayou and the TMC have been impacted by two major
> floods and several minor floods over the past 25 years.
>
> Most urban alert systems operated by local emergency management
> agencies still rely solely on an often limited number of rain gages
> and stream
>
> gages to provide notifications. For example, the Harris County Office
> of Emergency Management ALERT system still maintains a strict reliance
> on rain gage/stream gage for dissemination of warnings. While its
> network is perhaps one of the densest in the world, with approximately
> 1 rain gage per 10 square miles, the system remains a classic reactive
> vs. proactive alert system---waiting until at least 2 in. of rainfall
> is detected by a rain gage and a corresponding stream flow gage nearby
> has verified increasing flow in the appropriate watershed prior to
> issuing an alert. This type of reactive approach, while almost never
> issuing a false alarm, is capable of providing only about 30 minutes
> or less of lead time (Bedient et al., 2003).
>
> **The Second-Generation Flood Alert System (FAS2)**
>
> The second generation of the Rice/Texas Medical Center Flood Alert
> Sys- tem, known as FAS2, has been developed with the aim of addressing
> many of the shortfalls of the original system. This process has
> focused on utilizing many advances in the fields of radar sensing,
> real-time hydrologic modeling, and improved information transfer via
> digital systems such as the Internet, PDAs (personal digital
> assistants), and cell phones. Four general areas were identified where
> the existing system could be improved: lead time, accuracy,
> effectiveness, and reliability.
>
> Color-coded flood alert action levels were created for various flow
> levels predicted by the FAS for Brays Bayou at Main Street. The alert
> status was based on nomograph-predicted flows. A flood caution
> (yellow) would be issued for predicted flows between 20,000 ft^3^/s
> and 24,000 ft^3^/s. A height- ened alert status (orange) would be
> issued for predicted flows between 24,000 ft^3^/s and 28,000 ft^3^/s,
> when flooding would be considered possible, given additional rainfall
> over the watershed. A final alert status (red) would be issued for
> predicted flows greater than 28,000 ft^3^/s, signifying that severe
> flooding at the TMC would be probable, given the combination of
> existing flow in the Bayou and current rainfall estimates.
>
> The animated radar rainfall images were available at various time
> peri- ods and scales. For example, end users could request the last 24
> hrs of radar rainfall over the entire southeast Texas area and then
> select the last 3 hrs of detailed data specifically over Brays Bayou.
> These images were routinely used to analyze historical storm movement
> as well as to obtain a qualitative feel for the growth and decay
> trends for individual storm cells.
>
> The FAS's two cameras, called BayouCams, enabled constant visual
> monitoring and verification of flow levels at vital confluences. Prior
> to their installation, TMC security personnel were dispatched to
> physically observe these levels. The images from the BayouCams were
> archived during signifi- cant storm events, providing valuable data
> for post event analysis and system performance evaluation.
>
> Improving the accuracy of the system was accomplished by a variety of
> means, including improved radar data input and resolution, real-time
>
> calibration of the radar with rain gages when available, and the
> development of real-time hydrologic models---both distributed and
> lumped parameter. A real-time interface for the industry-standard
> HEC-1 hydrologic model was developed, permitting the hydrologic
> predictions developed by these models to take greater advantage of the
> spatial and temporal distribution of real- time radar data. This
> real-time hydrologic model also provides significant lead-time
> improvements by providing estimates of when peak flows would actually
> occur.
>
> Information dissemination tools besides the Internet were added to the
> new system, including automated notification via cellular phones,
> pagers, and e-mail. New alert action levels were developed to
> incorporate the increased lead time and accuracy from the new system.
> This had the desired effect of reducing the number of false alarms to
> the TMC. Lastly, the system was tested from start to finish over a
> number of actual storm events. The system has worked very well for 10
> major storms since 2001 with an observed vs. predicted r^2^ value of
> 0.90 FAS2 has generally predicted floods with aver- age differences of
> 0.88 hr for time of peak and 3.6% in peak flows for the overall
> performance. System reliability was also improved by establishing
> multiple server sites at various locations, including Rice University,
> TMC, and Norman, Oklahoma (Fang et al., 2008).
>
> **The Third-Generation Flood Alert System (FAS3)**
>
> The advanced radar-based flood alert system (FAS) has evolved through
> two generations using available technologies and enhancements and has
> played an important role in flood warning and flood control aspects
> for the Texas Medical Center since it debuted. After years of
> urbanization in the watershed, the hydrologic model as a core engine
> in the system has been updated with recent routing information and
> loss rate factors to provide more reliable prediction information.
>
> The system has been recently upgraded into its third generation (fas3.
> flood-alert.org) by incorporating a hydraulic prediction
> tool---Floodplain Map Library (FPML) so that mapped warning
> information in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Google Maps
> can be provided to emer- gency personnel in real time. The FAS3 system
> employs Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) technology to reduce
> web traffic while allow- ing for more timely display of updates. The
> web browser can periodically check with the server to see if an update
> has occurred. In this way, more frequent checks can be performed for
> shorter durations, which is very important for end users under severe
> weather conditions. In addition, with the popularity of Google
> Maps---a web mapping service application and technology provided by
> Google---the FAS3 system displays the FPML within the Google Maps
> frame (FAS3.rice.edu). When rainfall occurs in the watershed, the FAS3
> algorithm determines a floodplain according to a rain- fall intensity
> estimate that is computed over the last 3 hrs of radar rainfall
>
> data. Rainfall estimates are updated whenever the FAS3 server receives
> new data. Showing colored floodplain mapping information in Google
> Maps enables emergency personnel to better understand weather condi-
> tions during any event (Fang et al., 2011).
>
> Chapter 12 introduced essential information concerning floodplain
> management is- sues, flood control alternatives, and flood control
> policy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), the primary agency in
> charge of these issues at the national level, was introduced, and
> several aspects of the agency were discussed. Specifically, the
> chapter focused on recent changes in flood control practice, which are
> now being adopted by the COE. These changes, often in the form of
> encompassing more non- structural flood control measures, have enabled
> a broader and more environmentally conscious approach to floodplain
> management.
>
> Specific examples of both structural and nonstructural flood control
> measures have been presented for the reader to more fully appreciate
> the advantages and disadvantages of each when used in any floodplain
> management scheme. A heavy emphasis was placed on the environmental
> impacts associated with channelization. Additionally, floodplain
> property buyouts and the NFIP were presented as two vi- able
> nonstructural flood control alternatives to traditional, structural
> approaches. The role of the FEMA in flood disasters was briefly
> discussed.
>
> The chapter presents a detailed treatment of Hurricanes Katrina and
> Ike and their enormous impact along the Gulf coast. In particular,
> Katrina created the great- est flood damage (over \$75 billion at time
> of printing) ever seen in a major metro- politan area (surpassing T.
> S. Allison in Houston in June, 2001). Hurricane Ike, the first major
> direct hit on Houston since 1983, damaged more than 2500 homes and
> displaced large numbers of people, while generating the third highest
> damage in his- tory (\$24.9 billion) (Bedient et al., 2012). These
> storms demonstrate the power and fury of Mother Nature in spite of the
> millions that have been spent over the years on floodplain management
> and levee construction, especially in New Orleans.
>
> The chapter concludes with a section on improved strategies for flood
> manage- ment, including low impact development methods and flood
> warning systems. These methods hold great promise for the future to
> help promote sustainable watersheds.

> **734**
>
> The next generation of modern hydrologists will face unprecedented
> chal- lenges in dealing with the evaluation and investment in existing
> water resource projects as well as the development of new and
> innovative ones. This chapter explores some world-renowned water
> resources projects that demonstrate hydrologic applications at the
> highest level of achievement. These include projects for the water
> systems in central Texas, the Colorado River basin, and international
> projects on the Thames River near London and in China and Southeast
> Asia.
>
> Central Texas is a prime example of a region facing issues at both
> ends of the spectrum. The complex ground water aquifer system has very
> little long-term storage capacity. Drought, coupled with
> ever-increasing popula- tion growth in the region, has forced water
> managers to address conservation and look toward alternative water
> supply sources to maintain a sustainable system. This region is also a
> part of flash flood alley, an area where the high- est rainfall and
> runoff rates in the country contribute to dangerous flooding. Major
> water projects have been developed to respond to these challenges.
>
> The City of San Antonio, home to 1.3 million people, lies in the midst
> of central Texas. The San Antonio River, running directly through the
> city's
>
> downtown, is one of the premier examples of structural flood control
> used to expand economic opportunity. Levees, dams, tunnels, and sluice
> gates have all been built to control the river and to protect
> downtown. The San Antonio Riverwalk and expanded river reach are
> examples of sustainable water development projects that have become
> the center of a robust tourist economy and the livelihood of the city.
>
> Water issues in the western United States far exceed those of central
> Texas and are some of the most complex in the world. Over 20 million
> people rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and irrigation,
> and much of the
>
> U.S. food supply is produced from farms that use this water. However,
> this unruly source has only recently been tamed. The seven western
> states that rely on the Colorado River came to an agreement in the
> 1920s over the divi- sion of the Colorado River's water, but today the
> annual flow of the river is over allocated. The Colorado River is one
> of the most heavily dammed, reg- ulated, and litigated rivers in the
> United States and serves as a prime example of how important water
> resources are to the fabric of life and culture.
>
> The greatest and most successful dam project on the river was the
> Hoover Dam built in the 1930s. Not long after, Glen Canyon Dam was
> built to guarantee water to the Upper Basin States. Hoover Dam has
> been a great success for many reasons, but Glen Canyon Dam has proven
> to be more of an environmental disaster. Not only has it greatly
> affected flows and wildlife in the Grand Canyon National Park, but its
> reservoir has inundated one of the most awe-inspiring canyons on the
> Colorado River. Internationally, dams have led to heated discussions
> and often their negative effects can outweigh the benefits of
> construction.
>
> The Thames River in England is an example of a coastal river system
> that faces both water quality issues and flooding problems.
> Historically, the Thames River has been contaminated with sewage
> effluent from London for hundreds of years. More recently, a modern
> sanitary sewer system has been designed that carries sewage away from
> the river. Additionally, the Thames River is vulner- able to severe
> flooding from upstream snowmelt and rainfall, as well as tidal
> movements and storm surge. Engineers have installed and designed a
> storm surge barrier to protect London's infrastructure and population.
>
> China is a major developing economy that has enormous water supply,
> flooding, and water quality problems. Many of its rivers have been or
> are being dammed for flood control in many regions, and already there
> have been serious environmental and sediment issues. The recent
> opening of Three Gorges Dam in 1994, the largest in the world, is not
> without a host of problems. The Chinese government also admitted the
> dam has negatively impacted downstream river water, sediment
> transport, and migration of citizens (Kent, 2011).
>
> The above water resources projects provoke a series of important
> questions that puzzle modern engineers: To what extent are we able to
> tame and reroute rivers to serve our needs? How high and how big must
> we build before we become a danger to ourselves? At what point have we
> consumed all the renewable resources in our aquifers? How far must we

> The City of San Antonio is the seventh largest city in the United
> States. It is home to 1.3 million people and is the largest city to
> rely solely on ground- water to sustain its population. The unique
> early history of the city sets the stage for the development of an
> economic metropolis located directly on the San Antonio River.
> Although the city receives approximately 29 inches of rain annually,
> rainfall can vary anywhere from 10 to 52 inches in a given year. In
> some years, riverbeds run practically dry causing citizens to worry
> about the state of the aquifer and triggering usage restrictions.
> However, in other years the river flows out of banks wreaking havoc
> and destruction.
>
> Water managers and policy makers in the City of San Antonio have been
> forced to address conservation, flood abatement, and sustainable urban
> planning in a region that relies heavily on a fractured limestone
> aquifer for its major water supply and a river prone to flooding for
> its economic vitality. San Antonio's proven success in conserving and
> managing water has made it a national leader in water supply
> management. For example, the River- walk and expanded river reach is
> one of the most successful water resources projects in the United
> States and has motivated similar development inter- nationally.
>
> **A Brief History of Water Use**
>
> Not long after the Spanish Conquistadores began arriving in Texas in
> 1691, they discovered that the area around what is today San Antonio
> could be a potential colonial frontier north of Mexico and a permanent
> stronghold against French expansion from Louisiana. By the early
> 1700s, the Spanish had built five missions along the banks of the San
> Antonio River, which became the largest concentration of Catholic
> missions in North America (Fig. 13--1).
>
> The missions acted as centers for military, religious, and cultural
> instruction of the native Indians, and the ranching practices
> developed by the Spaniards at the missions later became the basis for
> the U.S. agriculture and cattle industries. One agricultural technique
> used by the Spaniards was to transport water using a series of
> irrigation ditches, dams, and aqueducts known as acequias (Fig 13--2).
> Seven acequia systems linked the five missions creating a 15-mile
> network that was capable of irrigating 3500 acres. This was the first
> municipal water distribution system in the lower 48 states and
> continued to serve as the city's sole water system for almost two
> hundred years (Eckhardt, 2011). Even today, parts of the system are
> still in use.
>
> San Antonio is best known for the historic Battle of the Alamo, where
> a few dozen defenders held their ground while Mexican soldiers laid
> siege to the mission. In the end, Texas gained its independence from
> Mexico at San Jacinto near Houston in 1836, and was annexed into the
> United States in

> 1845\. After the Civil War in 1865, Texas longhorn cattle became
> prized for their hardy nature, and over the two decades immediately
> following the War, cattle drives were a common site throughout the
> state. Cowboys were able to lead the cattle north through Texas,
> Oklahoma, and Kansas for over 20 years, due to ample water supplies
> along the trails. The last big drive was in 1885 when a severe winter
> followed by drought forced many to sell their animals.

> In early 1901, oil was discovered in Texas, and the East Texas Oil
> Field turned out to be massive and oil wells sprang up overnight.
> Further investigation revealed that much of the state sat on oil
> reserves, and the race for the black gold began, an industry very
> dependent on a rich source of water.
>
> In the 1890s, a prominent figure in San Antonio, George Brackenridge,
> observed that spring flows were fluctuating wildly corresponding to
> the amount of rainfall. He was concerned that the springs were not a
> sustainable source of water for the growing population. In response,
> he drilled major artesian wells on his property near the headwaters of
> the San Antonio River, and other citizens began drilling wells due to
> a drought that greatly reduced spring flows. The abundant underground
> resource and the improvement in well drilling methods at the turn of

> **The Edwards Aquifer**
>
> The Edwards Aquifer is the major aquifer serving central Texas and San
> Antonio. About 200 million years ago, central Texas was covered by a
> shallow sea. As this sea oscillated back and forth, the Edwards
> limestone formation was exposed to the elements. During the late
> Cretaceous Period, sediments were deposited on top of the exposed
> rock, trapping the water in the crevices between the old and new
> limestone and forming the Edwards Aquifer. About 70 million years ago,
> wind deposited even more sediments on top of the Edwards formation,
> and the weight of the sed- iments caused faults to form between the
> Edwards Plateau and the Gulf of Mexico. The most visible expression of
> these faults is the Balcones Escarpment which marks the transition of
> the Gulf Coast Prairie to the Texas Hill Country.
>
> Some of the most extreme rainfall-runoff rates in the country occur
> along the Balcones Escarpment. As streams flow across the permeable,
> frac- tured carbonate rocks, their base flow seeps through the rocky,
> clay layer and into the conduits of the recharge zone, an area of
> approximately 1250 square miles (EAA, 2011). Beneath the surface of
> the recharge zone, water flows into the artesian zone of the aquifer.
> Here, the water is under so much pressure between limestone confining
> units that it can reach the surface without pumping, in the form of
> artesian wells or springs. In parts of the aquifer these springs
> seldom go dry, while in others their flow varies greatly from year to
> year. Average groundwater velocities can range from 27 feet/ day to
> 6000 feet/day depending on the region of the aquifer (Ardis and
> Fahlquist, 2004).
>
> Today, the Edwards Aquifer lies beneath eight counties, including the
> more heavily populated Bexar, Comal, Hays, Uvalde, and Medina Counties
> (Fig. 13--3). It covers an area of approximately 3600 square miles and
> is 180 miles long and anywhere from 5 to 40 miles wide (SAWS, 2011).

> The Edwards Aquifer serves approximately 2 million people in Central
> Texas.
>
> The demographics of the region above the aquifer include farm and
> ranch- land, urban metropolises, and industrial sectors, as well as
> tourist and recreational areas along the rivers and springs. The
> aquifer also supplies water to major Texas cities, including San
> Antonio, serving an estimated 2 million people in 2010 (EAA, 2011).
> Annually the aquifer is expected to yield approximately 0.45 million
> ac-ft of water (Donahue and Klaver, 2005). Aquifer water quality is
> generally good, but there are some issues of concern.
>
> The aquifer's capacity has been estimated to be about 173 million
> ac-ft of water. It is considered one of the most productive
> groundwater
>
> systems in the United States (EAA, 2011). However, because the aquifer
> is artesian, water levels are highly dependent on the amount of annual
> rainfall. In years with heavy rainfall, the water flows freely from
> springs, but during long droughts, the activity in the aquifer
> decreases and the economic and environmental costs of pumping water
> from the aquifer increase significantly.
>
> **Alternative Sources of Water**
>
> The Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) projects that the population
> served by the aquifer will grow from 1.9 million in 2010 to 3 million
> by 2050 and that annual demand will reach 0.5 million ac-ft. Such
> projections have led to seri- ous discussions over the future
> availability of the water resource and the need for long-term resource
> planning, including the diversification of water resources. The San
> Antonio Water System (SAWS) has led the charge, developing a 50-year
> water plan that identifies ways to create long-term water storage,
> employ recycling and conservation goals, and develop alterna- tive
> water sources.
>
> One of the most groundbreaking water resource developments was the
> creation of the Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) facility
> by SAWS. Completed in 2004, at a total cost of \$255 million, the
> facility is located in the Carrizo Aquifer. Water can be injected into
> the sand aquifer, creating a bubble or dome that can be accessed later
> when there is a shortage of water in the Edwards Aquifer. During wet
> years, water is pumped from the Edwards Aquifer into the Carrizo
> Aquifer and stored at the ASR facil- ity. Then, during drought
> periods, the water is returned to the distribution system to meet
> demand. Unlike a surface water reservoir, no water evapo- rates.
> Estimates are that more than 0.1 million ac-ft of water can be stored
> at the facility (SAWS, 2011).
>
> The city has been using recycled water to cool electrical generating
> plants since 1963, and by the year 2000 San Antonio had the nation's
> largest recycled water distribution system (Eckhardt, 2011). More than
> 80 miles of pipeline can provide about 20% of the city's total water
> capacity. Recycled water is supplied to commercial and industrial
> customers for non-potable uses, such as irrigation and cooling, and
> used to supplement base-flow in creeks and streams as well as the San
> Antonio Riverwalk. SAWS has taken the initiative to educate the public
> about the uses of recycled water, encour- aging them to conserve and
> heightening awareness about water shortage issues in the area. This
> effort has been complimented by the development of more efficient home
> appliances and landscaping. Since 1987, despite a 50% increase in
> water users, there has been no increase in water consump- tion (SAWS,
> 2011).
>
> Despite conservation initiatives, the Edwards Aquifer does not have
> the capacity to solely supply the city's water in the future. SAWS has
> looked to the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) in Texas to
> supplement
>
> water supply by piping water from the Lower Colorado River to San
> Anto- nio. The equivalent of 50% of annual withdrawals from the
> Edwards Aqui- fer could be drawn across the pipeline (Earl and
> Votteler, 2005). In 2001, SAWS and LCRA reached an agreement, allowing
> San Antonio to purchase 150,000 ac-ft of water from LCRA for up to 80
> years. The project was esti- mated to cost about \$1 billion, but by
> 2008 the estimated cost of the project had increased by another \$1
> billion and the maximum projected yield decreased to 90,000 ac-ft.
> Then in 2009, the LCRA predicted that regional population growth made
> supplying additional water to San Antonio unfea- sible. By May, SAWS
> declared that the LCRA was in breach of contract and ended all
> discussions.
>
> SAWS has also proposed that by 2060 one alternative may be to desal-
> inate ocean water and pipe it back to San Antonio. However, the
> economic and environmental costs are enormous and the feasibility of
> such a project would need to be further explored. Many other aquifer

> **Edwards Aquifer Management and Protection**
>
> A major drought encompassed much of the United States from 1950--1956,
> beginning in the Southwest and covering 10 states by 1954 (NCDC,
> 2003). In Texas, drought conditions were so severe that the aquifer
> fell to the low- est levels ever recorded. Some farmers reported that
> rain had not fallen on their property for more than seven years and
> the San Marcos Springs, the largest artesian springs in Texas, ran
> completely dry, leading to intense con- cern over the future
> availability and management of the Edwards Aquifer as a water
> resource.
>
> Water managers rely on monitoring wells to measure pressure within the
> aquifer. One of the well records, the J-17 Index Well in San Antonio,
> has been used since 1956 as an indicator of the health of the aquifer.
> The J-17 well is located on a major flowpath of the aquifer and thus
> responds quickly to pressure changes from pumping or recharge.
> Similarly, the levels in the J-17 well can be related to major
> artesian spring flows such as the Comal Springs and San Marcos Springs
> (Fig. 13--4). The absence of spring flow causes rivers to run dry and
> lake levels to decrease dramatically, and aquifer depletion can also
> cause severe environmental damage to the underground ecosystem. The
> Edwards Aquifer is home to many freshwater species of salamander,
> catfish, shrimp, and other organisms, eight of which have been placed
> on the endangered species list.
>
> Historically, the Aquifer was subject to "right of capture" laws,
> allow- ing anyone with wells drilled into the aquifer to use unlimited
> water supplies. This has led to significant depletion of the resource,
> especially as the vol- umes drawn from the aquifer continually
> increase. In 1993, Senate Bill 1477 established the EAA to manage,

> In 1998, the EAA mandated water-use cutbacks to address reduced spring
> flows and alarmingly low aquifer levels for the first time. By 2007,
> the EAA had developed a multiphase plan to reduce aquifer withdrawal

> Although the EAA mandates the percent withdrawal reduction, it does
> not determine how the cutbacks are met by the individual users. Cities

> hot, dry air to central Texas and virtually eliminating the hope for
> any rain early in the year. In July 2011, the EAA had declared Stage
> II drought restrictions (SAWS, 2011). The severity of this drought

> **Flash Flood Alley**
>
> Texas is accustomed to month- or year-long droughts, leading to
> intense water shortages throughout the state, as discussed in the
> previous sections. However, in some years, intense rainfall exceeding
> 10 inches per day leads to significant flooding. In fact, central
> Texas often receives most of its annual rainfall in a few large events
> rather than steady precipitation throughout the year. Thin soils,
> exposed bedrock and sparse vegetation, as well as steep slopes,
> produce some of the highest runoff rates in the country, making the
> Texas Hill Country the most flash flood-prone area in the United
> States.
>
> The IH-35 corridor, spanning from Dallas to San Antonio, has been
> appropriately named Flash Flood Alley. Streams and rivers receiving
> runoff from the Texas Hill Country compounded with heavy rainfall
> cause massive flooding in the flat, gulf coast plains. Between 1959
> and 2005, 760 flood- related deaths occurred in Texas, ranking it the
> number one for flood-related fatalities, injuries, and casualties
> (Ashley and Ashley, 2008).
>
> In central Texas, peak discharges occur much more quickly than in
> other watersheds due to the slope and intensity of rainfall, catching
> residents off guard and putting them in the way of the flood.
> Floodplain maps are often subject to political pressures and may be

> The San Antonio River has always been a unique resource for the city

> and water quality (Fig. 13--6).
>
> The vitality of the San Antonio River is tied closely to the health of
> the aquifer and the amount of rainfall in a given year. The headwaters
> of the river originate at the Blue Hole, a famous spring north of
> downtown San Antonio. From there, the river passes through downtown

> In the 1890s, when the citizens of San Antonio began relying on arte-
> sian and shallow wells for their water supply rather than surface
> water, the river level was significantly depleted. In response, the
> mayor of the City of San Antonio created the City Planning Committee
> in 1910 and began re- beautification efforts along the river banks.
> There were three primary pro- posals for beautifying the river, and
> the combination has created the basis for the Riverwalk today:

1.  Thirteen miles of stone bridges and park along the river,

2.  Channelize the river near downtown to control for flooding,

3.  Build the shops along the river near downtown San Antonio designed
    > to create a Venetian-like atmosphere to stimulate economic growth
    > in the heart of San Antonio.

> Re-beautification efforts met serious opposition when, between 1914
> and 1921, six major floods occurred in downtown San Antonio. The worst
> of these occurred in 1921, when parts of downtown were inundated by as
> much as 10 feet of water. Significant loss of life and property
> prompted city officials to propose cementing over the river and
> turning it into a piped sewer system to prevent downtown from future
> floods. Luckily, the citizens of San Antonio protested and took other
> measures to protect downtown from flooding.
>
> Olmos Dam was completed in 1926 at the cost of \$1.5 million and was
> built to contain water accumulating in the Olmos Creek watershed north
> of downtown. The area behind the dam has been turned into park and
> recre- ational facilities that flood during heavy rainfall. With a
> spillway length of 1152 feet, the dam was designed to hold vast
> quantities of water. There are six floodgates to release water into
> Olmos Creek at the downstream side of the dam, which provide
> significant protection for areas of northern San Antonio. In 1929, the
> city completed a second flood control measure: the cutoff channel. The
> cutoff channel was designed to allow floodwaters to bypass the "Great
> Bend" portion of downtown and is controlled by a series of flood-
> gates located at the entrance and exit to the great bend. When the
> river reaches a certain stage, the gates are closed and the water is
> diverted away from downtown. This portion of the river is home to
> shops and restaurants that act as the city's main downtown attraction.

> The most impressive engineering accomplishment in the City of San
> Antonio was a tunnel 140 feet beneath the city that diverts
> floodwaters before they reach downtown and the Riverwalk, controlling
> the river stage in the downtown area. The project was completed in
> 1997 at the cost of \$111 million. The tunnel runs for 3 miles beneath
> the city and carries water down- stream where wider channels can
> handle the excess floodwaters. The tunnel functioned perfectly during
> both the 1998 and 2002 storms when 30 inches of rainfall fell on the
> city in 48 hours. Had the tunnel not been in place at the time of the
> storm, the damage to the city could have been catastrophic.

> In 1996, the San Antonio River Improvements Project was initiated.
> Approximately 13 miles of river, from Brackenridge park to the last
> mission in South San Antonio, is being restored at the cost of \$358
> million. Engineers and urban planners re-evaluated floodplain extents
> and designed a green space consisting of pocket parks, paddling and
> bike trails, and wildlife habi- tat to provide flood storage and a
> recreational outlet for citizens. The unique culture of the city of

> The river begins in the mountains of Colorado, flowing through the

> President Theodore Roosevelt began federal reclamation of the Amer-
> ican Southwest by enacting the Reclamation Act of 1902 (USBR, 2006).
> The theory was to "reclaim" the arid lands for human use through
> irrigation (www.usbr.gov). The Act created the means for federally
> funded irriga- tion projects by setting aside money from the sale of
> public land, which would be used to build and maintain irrigation
> works in the western 13 states. The newly irrigated lands encouraged
> people to move west where they could grow crops on fertile soils,
> relying on a steady source of water. The irrigated land, now more
> valuable, was sold and the money put back into the revolv- ing
> irrigation fund (Loring, 2004).
>
> Reclamation was not an easy fix to conquering the west, as the unruly
> river and erratic flows provided many irrigation challenges in the
> early 1900s, especially in the lower stretches of the river. Flow in
> the Colorado is highly variable, fluctuating between 6 and 20 million
> ac-ft annually (Carriquiry and Sanchez, 1999). Peak flows coincide
> with the spring snow melt, but during other times of the year its flow
> can be much lower, limiting its ability to irrigate all the dependant
> farmland. Also, the violent spring floods require sufficient and
> expensive levees to contain and direct the water, while at the same
> time the highly turbid water deposits enormous amounts of sediment. It
> was estimated that the river in its natural, red-colored state carried
> 160 mil- lion tons of sediment each year (Carriquiry and Sanchez,
> 1999). This massive load of sediment clogged man-made canals after a
> large flood, and required expensive repairs each time.

> Aside from flood control problems, water salinity is the biggest water
> quality issue in the Colorado, and can result in completely useless
> water. Salinity concentrations in the headwaters of the Colorado are
> less than 50 mg/L, but concentrations increase downstream
> dramatically, reaching about 900 mg/L near the Mexico border
> (pubs.usgs.gov). Many of the miner- als come from the saline soils in
> the high plains of Colorado and Arizona, but agricultural irrigation
> also is a significant contributor. In fact, water flow- ing in the
> lowest reaches of the river has been re-used, on average, three times
> for irrigation purposes, allowing it to leach more minerals from the
> soil and become more saline (Fradkin, 1996). Urbanization, population

> A commission was created in August 1921 and was headed by the

> affected by the construc- tion of the Hoover Dam: Colorado, Wyoming,

> states debated extensively over water allocations, but could not
> settle on an agreement. By Hoover's suggestion, an agreement was
> finally reached that apportioned the water between two groups, the
> Upper and the Lower Basin States. This put forth the movement to
> establish the first water rights on the river, and water rights for
> the individual states would be allocated in future agreements. The
> Colo- rado River Compact, also referred to as the Hoover Compromise,
> was signed in 1922 officially dividing the basin into two parts near
> the Arizona/Utah border (USBR, 2006).
>
> The compact allotted to each basin 7.5 million ac-ft of water to be
> used for beneficial consumptive purposes each year. This volume of
> water was then to be divided among the states in each basin. On
> October 11, 1948, the states in the Upper Basin signed the Upper
> Colorado River Basin Compact. Colorado was given the largest sum of
> water with 51.75%, Utah with 23%, Wyoming with 14%, and New Mexico
> with 11.25% (USBR, 2006). The Lower Basin States, however, were unable
> to willfully reach a compromise, and a suite was filed in the U.S.
> Supreme Court in 1952 by Arizona. Arizona asked for the Supreme Court
> to determine how the river's water should be divided among the three
> lower states. Finally, in 1964 a decree was established by the Court

> Having established the water rights among the basin states, the USBR
> could now choose a location to build the dam. After exploring 70

> depth to the bedrock eased excavation, the dam at Black Canyon would
> store the same amount of water at a lesser height, and the geological
> structure of the area was deemed more favorable for construction (Fig.

> In June 1931, workers began diverting the Colorado River. Four diver-
> sion tunnels 56 feet in diameter and nearly 3 miles in total length
> were blasted through the walls of the canyon (USBR, 2006) (Fig.
> 13--9). When the tunnels were completed in November 1933, engineers
> redirected the flow of the river using two temporary cofferdams made
> of rock and earth to lift the water into diversion channels. The upper
> cofferdam was built just below the opening of the four tunnels to
> divert the flow of the Colorado River down the tunnels. On November
> 14, 1932, the flow of the Colorado River successfully wound its way
> around the work site, and the task of excavating the construction site
> began.
>
> Engineers were tasked with designing spillways, intake towers, pen-
> stock and outlet systems, and powerhouse and switching stations as
> well to hydroelectric generation. These components were no less
> important and very often no less difficult to construct than the dam
> face. The spillways located on each side of the dam were responsible

> were present in Lake Mead, the reservoir created behind Hoover Dam. At
> capacity, the concrete lined chan- nels running 650 feet long and 125

> It was also necessary to design a way to move the water from Lake Mead
> through the Hoover Dam. Engineers designed a series of intake tow- ers
> and penstocks that would pull water from the reservoir through 41 feet
> tunnels lined with 2 feet of concrete and massive thick plate steel
> pipes. The intake towers sat on ledges that were cut out of the canyon
> approximately 260 feet above the river bed in order to provide a basin
> for silt settling. The towers would be connected to tunnels that would
> drop 200 feet straight down and connect to a series of underground
> tunnels that flowed into the dam.

> within two months the crest was reached. In less than five years, two

> back 22.5 tons of pressure at the base of the dam, and weighs a
> staggering 6,600,000 tons (Fig. 13--10). Lake Mead became the largest

> **Glen Canyon Dam**
>
> After the construction of the Hoover Dam, the government needed to
> pro- vide a means with which water could be regulated to ensure that
> the Lower Basin and Upper Basin states would receive their rightful
> allotments of water. After negotiating with the Sierra Club regarding
> multiple dam sites, Congress authorized the Colorado River Storage Act
> on April 1956, which ensured the delivery of allotted water
> downstream. The construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in northern
> Arizona began on June 1960, and the final concrete was poured on
> September 1963. The Glen Canyon Dam towered over the landscape at 710
> feet tall, and created a reservoir, Lake Powell, with 26 million ac-ft
> of storage stretching over 186 miles of the Colorado River that took
> 17 years to fill. The Glen Canyon Dam is infamous for the serious
> environmental damage it has caused (www.usbr.org).
>
> David Brower, the executive director of the Sierra Club at the time of
> completion, called the Glen Canyon Dam "America's most regretted
> environmental mistake." In fact, Glen Canyon was one of the most beau-
> tiful canyons along the Colorado River before it was inundated with
> water (Fig. 13--11). Post-construction, numerous environmental
> concerns have arisen. For instance, under natural conditions the flow
> through the Grand Canyon would range between 3000 and 90,000 cubic
> feet per second and carry massive amounts of silt. Now that the Glen
> Canyon Dam is regulat- ing water flow, the annual flows range between
> 8000 and 20,000 cubic feet per second and are virtually sediment free
> (livingrivers.net). The natural high and fluctuating flows served as a
> conveyor of sediment to build beaches, rejuvenate and replenish the
> shorelines, as well as create sand- bars that supported calm,
> backwater areas for fish to utilize, while the low flows were
> essential in juvenile fish survival. Instead, the fluctuating, often
> lower, sediment-free flows seen erode the sand bars and allow
> vegetation to encroach upon areas that are not naturally vegetated.

> Glen Canyon Dam is wasteful of significant volumes of water each year.
> Lake Powell alone loses 2600 gallons of water per minute to

> reservoirs account for a 10% loss of flow (glencan- yon.org). In a
> region that relies heavily upon the Colorado River for multiple
> purposes, water lost to evaporation is simply unsustainable.

> In 1983, a greater than average snowmelt caused significant flooding

> **ACROSS THE POND---THE RIVER THAMES**
>
> The Thames River, one of the most famous in all of Europe, flows 205
> miles from the Thames Head, in the Cotswold Hills, through Southern
> England before emptying into the North Sea near London. It is the
> longest river in England and drains approximately 5500 square miles.
> The last 65 miles of the river are an estuary where the salt water
> fresh water barrier fluctuates daily. In London, the incoming tide can
> raise the river up to 7 meters during the spring, reversing its flow
> through the estuary (Encyclo- pedia Britannica, 2011).
>
> Historically, this river suffers from overuse and neglect. Runoff from
> waste and sewage has severely contaminated the river for decades, a
> prob- lem that has only recently been addressed by authorities. In
> addition, severe storms in the North Sea can inundate London with
> storm surge. Storm surge is the phenomena brought on by high winds and
> shallow bathymetry when a wall of water is pushed ahead of a storm and
> onto land. To combat these issues, engineers have constructed a series
> of water resource projects that mitigate the effects of contamination
> and flooding.
>
> Much of the early Victorian sewer network is still in use today for
> the movement of water and contaminants, but as London continues to
> grow, the system becomes ever more taxed. During heavy rains, the
> sewer system overflows, affecting plant and animal life and presenting
> a serious human health risk. The Thames Tideway Scheme is a project
> currently in progress that introduces two new storage-and-transfer
> tunnels as well as capacitance improvements to three wastewater
> treatment plants. The tunnels will reduce overflow into the River
> Thames and Lee, moving it to the treatment facilities instead. The
> Thames Tunnel is to be constructed between 2013 and 2020. It
>
> will be more than 20 miles long and 25 feet in diameter, flowing
> parallel to the River Thames. The tunnel is designed to remove 96% of
> the sewage entering the Thames annually (NRI, 2011).
>
> **Flooding and the Barrier**
>
> Floods on the River Thames often occur because of large storms,
> upstream flooding, extreme tidal movement, or severe storm surge. The
> combined effect of any of these can be catastrophic. In 1928, 14
> people died when all four causes occurred simultaneously (Encyclopedia
> Britannica, 2011). Snow- melt and unusually heavy rainfall coupled
> with spring tides and storm surge filled London's streets with four
> feet of water. Thousands of people lost their homes and the city's
> infrastructure was significantly damaged.
>
> In 1953, another major storm in the North Sea damaged the English
> coastline and sea walls. Floods carried entire structures out to sea,
> leaving 24,000 properties seriously damaged. In the United Kingdom,
> 300 people died because of the storm. These significant events, along
> with smaller ones, prompted the construction of the Thames Barrier,
> the world's second largest movable flood barrier (completed in 1982).
> Built downstream of London, it spans 1700 feet across, and protects
> over 33,000 acres from flooding (Envi- ronment Agency, 2011a).
>
> The Thames Barrier is made up of 10 steel gates, 65 feet high. There
> are two types of gates: falling radial gates and rising sector gates.
> The falling radial gates are situated above the non-navigable portions
> of the river while the rising sector gates rest on the river bed,
> allowing ship traffic to pass. The gates can be maneuvered into four
> positions: open, closed, under spill, and maintenance. The entire
> structure can be readied for flooding within 90 minutes (Environment
> Agency, 2011a).
>
> The flood barrier protects significant infrastructure, including his-
> torical landmarks, government buildings, businesses, schools,
> hospitals, etc. However, it leaves the entire downstream Thames
> estuary vulnerable to severe storms. Estuaries have significant
> capacity to store storm surge and help mitigate the effects of severe
> storms. In 2002, England established the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan, a
> flood risk management plan that takes into consideration climate
> change and socioeconomic change. The Plan would allow the river to
> reclaim its floodplain near the estuary to reduce the impacts of
> flooding in London (Environment Agency, 2011b). This non- structural
> alternative reflects opinions of water managers worldwide and is one
> effort to consider the true future impacts of climate change in

>
> Despite the incredible electric capacity of these dams, they have been
> heav- ily protested. After leaving China, the Mekong River flows for

> flood reverses the flow in the Tonle Sap contributing to its

> Often structures can exacerbate the impacts of natural disasters. For

# Properties of Water

> The principal physical properties of water are summarized in Table
> C--1. They are described briefly below.
>
> **SPECIFIC WEIGHT**
>
> The specific weight of a fluid, g, is the gravitational attractive
> force acting on a unit volume of a fluid. In SI units, the specific
> weight is expressed as kilo- newtons per cubic meter (kN/m^3^). At
> normal temperatures, g is 9.81 kN/m^3^ (62.4 lb/ft^3^).
>
> **DENSITY**
>
> The density of a fluid, r, is its mass per volume. For water, r is
> 1000 kg/m^3^ (1.94 slug/ft^3^) at 4°C. There is a slight decrease in
> density with increasing temperature. The relationship between g, r,

> The viscosity of a fluid, m, is a measure of its resistance to
> tangential or shear stress. In SI units the viscosity is expressed as
> newton-seconds per square meter (N-s/m^2^).
>
> **DYNAMIC VISCOSITY**
>
> In many problems concerning fluid motion, the viscosity appears with
> the density in the form m r, and it is convenient to use a single term
> n, known as the kinematic viscosity. The kinematic viscosity of a
> liquid, expressed as square meters per second (m^2^/s) in SI units,

> Surface tension of a fluid, s, is the physical property that enables a
> drop of water to be held in suspension at a tap, a glass to be filled
> with liquid slightly above the brim and yet not spill, and a needle to
> float on the surface of a liquid. The surfacetension force across any
> imaginary line at a free surface is proportional to the length of the
> line and acts in a direction perpendicular to it. In SI units, surface
> tension is expressed as newtons per meter (N/m). There is a slight
> decrease in surface tension with increasing temperature.

> **SURFACE TENSION**

> Vapor pressure is the partial pressure exerted by gas phase molecules
> that are in dynamic equilibrium with a liquid or solid. This means
> that the rate of evaporation of the gas is equal to its rate of
> condensation. The pressure ex- erted by this gas, or vapor, is known
> as the vapor pressure r~n~. In SI units the vapor pressure is
> expressed as kilopascals (kPa) or kilonewtons per square meter
> (kN/m^2^). Vapor pressure increases with decreasing intermolecular
> forces and increasing temperature.

>
> V*flo*™ is a physics-based distributed model that preserves the
> spatial variation of slope, hydraulic roughness, infiltration, and
> rainfall input within a gridded representation of the watershed. The
> model uses a numerical solu- tion of the kinematic wave equations to
> simulate overland and channel flow from rainfall runoff. Gridded
> parameters are derived from geospatial data and physical
> characteristics defining soil infiltration/moisture, channel and
> overland hydraulics, and rating curves. High-resolution rainfall rates
> from radar or rain gage sensors allow detailed predictions within the
> drainage network compris- ing the watershed. The desktop edition of
> V*flo*™ is used to setup and calibrate the model for continuous or
> event-based simulation. In continuous simulation using long-term radar
> rainfall input covering days, months, or years, V*flo*™ generates a
> time series of discharge, runoff volume, and soil moisture for watch
> points. The continuous model may be configured to output distributed
> maps of discharge and stage, or infiltration depths for recharge
> studies. Optional mod- ules for V*flo*™ provide functionality such as
> Inundation mapping, Automatic Calibration, Parameter Sensitivity, and
> spatially and temporally dynamic design storms. V*flo*™ can be run in
> real-time for hydrologic prediction of discharge or stage/inundation
> depths. Real-time applications include flood warning and emergency
> notification.
