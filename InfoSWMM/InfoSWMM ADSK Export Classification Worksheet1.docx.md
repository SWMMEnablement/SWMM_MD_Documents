Glossary

<span id="Authentication" class="anchor"></span>**Authentication:** Authentication includes all aspects of access control where there is no encryption of files or text except as directly related to the protection of passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or similar data to prevent unauthorized access.

<span id="ContouringCntl" class="anchor"></span>**Contouring control**: Two or more “numerically controlled” motions operating in accordance with instructions that specify the next required position and the required feed rates to that position. These feed rates are varied in relation to each other so that a desired contour is generated

<span id="CryptoAct" class="anchor"></span>**Cryptographic Activation:** Any technique that activates or enables cryptographic capability, via a secure mechanism that is implemented by the manufacturer of the item and is uniquely bound to the item or customer for which the cryptographic capability is being activated or enabled ( e.g., a serial number-based license key or an authentication instrument such as a digitally signed certificate). Cryptographic activation techniques and mechanisms may be implemented as hardware, software, or technology.

<span id="Development" class="anchor"></span>**Development:** “Development” is related to all stages prior to serial production, such as: design, design research, design analyses, design concepts, assembly and testing of prototypes, pilot production schemes, design data, process of transforming design data into a product, configuration design, integration design, layouts.

<span id="EncryptionComponent" class="anchor"></span>**Encryption Component.** Any encryption commodity or software (except source code), including encryption chips, integrated circuits, application specific encryption toolkits, or executable or linkable modules that alone are incapable of performing complete cryptographic functions, and is designed or intended for use in or the production of another encryption item.

**Encryption Object Code.** Computer programs containing an encryption source code that has been compiled into a form of code that can be directly executed by a computer to perform an encryption function.

**Encryption Software**. Computer programs that provide capability of encryption functions or confidentiality of information or information systems. Such software includes source code, object code, applications software, or system software.

**Encryption Source Code**. A precise set of operating instructions to a computer that, when compiled, allows for the execution of an encryption function on a computer.

<span id="InfoSecurity" class="anchor"></span>**Information security:** All the means and functions ensuring the accessibility, confidentiality or integrity of information or communications, excluding the means and functions intended to safeguard against malfunctions. This includes “cryptography,” “cryptographic activation,” ‘cryptanalysis,’ protection against compromising emanations and computer security.

<span id="GovEndUser" class="anchor"></span>**Government End-User** (as applied to encryption items). A government end-user is any foreign central, regional or local government department, agency, or other entity performing governmental functions; including governmental research institutions, governmental corporations or their separate business units (as defined in part 772 of the EAR) which are engaged in the manufacture or distribution of items or services controlled on the Wassenaar Munitions List, and international governmental organizations. This term does not include: utilities (including telecommunications companies and Internet service providers); banks and financial institutions; transportation; broadcast or entertainment; educational organizations; civil health and medical organizations; retail or wholesale firms; and manufacturing or industrial entities not engaged in the manufacture or distribution of items or services controlled on the Wassenaar Munitions List.

<span id="MassMarket" class="anchor"></span>**Mass Market**: If the product sold, or will be sold, in large volume without restriction through mail order transactions, electronic transactions, telephone call or in-store transactions.

**Media**: Media is the format in which the software is delivered (i.e. CD-ROM, Dongle, DVD, tape)

<span id="Network" class="anchor"></span>**Network infrastructure:** (as applied to encryption items). A ‘network infrastructure’ commodity or software is any “end item,” commodity or “software” for providing one or more of the following types of communications:” (a) Wide Area Network (WAN); (b) Metropolitan Area Network (MAN); (c) Virtual Private Network (VPN); (d) Satellite; (e) Digital packet telephony/media (voice, video, data) over Internet protocol; (f) Cellular; or (g) Trunked. Note 1 to paragraph 2: ‘Network infrastructure’ end items are typically operated by, or for, one or more of the following types of end users: (1) Medium- or large- sized businesses or enterprises; (2) Governments; (3) Telecommunications service providers; or (4) Internet service providers. Commodities, software, and components for the “cryptographic activation” of a ‘network infrastructure’ item are also considered ‘network infrastructure’ items.<span id="OpenCryptoInterface" class="anchor"></span>

**Numerical control:** The automatic control of a process performed by a device that makes use of numeric data usually introduced as the operation is in progress

<span id="ObjectCode" class="anchor"></span>**Object Code:** An equipment executable form of a convenient expression of one or more processes (“source code” (or source language)) that has been compiled by a programming system.

**Open Cryptographic Interface.** A mechanism which is designed to allow a customer or other party to insert cryptographic functionality without the intervention, help or assistance of the manufacturer or its agents, e.g., manufacturer’s signing of cryptographic code or proprietary interfaces. If the cryptographic interface implements a fixed set of cryptographic algorithms, key lengths or key exchange management systems, that cannot be changed, it will not be considered an “open” cryptographic interface. All general application programming interfaces (e.g., those that accept either a cryptographic or non-cryptographic interface but do not themselves maintain any cryptographic functionality) will not be considered “open” cryptographic interfaces.

<span id="OpenSource" class="anchor"></span>**Open Source:** An equipment executable form of a convenient expression of one or more processes (“source code” (or source language)) that has been compiled by a programming system. Open Source is also considered “Publicly Available Source Code” (see definition below). Open source encryption source code is subject to export regulations. Examples of websites that list Open Source:

<http://www.apache.org/licenses/exports/>

<https://www.yoctoproject.org/tools-resources/export-compliance>

<http://www.bouncycastle.org/wiki/display/JA1/Frequently+Asked+Questions>

<http://www.openssl.com/export/>

<span id="Production" class="anchor"></span>**Production:** Means all production stages, such as: product engineering, manufacture, integration, assembly (mounting), inspection, testing, quality assurance.

<span id="Proprietary" class="anchor"></span>**Proprietary:** Proprietary software is computer software licensed under exclusive legal right of the copyright holder, or developed in-house without copyright.

**Publicly Available Source Code:** Source code that has been already been published for the public to use anonymously. Publicly available source code is found on company websites, open source websites or other published sources. Publicly available encryption source code is subject to export regulations. The export of publicly available encryption source code under the EAR is permitted by License Exception TSU (Technology and Software - Unrestricted). The TSU exception requires the exporter to provide the US Government with a "one-time" notification of the location of the publicly available encryption code prior to or at the time the code is placed in the public domain. Notification after transmission of the code outside the US is an export control violation.

<span id="Software" class="anchor"></span>**Software:** A collection of one or more “programs” or “microprograms” fixed in any tangible medium of expression.

<span id="SourceCode" class="anchor"></span>**Source Code**: A convenient expression of one or more processes that may be turned by a programming system into equipment executable form (“object code” (or object language)).

<span id="Technology" class="anchor"></span>**Technology:** Technology means: Information necessary for the “development,” “production,” “use,” operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, or refurbishing (or other terms specified in ECCNs on the CCL that control “technology”) of an item.

- N.B.: Controlled “technology” is defined in the General Technology Note and in the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR).

- NOTE 1 TO DEFINITION OF Technology: “technology” may be in any tangible or intangible form, such as written or oral communications, blueprints, drawings, photographs, plans, diagrams, models, formulae, tables, engineering designs and specifications, computer-aided design files, manuals or documentation, electronic media or information revealed through visual inspection;

- NOTE 2 TO DEFINITION OF Technology: The modification of the design of an existing item creates a new item and technology for the modified design is technology for the development or production of the new item.

<span id="Use" class="anchor"></span>**Use/Operation**: Operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul and refurbishing.
