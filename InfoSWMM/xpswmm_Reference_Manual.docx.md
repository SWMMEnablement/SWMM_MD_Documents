***SECTION 1: OVERVIEW  
*1.2 The Model Structure**

The xp environment maintains a loose coupling to the analytical model (engine) and graphical and textual post-processors, via text and binary data files. These data files are generated from the xp database when the "Solve" menu command is issued and from the analytical engine when the network is analyzed.

When the "Solve" command is given, xp first performs the high-level database integrity checks as described in the documentation. If these checks are passed successfully and the model data files are generated, xp then performs the task of running the analytical engine to process the data files and generate output for the graphical post-processors to use.

When the analytical engine has completed its run any errors or warnings encountered in running the model are reported and the user is placed back in the editing environment. The model results for a selection of objects can then be viewed by using several graphical tools and reviewing text output files. Several built-in functions and utilities also exist for the integration of model results and data to GIS, spreadsheets or other databases.

> **1.3 Philosophy**

An expert system is "a knowledge-based reasoning system that captures and replicates the problem-solving ability of human experts" (Boose 1986) and typically has three basic components:

- a knowledge base,

- an inference engine, and

- a working memory.

The knowledge base is "the repository for information that is static and domain-wide" (Baffaut et al 1987). The knowledge base may contain not only static data that will not change from one problem to the next, but may also contain empirical and theoretical rules, and provide advice on models that may be employed as part of the solution.

The inference engine is "the reasoning mechanism containing all the procedures for manipulating, searching, and exercising the knowledge base" (Baffaut et al 1987).

The working memory is used to solve a specific problem using the expert system. It consists of the user interface to the expert system and the storage of specific problem information. The working memory also serves as the explanation device for the expert system indicating legal and illegal data and suggesting parameters.

A computer-based expert system has advantages over a human expert that include:

- An expert may retire and knowledge is lost.

- There may be better uses of an expert's time than answering user questions.

- Expertise may be expensive to deliver.

- An expert may not be available when needed.

- An expert is not always consistent.

In any particular application these reasons or others may be important in deciding to use an expert system.

Expert systems development has created the need for a specialist called a knowledge engineer. Knowledge engineering is "the extraction, articulation and computerization of expert knowledge. Knowledge consists of descriptions, relationships, and procedures in the domain of interest" (Boose 1986). The knowledge engineer provides the interface between the human expert and the computer.

It is generally agreed that one of the largest, if not the largest, problem in expert systems development is knowledge acquisition and knowledge engineering.

XP diverges from the traditional expert system by allowing the continuous accumulation of localised expertise to be used within its shell with little assistance necessary from the software developer. The coupling of the Storm Water Management Model to the XP interface with all of its graphical tools has created a Decision Support System (DSS) for storm and wastewater management.

> **1.4 Strategy**

The graphical XP environment is, in essence, a shell that acts as an interpreter between the user and a model. The XP graphical interface provides the user with a very high-level interface to various numerical simulation programs oriented towards solving problems that may be represented as some form of link-node structure.

The main theme of this interface is Decision Support Graphics. At the front end of the interface the process of creating data for the model is made as visual as possible, with the aim of emulating real world problems as closely as possible. For example, most dialogs contain graphics that visually link the data being entered to the physical system being modelled.

7

xpswmm Reference Manual

The user is given continual guidance and assistance during data entry. For parameters that are difficult to estimate, the user may be advised of literature to aid in selecting a value, or an explanation of a parameter and some proposed values may be shown on the screen. If there are other ways to pick the value, typically, if the parameter is a function of other variables, the equation is shown to the user.

The user interface is intelligent and offers expert system capabilities based on the knowledge of the software developers and experienced users. For example, as various graphical elements are connected to form a network, XP filters the user's actions so that a network that is beyond the scope of the model is not created. This may be visible by options being disabled as prerequisite choices have not been made. For example a Hydraulics node outfall button cannot be selected unless there is at least one active conduit coming into the node and no conduits exiting the node. The general philosophy is to trap any data problems at the highest possible level - at the point the users create the data.

At the back end of the user interface the results of model analysis and design are presented graphically to maximize comprehension, assist in the interpretation of results and support decision-making.

> **1.5 Is a 2D or 2D/1D Model Feasible?**

With present day computers, there are few hardware constraints in setting up a 1D model. However, for a 2D model the first step is to decide whether it is feasible and practical to set up a model. Experienced modelers can usually quickly determine an answer by considering the following:

1.  Clearly understanding/defining the model’s objectives, and if known, the modeling budget.

2.  Determining the minimum cell size required to model the hydraulics accurately enough to meet the study’s objectives. Preferably at least three to four cells across the major flowpaths (depending on the topography). Minor flowpaths may be more coarsely or not represented if they play no significant role hydraulically in regard to meeting the modeling objectives. For example, residual water drains over a floodplain may not affect peak flood levels; in which case, it may not be necessary to model them.

3.  If it is not possible to model a major flowpath with a sufficient cell resolution, the flowpath can be modeled as a 1D branch cut through the 2D domain. This may allow a larger cell size to be used, and a greater area modeled in 2D, or a faster simulation time. For example, the river may be modeled in 1D and the floodplain in 2D.

4.  Establish possible boundary locations for the model. These are influenced by locations that are well defined hydraulically, and any constraints on the extent of the topographic data (DTM). Dynamically linking with a 1D domain offers significant flexibility in locating the 2D domain.

5.  Determine the number of rows and columns of the grid based on the overall dimensions of the 2D domain and the minimum cell size. Calculate the number of cells (rows by columns), and estimate the average number of cells that would be wet.

6.  In 2001, using a P3 1GHz computer, overnight simulations of models varying in cell size from 5m to 60m for durations of 12 to 120 hours were achieved with several hundred thousand wet cells. For large models, it may be beneficial to start with a coarser cell size to facilitate quick turnover of simulations before proceeding to a finer cell size. This is a relatively easy process as most data input is not cell size dependent. **Note that halving the cell size typically corresponds to increasing the simulation time by a factor of eight (four times as many cells and half the timestep).**

> **1.6 Analytical Engine**

The 1D-analytical engine performs all numerical computations for 1D-models. It is based on the EPA SWMM engine and has significant proprietary enhancements. When the engine is running the window displays statistics on the computational performance and progress of the simulation. Calculations may be paused (to view run time statistics) and then continued or stopped. If stopped before the assigned simulation end the model will contain full output and statistics up to the manually terminated point in time. The run time parameters for a link or node may be viewed graphically.

When the model contains 2D components, the 2D Results displays information regarding the progress of the 2D-simulation. 2D flow calculations are performed by the TUFLOW engine.

TUFLOW is a computer program for simulating depth-averaged, two and one-dimensional free-surface flows such as occurs from floods and tides. TUFLOW, originally developed for just two-dimensional (2D) flows, stands for **T**wo-dimensional **U**nsteady **FLOW**. The fully 2D solution algorithm, based on Stelling 1984 and documented in Syme 1991, solves the full two-dimensional, depth averaged, momentum and continuity equations for free-surface flow. The initial development was carried out as a joint research and development project between WBM Oceanics Australia and The University of Queensland in 1990. The project successfully developed a 2D/1D dynamically linked modelling system (Syme 1991). Latter improvements from 1998 to today focus on hydraulic structures, flood modelling, advanced 2D/1D linking and using GIS for data management (Syme 2001a, Syme 2001b). TUFLOW has also been the subject of extensive testing and validation by WBM Pty Ltd and others (Barton 2001, Huxley, 2004).

TUFLOW is specifically orientated towards establishing flow patterns in coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, floodplains and urban areas where the flow patterns are essentially 2D in nature and cannot or would be awkward to represent using a 1D network model.

A powerful feature of TUFLOW is its ability to dynamically link to the 1D network of the xpswmm engine. In the xp environment, the user sets up a model as a combination of 1D network domains linked to 2D domains, i.e. the 2D and 1D domains are linked to form one model.

>
> **1.7.1 The Generic Graphical User Interface**
>
> The generic graphical user interface utilizes the current Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointing device technology as the state-of-the-art intuitive user environment.
>
> The user interface can also be described as object-oriented. A user first selects an object or range of objects using the pointing device, and then performs an operation on the selection by giving a menu command. For example, to delete a group of objects they are first selected with the mouse and the "Delete Objects" command is selected from the Edit Menu. The user interface is an interface to a database (.XP) storing all data required for the particular model it has been adapted. Through the user interface the database is linked to various tools for result presentation, data exchange and manipulation.
>
> The XP interface may be used to create a new infrastructure network as well as to edit an existing one. The XP user interface is object-oriented, which means the user selects the object, and then selects the operation to perform on it.
>
> The XP environment consists of:

- A window with a series of menus along the top of the screen used for controlling operation of the program.

- Several tool strips of icons for file operation, object creation/manipulation and short cuts to menu commands.

> The elements of the interface, namely, The Window, The Icons (The Toolbar), The Dialog Box, The Layer Control Panel, and The Pointing Device, and the method of manipulation of objects are described in the text below.
>
> **1.7.2 The Window**
>
> The Window provides the frame of reference for user interaction. The large display area provides a current view of the created network of links and nodes and any associated background drawings and text objects. A Network Overview dialog provides a means of changing the position of the current view of the network. The title of the current database (model) is displayed in the window title bar and status messages describing current program activity such as a description of the function and mouse position are displayed across the bottom of the window. This Status Bar on the bottom of the Window can be turned on/off using the Status Bar from the View Menu.

>
> The Dialog Box is a graphical view of the attribute database. In other words the Dialog Box is to attribute data what the Window is to the network spatial data. The Dialog Box contains different types of items or controls that represent different types of data or modeling choices. The common items in the dialog box are described below:
>
> Static Text Caption for Editable Text.

11

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> Editable Text Text strings or numbers. The insertion point for the text is contained in a rectangular field. Double-clicking in the field will select all text, and subsequent data entry will replace all existing text
>
> Check box A square check box is a flag for a particular option. You may select none, any or all options. A check box with underlying data is located on an action button. Check boxes are always optional.
>
> Choice Button The circular choice buttons (Radio Buttons) indicate a choice of one item from a group of options. Only one option may be selected from the group. A choice button located on an action button indicates underlying data. The selection of one of the choice buttons is mandatory.
>
> Action Button A rectangular action button controls dialog traversal (and therefore data structure). The OK and Cancel Action buttons are usually mapped to the "Enter" and “Esc” keys. The upper right hand corner X button on the dialog is also mapped to ESC and abandons all edits made in the dialog if pressed. A button item in a Job Control Dialog contains mandatory data. Other Action buttons include “Run” for the Utilities and “Import” for the Import dialog.
>
> Picture A picture data item is an icon or a symbol used to promote rapid comprehension. It is not a dynamic item and is only representative of typical modeling scenarios.
>
> <img src="./media/image9.png" style="width:5.2in;height:3.97986in" />
>
> One of the program’s unique features is that picture items are used extensively to symbolise physical attributes associated with the data. This allows presentation of the model to non-technical reviewers. When reviewing a model it is good practice to close dialogs with Cancel to protect making and saving changes to the model.
>
> Items are selected by using the mouse to position the pointer at an item then clicking or double clicking with the mouse button. You may also optionally move through the editable text box items by using the \<Tab\> and \<Shift-Tab\> keys.
>
> Pressing the Enter key is the same as clicking the OK button.
>
> Pressing the \<Esc\> key is the same as clicking the Cancel button or selecting the red upper right hand X.
>
> Holding down the \<Shift\> key while clicking an action button that would normally cascade to another dialog will only activate the Check Box or Choice Button and not cascade to underlying dialogs.
>
> See Also Dialog Icons

**1.7.6 The Menus**

The pull-down menu titles appear on a menu bar displayed underneath the window title. Each menu title represents a group of related commands. If certain commands do not make sense in the current context of what the user is doing, they are disabled and indicated by less prominent and shaded light gray.

> <img src="./media/image11.jpg" style="width:5.84306in;height:0.29028in" />

The most frequently used commands also have keyboard equivalents, indicated by a keyboard combination such as Ctrl+N (New) listed in the menu. Commands that require more information, typically entered via a Dialog Box, are indicated with three trailing dots after the menu item name.

The use of the menus is described in THE MENU BAR

**1.7.7 Tools**

A palette of object symbols (Icons) is provided for the creation and manipulation of objects comprising the network, performing calculations and managing project files. These icons are called tools and are grouped as toolbars. Some of these toolbars may be turned on and off by selecting Toolbar from the View Menu.

In xp’s default layout there is one toolstrip under the menu titles and two groups on the right side of the drawing window. Each of the toolbars can also be moved from the toolstrip to form a palette and be docked to the outer sides of the window. As a palette, clicking on the “X” in the upper right hand corner can turn off the toolbar.

SECTION 2: CREATING A MODEL

**2.1.2 Graphical Elements**

The model network is created using a set of graphical objects primarily consisting of polygons for catchments and links and nodes for the hydraulic network. In a 2D model you may also find polylines and polygons to describe the terrain and the boundaries and domain of the 2D model. The network of nodes is connected together by links with some additional elements provided for annotation and background reference. The XP environment supports the following types of objects.

> ***Symbol Type Description***

Node Used to represent physical objects such as manholes, inlets, ponds, outfalls or junctions of various links such as natural channels or closed conduits.

Link Single connection between nodes of closed or open conduit geometry. They represent physical elements, e.g. pipes, channels, overland flow paths, etc. A polylink is special type of link that has vertices between the end nodes. Pumps orifices, weirs and special links must be created with multi-link below.

Multi-link Multiple connections of conduits between nodes. Diversions such as pumps, orifices, weirs etc. are also created in multi-links.

Text Lines of text annotation used for labeling the backgrounds.

Polyline Polylines are used to represent 1D/2D connections, 2D boundaries and ridges and, gullies.

Polygon Polygons are used to represent catchments, landuse zones, and the 2D domains of flooded areas.

Cross A cross section is a temporary polyline that is draped on the DTM to create

section the geometry for a natural channel.

Each element of the network has certain editable spatial and display properties and a unique name. Display properties include the colour and line thickness of the object. Colours may be edited using the Windows colour panel. Spatial attributes include the position and dimensions of the object. Digital images and text notes can also be attached to nodes through the properties dialog.

**2.1.3 Creating a Network**

The network is created on the screen using the palette of tools (icons) contained in the tool strip in the window. To create a network, select the node tool from the toolstrip by clicking it. The cursor shape now changes to a node object symbol indicating a node is being created. Clicking in the window now defines the position of the node and creates it and gives it a unique name. The display properties of the new node (color and thickness) can be changed by choosing the pointer tool then right-click to get the pop-up menu. The pop-up menu allows you to open the Properties dialog.

Next, create the links between nodes, selecting the link tool and then clicking on the nodes you wish to connect. The cursor shape again changes to link object symbol indicating a link is being created. A link is directed from the first to the second node clicked upon indicating the direction of flow from upstream to downstream. An arrow is placed on the downstream end of the link indicating the direction of positive flow. The position of the second end of the link (the end towards which flows are directed) is indicated by a dotted outline that tracks the mouse movement.

A default unique name is automatically created for any object requiring a name. The prefix of the name for nodes and links can be set in the File  Properties menu command. For example you may wish to preface all nodes with “mh” or a basin name and links with “pipe”. Then as each node and link is created the names will be numbered sequentially using the prefix such as mh1, mh2 ... and pipe1, pipe2... The direction of the link can be modified from the link pop-up menu by choosing reverse direction.

As you draw a link, you may create a polylink (bent link) by holding down the \<Ctrl\> key as you click with the mouse. This will create a vertex at each point at which you click. Terminate the link by clicking without holding down the \<Ctrl\> key.

You may change an existing link to a polylink by first selecting the link, then right clicking and selecting Edit Vertices from the pop-up menu. Move the cursor to the location of the vertex. Click on the vertex to move the bend in the link.

You may remove a vertex by first selecting the link, then right clicking and selecting Edit Vertices from the pop-up menu. Move the cursor to the vertex, right click and select Delete Vertex.

In this manner it is not necessary to first create nodes and then join them with links, but rather perform both operations simultaneously.
>
> To create a branch select the Esc key on the keyboard then continue to create links from free space to the existing nodes or from an existing node to free space where the end node will be created.
>
> **2.1.4 Naming an Element**
>
> Every object in the network must have a unique name. No node may have a name already used by another node or link in the database. The names are generally limited to 10 alphanumeric characters. Three methods are available to name a network object, the last two of which invoke the Properties dialog box.

1.  Highlight the node or link then double-click on the name and modify the name directly on the screen. Follow the editing with an enter keystroke to terminate editing.

2.  Select the node then click the right mouse button. This will bring up a pop-up menu. Select Properties to enter the object name in the dialog.

3.  Highlight the node or link then select Properties from the Edit menu.

> If method (2) or (3) above is chosen, a dialog box similar to that shown below is then displayed. If the object selected is a link the coordinate boxes are not shown.

SECTION 2: CREATING A MODEL

Water Level Lines are polylines used to display 1D open channel and 2D results together. They extend from the left bank to the right bank of the channel. These polylines are used to create a TIN from the 1D node results which is

spatially displayed as a flood map. Water level lines may be manually added or generated automatically.

To **manually add** a single Water Level Line to given link perform the following:

1.  Select and right click on a Link. Hover over Water Level Lines and choose Add Water Level Line from the popup menu.

2.  An x will appear next to the cursor, Click once to add a vertex on the left bank.

3.  Continue adding vetexes by clicking.

4.  Double click on the right bank to complete the polyline.

Water Level Lines can be **automatically generated** by using the Generate Water Level Lines option.

For an example on how the flood map is generated from the Water Level Lines please review the following:

> <img src="./media/image50.png" style="width:5.99028in;height:3.04028in" />

**Consider the diagram above.**

**At a time step t**

WSEL at u/s node = WSEL1

WSEL at the d/s node = WSEL2

WSEL at WLL1:

Y1= (WSEL1+WSEL2)/L\*X1

WESEL at WLL2:

Y2= (WSEL1+WSEL2)/L\*X2

For all the vertices along WLL1, the WSEL = Y1

For all the vertices along WLL2, the WSEL = Y2

Finally the TIN will be created.

Node and link labels can be shown or hidden by selecting the viewable property in the layer control panel for node and link labels. Also, the network view can be adjusted by changing settings on the layer control panel. Very large networks will redraw quickly and look much cleaner without the clutter of object labels.
>
> **2.2.2 The Coordinate System**
>
> The screen network is essentially open-ended and unbounded in any direction. The coordinate system has its origin (0,0) at the lower left corner of the opening window and increases to the right and up. In the present implementation, the coordinates are stored in double precision format with up to 20 significant figures to enable the retention of real world coordinates. The coordinates are used in specifying the location of a node, text item, or the bounding rectangle of a background picture.

>
> **2.3.1 Creating a Background**
>
> Background pictures are special objects that can be created to act as passive backdrop on which the rest of the network may be overlaid.
>
> Pictures are stored as files on disk and only a reference to the file and the path is stored in the .XP file. These “Picture” files must be present for the background to be drawn. There is neither a limit to the number of background pictures that may be loaded into the network nor to the size of an individual picture. Pictures can be selected, deleted, moved, hidden, etc
>
> Five background picture types are supported: These include AutoCAD .DWG, and .DXF files, ESRI ArcView Shape files, digital photos such as .BMP, .JPG, .TIFF. and HPGL **(**HPGL/1) files which must be translated to a .PIC (a native XP Software format) using the supplied converter CVTHPGL.EXE.
>
> See also: Importing Background Pictures and Editing Background Pictures.
>
> Note: ESRI shape files and MapInfo files may also be added to and xpswmm model as a GIS Layer.
>
> **2.3.2 HPGL File Format**
>
> Previous versions converted HPGL/1 files to a proprietary .PIC format. This feature is no longer supported as the interface now allows native .DWG and .DXF files to be used as backgrounds without requiring conversion.
>
> The HPGL/1 file is usually created by configuring your CAD program (or other drawing programs) to send the HPGL output to a file instead of directly to the plotter.
>
> The CVTHPGL utility will create a .PIC file that can be displayed by this version of the program.

>
> **Pen Color** Color that is mapped to a particular HP plotter pen number.
>
> **Plotter Limits** Plotter pen limits in the X and Y directions. These coordinates are in plotter units. The P1 and P2 units should be equal or greater than the plotter unit’s settings of your HP Plotter. To obtain a higher resolution picture it is recommended that the plot be sent to fit the page and the page size be large. If the P1 and P2 limits specified are less than the P1 and P2 settings on your plotter than the background picture will be clipped.
>
> **Load Plotter Defaults** This will load the plotter settings (pen mappings and limits) from a file that was earlier saved by the corresponding Save button.
>
> **Save Plotter Defaults** This will save the existing settings (pen mappings and limits) to a file. Hints
>
> When using a HPGL/1 file the prime objective in creating a background picture is to maximize the detail while minimizing the size of the HPGL plotter file and hence re-draw performance. Some practical tips:
>
> When generating a plot file from a CAD package, apply any plotting scale factors that minimize the plotted size of the drawing. Remember that HPGL plotters have a resolution of 0.025mm, so that very small plots can still provide reasonable resolution, however, the resolution is coarser with smaller size plots.
>
> Transform splines to lines if possible. Splines generate lots of plotted points. Transforming spline vertices to Line Polygon vertices dramatically decreases the number of generated vectors while retaining acceptable resolution. This transformation can usually be achieved by exporting the drawing in some text format, editing it, then importing again, eg. DXF format from AutoCAD®.
>
> Any number of individual files may be imported as background pictures and overlaid or tiled.
>
> The mapping between plotter pen numbers and picture colors can be altered from the default by editing the plotter default file (by default, PL_DEF) used by CVTHPGL. This will avoid making any modifications to the CAD package configuration.
>
> Minimize the amount of unnecessary text or other drawn objects in the background file. Since text takes more time to draw than most lines this will increase performance and drawing file size
>
> HPGL/1 format:
>
> The background may also be imported from an HPGL/1 plot file that may be created via most CAD packages, or via numerous design packages that provide output to Hewlett Packard plotters.
>
> To create a background, an HPGL/1 plot file must be generated (from a CAD package, for example). This HPGL/1 file is then converted to the picture format via the “CVTHPGL” utility supplied with XP. CVTHPGL is invoked from the Get Background Menu.
>
> The procedure involved in creating a picture from a CAD package is as follows:

1.  Create the drawing in the CAD package;

2.  Ensure your CAD package is configured with a Hewlett Packard plotter for output. This must be in HPGL/1 format such as used for HP7580, HP7586, Draftsmaster etc. Newer Inkjet plotters like the HP650C, 700 series etc can be configured to accept input in HPGL/2 format (the default) or HPGL/1 format. This converter cannot use the HPGL/2 format.

3.  Plot the desired rectangle of interest, noting the co-ordinates of the boundaries. If you wish to retain the scale of your drawing package then the XP destination coordinates must correspond to the top-left and bottom-right corner (extreme points) of the drawing in your drawing package. It is also recommended to import your background picture before creating a database.

49

> xpswmm Reference Manual

0.  Select Get Background from the Special Menu and choose the HPGL format. When you select OK the “CVTHPGL” program will convert the HPGL/1 file into the internal XP picture format (PIC).

> Notes:
>
> An error log is created which lists any HPGL commands the program has been unable to translate.

The plotter defaults file "PL_DEF" defines the mapping of pen numbers to colors in a table at the head of the file.

> The first line of the file contains the number of pens, the following lines contain the mapping of pen number to color name. Pen number zero, the null pen, is also required to be mapped to a color.
>
> This pen color transformation allows customization for particular CAD packages. See the default file “PL_DEF” included with this program, for details.
>
> Once the HPGL file has been converted to a picture file, it is incorporated into the network as an XP Metafile. The user is prompted for the picture file name and destination-bounding rectangle via Dialog Box shown above.
>
> By default, the bounding rectangle fills the display window at the currently selected scale. To maintain the original proportion of the drawing, the user must recall the co-ordinates of the frame originally plotted and use these for the destination-bounding rectangle.
>
> **2.3.3 Importing Background Pictures**
>
> Background data in the form of aerial photos, ESRI GIS Shape files, contour maps or subdivision layouts may be imported to facilitate the creation of the network.
>
> Notes:

1.  If a CAD file (.dxf or .dwg) is imported as a background image it will be moved to the CAD layer. When xpswmm encounters a file created on earlier version with a CAD file in a background layer, the file will be moved to the CAD layer.

2.  Shape files may also be imported as GIS layers.

3.  .dxf and .dwg files should be added as CAD Layers.

> **2.4.3 Breaklines  
> Gully and Ridge**
>
> Gullies and ridges are breaklines that cause discontinuities in the surface of 2D active areas. They are represented as polylines. Effectively the elevations of the cells lying below the polyline are raised or lowered to correspond to the polyline. Within the modeling environment the minimum thickness of breakline is 1 cell.
>
> 2D Breaklines are defined as a gully (or ridge) polyline with a fixed elevation throughout. 3D breaklines are specified as a gully (or ridge) polyline with a specified elevation at each vertex.
>
> When the elevation (z value) derived from the DTM and the user defined elevation differs, xpswmm defines the breaklines using:
>
> Gully: minimum value
>
> Ridge maximum value
>
> For a gully, z values are modified only if the user defined z values are lower than the current DTM value. For a ridge, z values are modified only if the user defined z values are higher than the current DTM value. **To add a gully or ridge polyline using the graphical interface**:
>
> 1\. Highlight the layer name in the Layer Control Panel and check the visible, movable and selectable boxes.

To import only selected data, check the box next to Import Selected Data, select a property (or attribute) from the drop menu, and specify the value for selected records. The ‘Weld Vertices’ option can be selected in this dialog. When this option is turned on, each vertex added during import is first checked against existing vertices, and welded if any vertex exists in the same location. When it is turned off, this welding does not occur – a new vertex is added for every point imported – but the imported process may be faster.

This forces a flow boundary to the 1D. In the 2D boundary the HX stands for Head from an eXternal model (in this case the external model is the 1D).
>
> The SX boundary (Source from an eXternal model) is a sink source boundary to the 2D cells, this becomes a 1D water level boundary.
>
> The HX or head interface polyline is recommended for use when interfacing between 2D cells and a 1D node, where the 2D cells are larger than the connecting 1D system. An HX line is typically recommended when interfacing between a 1D open channel and 2D overbank/overland flow areas.
>
> The SX or flow interface polyline is recommended for use when interfacing between 2D cells and a 1D node, where the 2D cells are smaller than the connecting 1D system. An SX line is recommended when interfacing between a dense 2D grid and large culvers, for example.
>
> Further information on the both HX and SX interface lines can be found in the TUFLOW manual.
>
> **2.5.6 1D/2D Connections**
>
> 1D/2D Connections are polylines representing hydraulic links between 1D/2D Interface polyline vertices and 1D nodes. At each time step, the HGL in the 2D boundary and the 1D node are evaluated.
>
> Notes: 1D/2D Interface polyline(s) should be defined before 1D/2D Connections are created. The 1D/2D Interface polyline must be visible for the Snap Mode to function properly.
>
> The Ponding selection of Link Spillcrest to 2D or Link Invert to 2D must also be selected in 1D/2D simulations for all nodes with 1D/2D Connection lines. If there is a node with 1D/2D Connections snapped an no selection of Link to 2D, an error will be generated and the simulation cannot proceed. Simply connecting the node with the 1D/2D Connection polyline is not enough.
>
> You can manually add 1D/2D Connections lines or import these shapes as shown in the 2D Object Creation section.
>
> Please note: Importing 1D/2D Connection polylines is NOT the recommended way to apply these items to a model, rather manually connecting nodes to appropriate 1D/2D Interface polyline vertices is the appropriate method. The reason for this is that the imported 1D/2D connection lines will may be snapped to the appropriate connection points as they are when manually applied, these snapped or fused points are a requirement for the connections to be properly connected.
>
> **2.5.8 2D Head Boundary**
>
> The 2D head boundary is a polyline representing a time dependant head at an edge of a 2D Active Area. Vertices of a 2D head boundary must be coincident with vertices of a active 2D area – i.e. the 2D Head Boundary must be placed within the extents of an active 2D grid are.
>
> Free Outfall in 2D:

81

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> A 2D head boundary which is set at or below the draped 2D cell levels will force a free outfall to occur for all flows which enter the connecting cells for all flow rates. This procedure works as the cells adjacent to the head boundary covered cells will see dry adjacent cells and free flow into these dry adjacent cells will be allowed. The 2D head boundary covered cells will always be dry because the head level at these cells is forced to be below the cell level, essentially letting any flow volume which enters the given cells to fall through the cell and out of the 2D model space. This can be thought of as pushing the flow under the cells, which removes the flow from the model at a free outfall rate.

> **2.6 GIS Layers**

**GIS Layers**

GIS files may be added to an xpswmm model as separate layers. Files types include ESRI shape files and MapInfo mif files. The display properties of each layer may be adjusted and the attributes of any selected object may be viewed. Nodes and links and most polylines and polygons may be snapped to vertices of GIS arcs and polygons loaded through the GIS Layers. To snap to these items in the background ensure that the Snap has been turned on from the Job, Layer & Mode Control tools.

> <img src="./media/image93.jpg" style="width:5.95in;height:5.03333in" />

> ***SECTION 3: THE DATABASE  
> *3.1 Database Concepts**
>
> xpswmm maintains an internal database that integrates the spatial data associated with an object with the attribute data required by the model engine.
>
> The graphical network creation and manipulation can be considered as a specialized function dealing with the purely graphical attributes of objects, such as; display symbols, spatial coordinates, and connectivity.
>
> The method of creating the model-specific attribute data is through the Dialog Box or by some of the many available import methods.
>
> **THE DIALOG BOX**
>
> **THE PERMANENT DATABASE  
> THE WORKING DATABASE  
> DATABASE INTEGRITY**
>
> **3.2 The Permanent Database**
>
> The data managed by XP is permanently stored on disk in a "database" file, as an ordinary operating system file. This file should normally have an “.XP” extension. Data is only committed to this file during a Save command.
>
> The database stores both the graphical and non-graphical attributes of all objects in the network, and also the non­specific or general control data associated with a network, such as job title and time steps for the solution procedure, mode of analysis, links to external interface files etc.
>
> When using the Scenario Manager all of the model differences that create scenarios are stored in a Microsoft Access .MDB file. When sharing the model between users it will be necessary to give both the .XP and .MDB files.
>
> **3.3 The Working Database**
>
> To increase the size of networks able to be efficiently created and manipulated by XP, the program utilises a combination of memory and disk space to manage data.
>
> In editing sessions, the Permanent Database stored on the disk is not interacted with directly. All changes made are done to an internal working copy of the Permanent Database, known as the Working Database which is stored in memory.
>
> The Working Database is established when the Permanent Database is opened. The Permanent Database is updated only when the Working Database is "saved". Copies of the Working Database can be saved under different names at any time, the default name being the name of the Permanent Database when originally "opened".
>
> The Working Database is the active database to which all data editing changes are made. There can only be one active database at any time.
>
> Using the working database provides an error recovery procedure. Since almost all changes to the database are immediately recorded in the working database, catastrophic failures can be recovered from with a minimum of agony. Additionally, if you would like to revert to the permanent database and disregard changes made since the last save, choose Revert from the File pull-down menu.
>
> Additional information on file types may be found in File Extensions.
>
> **3.4 Database Integrity - test**
>
> As far as possible, data committed to the Working Database via the Dialog Box interface is checked and filtered to maintain the integrity and consistency of the database.
>
> In general, text strings entered by users are the most dangerous type of dialog item because they are a human-readable encoding of some fundamental data type such as a number. This encoding and decoding to and from text strings done by users and computers is a rich source of errors. XP checks all strings at three levels to ensure they can be interpreted correctly.

91

> xpswmm Reference Manual

1.  Absolute Validity

2.  A numerical string, for example, cannot contain invalid non-numeric characters.

3.  Absolute Range Checking – Outside of range generates an error

4.  Once a numerical string can be interpreted properly, its value is checked for validity in the context of the model, eg. A negative pipe length would not be accepted.

5.  “Reasonable Range” Checking – Outside of range generates a warning

6.  If a data item is within the absolute range it is also compared to a reasonable range defined by the Expert Engineer. If the data is between the absolute and reasonable range, a warning is generated and the user is asked to confirm that the data entered is correct and is not a typographical error. The user can ignore the warning and proceed to enter more data. If the data is outside of the absolute range, an error is generated and the user is required to fix the offending input before committing the data with the OK button on the dialog and continuing to enter additional data.

> These checks are applied to individual data items and are classed as low-level consistency checks. High-level consistency checks are also made, which generally involve placing constraints on relationships between data items. Because these checks rely on the existence of independent data items, often there is insufficient data for XP to perform these high-level checks interactively. These integrity checks are therefore performed off-line at the point of generating the data file for the model to solve.

92

> ***SECTION 4: COPY AND PASTE  
> *4.1 Using the Copy Buffer**
>
> The XP system uses an internal buffer to move or copy information between objects, cells in lists and fields in dialogs. Data may be “copied”, in which case the original data remains unchanged, or it may be “cut”. In the case of cutting data, the data is copied into the copy buffer and after the data is subsequently pasted the data in the copied object is cleared and reset to its default value.
>
> “Copying” or “cutting” of object data is restricted to either one item of a dialog or to the entire data structure of a node or link. Data can only be pasted into similar objects i.e. node data cannot be pasted into any object except for the same type of node. This is transparent to the user so you may select a multitude of different types of objects before “pasting” and the data will only be pasted into objects of the same type and mode as the parent.
>
> Data within the buffer remains active until the program is ended or another copy command is executed, whereupon the buffer data is overwritten with a new copy or cut command. Data may be copied between databases by closing the current database, opening the new one and then Pasting from the Copy buffer.
>
> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> **Copy Multiple Objects**
>
> **Copy a Single Item**
>
> **Copy a Dialog List (DLIST) Item**
>
> **Copy Global Data**
>
> **4.2 Copy Data From a Single Object**
>
> To copy all of the data associated with a node or link to one or more other similar items in one operation, first select the node or link to be copied and then select “Copy” from the Edit menu. The copied data is all data for the current mode. A keyboard equivalents of \<Ctrl\>+C and also exists for this command. After selecting an object the “Copy” and “Paste” is also available from the popup menu using a right mouse click. If the copy operation is successful xpswmm will then reports how many records have been copied into the buffer. For example:
>
> <img src="./media/image99.jpg" style="width:2.36667in;height:1.43681in" />
>
> To cut the data including the object from the model and have the contents reside in the buffer for a paste operation simply choose the “Cut” command from the Edit menu or use the \<Ctrl\>+X. If an object of similar type is selected then pasting will copy the cut data into the new object. If no object is selected then pasting will recreate the object with all of the cut data.
>
> To paste the copied data select one or more objects (by holding down the \<Shift\> key and clicking on multiple objects or by dragging a dotted rectangle around the selected objects) and hit \<Ctrl\>+V or select “Paste” from the Edit menu. xpswmm will now report to the screen the number of objects data has been pasted into and the number of records pasted. For example:
>
> <img src="./media/image100.jpg" style="width:2.45972in;height:1.45in" />
>
> When a multi-link is copied and pasted to a single conduit link, xpswmm will ask which conduit is to be copied from. The user must specify the conduit number before the paste is completed. Selecting ‘Cancel’ will not copy the data to any multi-links in the selection set.
>
> **4.3 Copy Multiple Objects**
>
> To copy both the graphical attributes plus all the data associated with a node or link, first select one or more objects by either dragging a box around them, or individually selecting objects using the \<Ctrl\> key. Copy the objects by selecting "Copy" from the Edit menu or \<Ctrl\>+C. If the operation is successful XP will report the number of database record and objects copied. For Example:
>
> 94
>
> SECTION 4: COPY AND PASTE
>
> <img src="./media/image101.png" style="width:2.42639in;height:1.41667in" />
>
> Many types of objects can be copied, including nodes, links, and text elements. When a link is copied the end nodes are also copied (because a link cannot exist without end nodes) so that pasting into an empty selection will properly create the copied link. A single link copied can still be pasted into a multiple selection in the usual way.
>
> To create new objects deselect all objects by clicking in open space then select "Paste" from the Edit menu or \<Ctrl\>+V. New objects will be created slightly offset from the original location and will be highlighted. They will also have new names automatically created by adding “.1” to the name if that name is not already in use. It may be necessary to clean up the screen by selecting "Redraw" from the toolstrip or from the "View" Menu. The objects can be renamed if the new name is not suitable before solving.
>
> When objects are pasted into a different database than that copied from, global database references are maintained but the actual data for the global database records (the global database definitions) are not pasted. These Global Data bases can be merged from one .XP project to another or single global database records can be copied from a source database into the copy buffer and then pasted into a target project. The merge command is located in the File menu. It is also possible to export global database records from one file and import them into another.
>
> **4.4 Copy a Single Item**
>
> To copy an individual item, open up the Dialog Box for the source object, select the copy icon (white multi-page) in the upper right-hand corner of the dialog then select the field or button by clicking on it. All text items, radio buttons or checkboxes can be copied in this manner. Close the Dialog Box.
>
> To paste the copied data select one or more objects (by holding down the \<Ctrl\> key and clicking on multiple objects or by dragging a dotted rectangle around the selected objects) and select “Paste” from the Edit Menu or hit the \<Ctrl\>+V keys. All links and all nodes can be selected by using the All Links and All Nodes icons on the toolstrip or the View-\>Select Objects menu commands.
>
> When copying a field or string value, the value is checked as if it were to be saved to the database before copying. For Radio Button items, only the active item in the group of buttons can be copied. For both Radio Buttons and Checkboxes with underlying data, only the flag itself and not the whole underlying data structure will be copied. Only single data items can be copied, structures including all underlying data cannot be copied as single items. However, when copying all of the data for an object all the underlying data is copied to the copy buffer and can be pasted to another object.
>
> **4.5 Copy a Dialog List (DLIST) Item**
>
> To copy a single cell in a dialog list (DLIST) first move the text insertion point to the cell you wish to copy. Select the text or numerical string by double-clicking or depressing the mouse and dragging over the entire string. Right mouse click to get a Window’s pop-up dialog and select Copy from the list. Alternatively using \<Ctrl\>+C will copy the selected string. Next move to the text insertion point to the cell(s) where you wish to insert the data and paste the data from the buffer using the right mouse click pop-up dialog or \<Ctrl\>+V and repeat as many times as necessary. If the DLIST is blank it will be necessary to **Insert** a row so that the right mouse button can display the pop up menu including the copy, cut and paste commands. Copying many cells or one cell to many is permissible in the DLIST using the spreadsheet style grid.

SECTION 5: THE INI FILE

PROJECTS = OFF \# project management (handling group of xp files)

DATE_FORMAT = mm/dd/yy

APP_FLAGS = "" \# M = Malaysian version, E = Extran only

> **5.3 File Names, Extensions and Paths**

The default location for files is the folder containing the .xp files (project folder). Files created by xpswmm are located in this folder. Alternative locations for many files can be mapped in the dialogs where these files are selected. It is strongly recommended that the project folder be located on a local drive.

The maximum path length (number of characters in folder name + file name) is 246 characters. For 2D models the maximum path length is 128.

xpswmm uses the following file naming conventions. Additional files are produced in 2D analysis.

DB?? The working copy of the XP database. This file is located in the directory pointed to by the TMP or XPTMP environment variable. This file is normally deleted when you Quit the program.

XP?? A snapshot of the current state of the working database (DB file). It is created when XP runs another program, eg. to Solve. This file is normally deleted when the XP file is re-opened.

LOCK A file used. This file is deleted upon termination of the child process.

MSGBOX The message box used to transfer executions between modules. This file is deleted upon termination of the child process.

\***.**XP The main database. This file is updated whenever Save is selected.

\*•XPT An XP template file. Essentially an XP file but it is used as a seed for subsequent .XP models

\*•XPV XP variable list file.

\*•BAK A backup of the main database. This file is created when a .XP file is opened.

\*•MDB An Access database file. This file is created by xpswmm when a .xp file is opened. If the model contains scenarios, the scenario information is stored in this file.

\*•MUT A file to prevent multiple user access of an opened .XP file. This file is created on open.

\*•XPP The projects database. This file is updated whenever Save is selected.

\*•XPX A text file in the XP eXchange format for import and export.

\*•OUT The text output file generated when a database is solved.

\*•RIZ A specialized formatted output file.

\*•PBS A specialized formatted output file.

\*•CON A specialized formatted output file.

\*•XLS A specialized formatted output file for spreadsheet import.

\*•CSV A specialized formatted output file for spreadsheet import.

\*•CDM A specialized formatted output file.

\*•DES An intermediate file containing new pipe diameters when using the design undersized conduits option.

\*•EXP An ASCII file containing the tabular XPX format. Created using the MAKE_XPX Configuration parameter.

\*•EPD A plot definitions file.

\*•PIC Background pictures or a file generated by Export Graphics.

\*•DWG An AutoCAD® drawing file

\*•DXF An AutoCAD® drawing file.

\*•SCR An AutoCAD® Script file generated by the Export Graphics menu command.

\*•SHP An ESRI® ArcView® GIS file

\*•MID A MapInfo® GIS file.

\*•MIF A MapInfo® GIS file.

> *Description:* Network display can now occur in two ways: regeneration or restore. Regeneration is the mode used up to now, which causes every network object’s display to be regenerated when the network window is redrawn. Restore mode restores a saved bit-mapped image of the network window, which takes a constant amount of time and is much quicker than a regenerate, but requires more memory. Restore is used as much as possible when the network window needs to be updated. The Redraw menu command now forces a regeneration to occur. If insufficient memory is available, a message will appear the first time a database is opened or created, and the option will be disabled.

***Icon Function***

This tool is used to select objects, move objects, reconnect links, re-scale the window, change object attributes and to enter data. At the network level the Pointer tool is used specifically to manipulate the current selection, move the current selection around, reconnect links and for re-scaling. At the dialog level it is used to select a data item or to position the cursor for editing text.

The "current selection" is the set of objects which many menu commands operate upon. Objects that are members of a selection are indicated in inverse video (bright magenta). To make a single object the current selection, just point to it and click.

To select a group of objects in a single operation the mouse button is held down and the dotted outline of a box is dragged around the desired group. To deselect everything, the mouse is clicked in open space. All the objects in a path between two nodes can be selected by first clicking on one node, then, with the \<Ctrl\> key held down, clicking on the other end node.

> SECTION 6: THE TOOLBAR
>
> To extend a selection, the \<Shift\> key is held down in conjunction with the selection operation. The \<Shift\> key causes new selections to be toggled.
>
> **Text** This tool is used to annotate the network by placing text objects on the network. The selection of the text
>
> **Tool** tool causes the cursor to change to an arrow with word “TEXT” below it. The user moves to the location to enter the text, presses the mouse button, inserts the text, terminating it with the \<Enter\> or \<cr\> key. xpswmm remains in the text input mode until another object creation tool is selected.
>
> The text serves as a comment or notation for the network and may be moved or modified in the same manner as any other object. The attributes of the text such as color and font can be edited by double-clicking on the text string with the pointer tool.
>
> **Node** This tool is used to create nodes on the network. These may physically represent a manhole or pit, an inlet
>
> **Tool** for a catchment, a junction of links, a pond or retarding basin an outfall or a Best Management Practice (BMP). Selecting the node tool changes the cursor to the node shape and places you in a mode for creating node objects. Clicking anywhere inside the window will create a new node at that point with default display attributes.
>
> In some cases the node shape may change to represent different physical structures. Triangular nodes have storage properties other than the system defaults.
>
> **Link** This tool is used to create an open or closed conduit between two nodes. Links cannot exist without
>
> **Tool** nodes at the end points, and have a sense of direction indicated by an arrow line. When the link tool is selected, the cursor changes to a link shape, and the user is in a mode for creating links between nodes. The first click in the window defines the node from which the link emanates. The next and subsequent mouse clicks identify the node to which the link joins. A straight line is then drawn between these two nodes with an arrow indicating direction.
>
> If the mouse is not clicked on an existing node, then a default node is created at that point for the new link. Following each mouse click in the drawing area, a dotted line tracks the mouse's movements, indicating how the new link will appear. This is the most effective way of creating a new network.
>
> The drawn link between nodes does not need to be straight and can support vertices if it is drawn as a polylinkPolylink.
>
> **Multi-** This tool is used to create a link that joins two nodes in a network by more than one conduit such as a dual
>
> **Link** drainage model with a street and a closed conduit between each node. This type of link includes the
>
> **tool** choice of up to 7 open and closed conduits applicable to the link tool but in addition includes diversion structures such as pumps, weirs, orifices, regulators and other real time control elements. To create a multi-link, select the multi-link tool and the cursor changes to a pointer with broken link underneath.
>
> An existing link may be converted to a multi-link selecting it, right clicking and selecting Multi Link from the pop-up menu. Also an existing multi-link may be converted to a link (single conduit shape) by selecting it, right clicking and selecting Single Link from the pop-up menu.
>
> A polylink is a special type of link that has vertices between the two end-nodes. It may be used to define the path of a river, or to indicate a curved pipe, or in any situation where the end-nodes are not connected in a straight path.
>
> The drawn multi-link between nodes does not need to be straight and can support vertices if it is drawn as a polylinkPolylink.
>
> **Polylin** Draws a polyline (line with multiple vertices). Polylines are used to represent 2D boundaries, 1D/2D
>
> **e tool** connections and breaklines. Before creating the polyline the user must select the type of polyline by selecting the appropriate layer in the layer control panel. The layer also needs to be visible, movable and selectable.
>
> **Polygo** Draws a polygon (enclosed area). Polygons are used to create catchments for the Runoff mode, and
>
> **n tool** specific types of areas within the 2D domain. Before creating the polygon the user must select the type of polygon by selecting the appropriate layer in the layer control panel. The layer also needs to be visible, movable and selectable.
>
> **Ruler** Used to measure distance between two points, the length of a polyline or the perimeter and area of a

**tool** polygon. In version 2013 and later, the ruler tool displays the total slope of a multi-segmented line and the slope of the last segment. This can be used to determine and enter the slope for catchments and other fields. Select the Ruler tool and draw line segments on the network.

SECTION 6: THE TOOLBAR

In the default setting, xpswmm opens with the Layer Control Panel docked to the left side of the viewing area. This panel is used to mange settings for layers in both 1D and 2D models. The layers are organized in expandable/collapsible groups in a Windows Explorer style fashion. If your version does not have all of the modules, some of the layers will be disabled.

**Viewing the Layer Control Panel**

Clicking on the Layer tool on the Job, Layer and Mode Control tool strip toggles the (show/hide) attribute of the Layer Control Panel.

When the Layer Control Panel is showing, clicking on the (x) on the right corner of the header will hide the panel. **Layer Control Panel Layout**

The Layer Control Panel has two layout modes: docked and undocked. The default layout is docked to the left border of the main xpswmm window.

The panel may be undocked by double clicking on the header or dragging it to a new location. It may be docked to the left or right border of the main window. When it is undocked, the panel may be resized by moving the mouse over an edge or corner. When the pointer changes to a double headed arrow, depress the left button and drag the edge or side. When the panel is docked, its width may be adjusted by selecting the right edge, holding the left button down and dragging to the desired position.

The layers are grouped. Group headers are indicated by a +/- check. The groups may be expanded/collapsed by clicking on the check box or double clicking on the layer name.

**Managing Layers**

Each layer name is preceded by two graphics. The check box toggles the display of the layer off/on. The second is either an icon for the layer or a locked symbol. When the icon is a filled square, it indicates the current display properties of the layer.

A layer is locked by highlighting the layer name, right clicking and selecting Lock Layer from the pop-up menu. When a layer is locked, it cannot be edited in the graphical interface. Data associated with objects in the layer may be edited. Other tasks are accessed by right clicking on the name of the layer. The menu varies according to the function of the layer.

The boxes preceding the names of the layers indicate their display color. The absence of a color box indicates that the layer’s display properties have not been selected.

**Layer Properties**

The display properties of any layer may be adjusted by moving the mouse over the name of the layer and right clicking. Note that this dialog is different for layers that are polylines, polygons or vectors.

> The menu bar displays the titles of ten menus. Many of the menus, File, Edit, Project, View, Analyze, Window and Help are common to all systems utilizing the XP interface. The Configuration, Tools and Results menu is specific to the application. Whenever you work with XP you enter commands by pointing to a menu, then dragging down to highlight the command you want. Any commands in the menu that are disabled are displayed as dimmed or bracketed. A disabled menu item indicates that the command is not available in the current context, and that some other action is required before it can be invoked.

> As a short cut, keyboard equivalents are available for the most frequently used commands. The keyboard equivalent is indicated by an underlining “\_” of the letter appropriate to this command. To invoke commands from a menu use the \<Alt\> key in conjunction with the character, for example \<Alt-F\> to invoke the File menu. Once the menu is displayed press the underlined character of the menu to select the command, for example N to open a New file or R acces Recent files.
>
> Some commonly used commands use the \<Ctrl\> key in conjunction with the appropriate menu command as an additional shortcut, for example \<Ctrl-O\> to open a new file. All of the Results menu items and some other commands use the Function keys as keyboard shortcuts, for example F5 to solve a model or F6 to Browse the output file.

**7.1.3 Merge**

Choose this option to append an existing XP database to the existing currently opened database. Nodes and Links, Global Databases and Job Control data can be imported from the merged XP file.

> <img src="./media/image131.jpg" style="width:3.14653in;height:1.77014in" />

After selecting this option you will be prompted for the name of the XP file whose data you wish to import. Any number of databases may be merged, subject to the node and link limitations of the application.

**7.1.4 Close**

Choose this option if you are finished with this database and want to open another existing file or create a new one. If no changes have been made to the current file, it will be closed immediately, otherwise a "Save Changes?" prompt will appear, allowing you the option of closing without saving changes, or cancelling the "Close" operation. Unless merging files the active database must be closed before opening another one.

When the database is closed the temporary work file is copied to the original database. Until close is selected you may revert to your original unchanged database by selecting the "Revert" command from this menu.

A file may also be closed by clicking on the (x) "close box" on the right end menu bar.

*Runoff*

> This flag controls the import of Runoff data. If this flag is off any Runoff data in the input file will be ignored. If this flag is selected you will be given the option of selecting specific Runoff data to be imported.
>
> *Transport*
>
> This flag controls the import of Transport (Sanitary) data. If this flag is off any Transport data in the input file will be ignored. If this flag is selected you will be given the option of selecting specific Transport data to be imported.

*Extran*

> This flag controls the import of Extran (Hydraulics) data. If this flag is off any Extran data in the input file will be ignored. If this flag is selected you will be given the option of selecting specific Extran data to be imported. At present ALL Extran data is imported.

>
> The JNS variable is used to identify the node name to import into. If this name is empty or zero, then a node may be generated with a name of N\_\<x\>, where \<x\> is a number which makes the name unique. If this name is not empty, then a match will be sought with this name, observing the usual rules for Object Control.

> *EPA-SWMM 4.2 Data File*
>
> Select this option to import an EPA-SWMM version 4.0 - 4.2 data file. Using this option, data for specific modules and specific data within each module may be imported. Part of a network may also be imported by only importing into existing or highlighted objects. The SWMM blocks that are supported are Runoff, TRANSPORT, EXTRAN, STORAGE/TREATMENT. Import automatically detects which block is within the data file. <u>If multiple modes are imported EXTRAN should be imported first, on its own, and the other nodes added by re-importing the data file a second time</u>.

> **Import into all Objects**
>
> This option allows any existing object to be imported into, regardless of whether or not the object has been highlighted.
>
> **Import into Selected Objects**
>
> This option is quite powerful and restrictive in that it only allows network objects that are currently highlighted to have data imported into them. New objects cannot be created from the data file. This option is particularly useful when incrementally creating a network and importing a data file several times. The new objects can be highlighted and import restricted to only these objects.

> The XPX file consists of a series of commands with various parameters assigned to them to operate on. There are ten types of XPX commands. They are:

1.  **The node command**

2.  The link command

3.  The data command

4.  The table command

5.  The global database command

6.  **The global database item command**

7.  **The global database data command**

8.  **The makemulti command**

9.  **The link vertex command**

10. **The cross section vertex command**

11. **The Catchment command**

> CONTEXT-SENSITIVE RULES:
>
> Any references to objects must already be defined i.e. NODE commands must appear before LINK commands which reference them, and similarly DATA commands must appear after the object references are defined.
>
> An un-named global object is defined by an empty string (“”).
>
> Notes: 1. Object names are not case-sensitive.

2.  Strings with embedded white space can be enclosed in double-quotes (“).

3.  Data can be commented out using 'C' style comments i.e. /\* This is a comment \*/

> *XPX Node Command*
>
> **COMMAND:** NODE
>
> **DESCRIPTION:** The node command defining a particular node must appear in the XPX file before any reference can be made to data or links associated with it. There is no rigid structure to the order that these command appear in provided the above rule is complied with. The node_command consists of the word NODE followed by a node_type, a node_name and an X and Y value which represent it coordinates.
>
> **SYNTAX:** NODE node_type node_name x y
>
> **VARIABLES:**
>
> *Node_type (Integer)* The node_type is an integer value which specifies the shape and colour the node will appear in its screen representation when the XPX file is imported. The various values and shapes for node_type are listed below. In the current implementation of xpswmm all resulting nodes will be circular and take on the default property specified in the File-\>Properties... dialog. A node will automatically become triangular in shape when storage data is active.
>
> *Node Type Shape*

>
> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> *Node_from (String)* The node_from parameter must be enclosed in double quotation marks. It is an alphanumeric string representing the name of the upstream connecting node for the link specified in link_name.
>
> *Node_to (String)* The node_to parameter must be enclosed in double quotation marks. It is an alphanumeric string representing the name of the downstream connecting node for the link specified in link_name.
>
> The node_from and node_to nodes must have been specified earlier in the XPX file using the NODE comand above. A link must be specified before any dat may be defined which is associated with the link.
>
> *command node_type link_name node_from node_to*
>
> **EXAMPLE:** LINK 136 “Link 1” “mh a1” “mh b1”
>
> *XPX Data Command*
>
> **COMMAND:** DATA
>
> **DESCRIPTION:** The data_command is used to assign data attributes to objects (links and nodes) which have been defined earlier in the XPX file. It must begin with the word DATA and be followed by a field_name, and object_name to attach the data to, an instance , a count and data_string, the actual data being defined.
>
> **SYNTAX:** DATA field_name object_name instance count {data_string}
>
> **VARIABLES:**
>
> *Field_name (String)* The data field_name is any name that is pertinent to this type of object, either a link or node. The name is not case-sensitive
>
> The appropriate field name may be found in this reference or by using the “Get Field Info” facility in XP (using the **Dialog Icon** )
>
> *Object \_name (String)* The object_name is any quoted string which has been previously defined as a link or node using the LINK or NODE command. The data_string will be assigned to this object_name and placed in the database field called field_name. If the field_name is a global value and not associated with an object then the object_name is defined as a pair of double quotes (i.e. “”)
>
> *Instance (Integer)* The instance is an integer value which allows for multiple instances of the same data type for the one object. For example, multiple conduits in one link. The first instance of a data type is assigned a value of 0 (zero). the second instance is 1 (one) and so on. For a data type which has only one instance the value will be 0 (zero).
>
> *Count (Integer)* This value specifies how many data items to expect in the following data_string. Normally this is 1 (one) except for list data. For example, user inflow hydrographs have more than 1 (one) data point. If there were 25 points in the hydrograph you would specify a count of 25 and then follow with a data string containing 25 values.
>
> 154
>
> SECTION 7: MENUS
>
> Data_string (String) This is a string of value(s) which will be placed in the database field specified by the field_name string attached to the object specified by the object_name string. There must be as many data items in the data string as is specified by the value of the count variable and they must be separated by at least 1 (one) space.

Variables from each database need to be mapped prior to importing the raw data from the source database. Listed in this dialog are the full set of source database variables which can be used to match those in the xp database.

You need to select variables for the selected object type. Data from each object type should be mapped separately.

Select the variable that you wish to import and then hit the Set button to choose a variable for the software database. This procedure should be repeated for all elements in the source database that you wish to import.

There are Mandatory Data requirements for each object type:

> This comprehensive HEC-RAS model importer provides users the ability to import the cross sections, reach layout, vertical reach data and downstream boundary conditions automatically from a HEC-RAS geometry file (\*.g0\*) by selecing the All Network option. The Cross Section only option allows the importing of only the cross sections from the given HEC-RAS geometry file.
>
> A description of the various dialog options is listed below:
>
> **File Name**: Select the HecRas geometry file that you want to import. All files \*.g0\* will be shown for selection.
>
> **All Network/Crosssection only**: The ‘All Network’ option will import the whole model by creating xp nodes and links, assigning the cross sections to the link and determining elevations for the nodes. The’ Cross Section’ option will only populate the Natural Section Shapes records within the Global Database.
>
> Note that the HecRas description names for the cross sections are used for the natural section global database entries in xp-swmm. Wherever a description is too long it is trimmed and a suffix \#(enumeration) is added.
>
> **Node Merging Distance**: This value is only used if a geometry file is imported using the ‘All Network’ option onto a non-empty xp-swmm network. Before a new node is created it is checked whether there is already an existing node in the network whose distance to the node to be created would be less than the node merging distance. If such a node is found, no new node is created and the existing node is used for connection of the links in the exported model.
>
> **Description/Shape**: This table gives an overview on all Cross Sections that are to be imported before the final import is acknowledged by pushing the ‘Ok’ button. The user can elect to untick cross section in which case those cross sections then will not be written to the global database or used for the link cross section assignment when the ‘All Network’ option is used.

> **Procedure for creating objects based on HEC-RAS geometry**

174

> SECTION 7: MENUS
>
> The concept of nodes does not exist in HEC-RAS. However, in xp nodes are essential for modeling. Each time a HecRas river segment is read, the importing routine will first create an xp node at the start and end point of the river polyline that describes the segment. Since split/join nodes in a HecRas model are always start and/or endpoints of a river segment, this implies that an xp node will be created at each split/join location, refer to picture in the *Node Elevations Assignment* section below.
>
> After the river polyline is known subsequently all cross sections are read and if they are geo-referenced by a GIS line, xp nodes are created at each intersection point of a GIS Cross Section line with the river polyline. If the cross sections are not geo-referenced xp will draw the river as a straight-line segment and use the segment lengths connotated with the cross sections to mark the distances between nodes. Note that for the node creation also Cross Sections are considered that have been unticked by the user.
>
> Links are created for every pair of subsequent nodes and if the data is geo-referenced the river bends will be assigned to the appropriate links
>
> <img src="./media/image164.png" style="width:5.90694in;height:2.60625in" />
>
> Note that at the moment only cross sections for HecRas types 1 (river reach) and 3 (bridge) are read from the geometry file.
>
> <img src="./media/image165.png" style="width:3.27292in;height:2.02361in" />
>
> **Parameter Assignment for XP Links**
>
> The following parameters are assigned to an XP link during the importing process:

- Cross section line (if any can be found at the links U/S or D/S node)

- The natural section shape (which is the one linked to the cross section line above)

- Left and right overbank values

- Roughness values for left overbank, center channel and right overbank

> 175
>
> xpswmm Reference Manual

- Channel length for left overbank, center channel and right overbank

- U/S and D/S invert elevation which are the nodes U/S and D/S invert elevations, see following section for additional details

> With exemption of the invert elevation all of the above data stem from the HecRas cross section that gets assigned to the XP link.
>
> For each XP link it is checked whether a Cross Section line triggered the creation of the U/S and/or D/S node. If this is the case we say that there is a cross section *available* at the U/S and/or D/S end of the link. Since in HEC-RAS the cross section is meant for the river segment directly downstream, an U/S available Cross Sections has precedence, i.e. each time there is a Cross Section available at the U/S end of the link, this Cross Section is assigned to the link.
>
> Only if there is no Cross Section available at the U/S end, it is checked whether there is a Cross Section available at the D/S end and –if so- this Cross Section will be assigned to the link. This can for example happen for the links directly downstream of a junction/split node or whenever the user has unticked Cross Sections for assignment. If no Cross Section is found that can be assigned to the link, the natural section shape of that link will remain unassigned and a warning message is written to the error log.
>
> We have to mention HEC-RAS bridge links here as they build an exception to the rule. First we state that at the moment only the natural channel data outlined above will be imported for bridge links, the bridge specific parameters will follow in a second step. If there is Cross Section data found in the section of the geometry file that defines the Bridge link, the U/S Cross Section data of the bridge will be assigned as natural shape to the Bridge link. If there is no Cross Section defined in the bridge section, the previously found Cross Section, i.e. the Cross Section of the river segment directly upstream (‘Upstream of bridge embankment’) will be assigned to the bridge link. The same holds true for the parameters mentioned above: if they are defined with the bridge par in the geometry file, those values will be assigned to the bridge link otherwise the values are taken from the link directly upstream.
>
> As we handle the case in which the data is taken from the link directly upstream as a case of copying data, bridges will never have a Cross Section assigned that is linked to a GIS Cross Section link.
>
> Note on the Cross Section defined for the river polyline endpoint in HEC-RAS. If the Cross Section is not assigned to the last XP link it is redundant in the XP simulation. It is planned to use this Cross Section for an outfall boundary condition.
>
> **Node Elevation Assignment**
>
> If the node was created as an intersection of the river polyline and a GIS cross section line, the node’s invert elevation will be the lowest point of the cross section profile that is linked to exactly that cross section line. This chain is broken if the cross section was unticked for import, in that case the node will not get an invert elevation assigned.
>
> A special case arises for XP nodes that were created at a HEC-RAS junction/split location.

SECTION 7: MENUS

> <img src="./media/image166.jpg" style="width:3.39653in;height:4.42986in" />
>
> In HEC-RAS there is no cross section defined for the junction/join as this not required for the HEC-RAS engine. Hence, we cannot derive an invert elevation for the junction/split node from a cross section.
>
> Instead, we are using an inverse distance weighted interpolation on all nodes adjacent to the junction/split node to derive the invert elevation.
>
> This is best illustrated by an example. In the above model we already determined:
>
> Invert Elevation Node4: 19.52, length Link5: 80  
> Invert Elevation Node16: 19.35, length Link16: 170  
> Invert Elevation Node6:: 19.32, length Link6: 130
>
> Now the distance weighted interpolation for the invert elevation of Node5 yields:
>
> 1/80 \* 19.52 + 1/170 \* 19.35 + 1/130 \* 19.32 / (1/80+1/170+1/130= 19.4226.
>
> Lastly we check whether the elevation computed is larger than the downstream invert elevations. For a split node it might happen that the computed elevation is indeed lower than one of the downstream elevations. But since we want to avoid creating a link with an adverse slope we would in this case set the invert elevation to the maximum of the downstream invert elevations.
>
> In the example 19.4226 is larger than 19.35 and 19.32 so it will be the value that we assign as the invert elevation to Node5.
>
> Each time such a weighted interpolation is performed an info message will be written to the log file. Note that nodes for which no invert elevation could be determined will have invert elevation 0.0.
>
> In a last step the ground elevation is determined for every node. This is simply the invert elevation plus the maximum depth of all incident channels.

**7.4.14 Toolbar**

The toolbar can be turned on or off by selecting this menu option. The toolbar can also be “torn off” the window and allowed to float or attached to one of the other window borders.

**7.4.15 Status Bar**

The status bar at the bottom of the main window can be set to visible or hidden selecting by this command. The check mark indicates that the stats bar is visible.

> <img src="./media/image195.jpg" style="width:6.00694in;height:0.13333in" />

The status bar has 7 boxes. From left to right, the information displayed is:

1.  Progress bar (only displayed during selected operations)

2.  X, Y & Z coordinates of cursor (Z displayed if a TIN layer is active)

3.  The active mode

4.  The current scale

5.  Status of the Caps Lock keyboard toggle

6.  Status of the Num Lock keyboard toggle

7.  Status of the Insert/Overlay keyboard toggle

Note that the status bar is completely displayed only when the window is utilizing the complete width of the monitor. Also, the status bar may be partially hidden when the Object Creation tools or the Network Viewing and Navigation

tools palettes are dock to the right margin of the main window.

**7.4.16 Split**

Display multiple views of the network using this option. This option is not implemented in this version of the software.

**7.1.17 Tidy Network**

If this option is selected the existing network will be rearranged to minimize conduits crossing over one another. This option is useful; as nodes created by import are placed in an approximate grid and the network can become quite messy when the links connecting the nodes are created. The tidy up procedure works best with purely dendritic networks. The network connectivity and data is not changed by this tool, only the location of nodes is changed to create straight branches and create a reasonable flow schematic.

SECTION 7: MENUS

> xpswmm can operate in different modes: Runoff, Sanitary and Hydraulics. The modes are controlled via the "Modes" command under the Configuration menu. The 3 modes are provided to segment the model into logical parts and thus reduce the complexity of the user interface.
>
> The 3 modes have the following functions:
>
> Runoff: Rainfall/Runoff/Water Quality generation, simple hydraulics.
>
> Sanitary: Sewer loading, sewer treatment, retarding basin/BMP design, kinematic wave hydraulics.
>
> Hydraulics: Dynamic flow routing, complex hydraulics.
>
> The xpswmm mode can be set 3 ways:

1)  selecting the Rnf, San or Hdr tool from the toolstrip in the main window

2)  selecting Mode Properties form the Configuratin Menu. In the SWMM Mode of Operation dialog select the Runoff, Sanitary or Hrdraulics radio button from the Current Mode Group.

3)  selecting Mode from the Configuration menu and then selecting Runoff, Sanitary or Hrdraulics.

> The ability to define different modes has several advantages. It allows sub-branches of the network to be defined in Runoff mode, for instance, and the main branch in EXTRAN Mode. Thus the complex hydraulic analysis is done on a smaller, more hydraulically sensitive network with significantly shorter run durations.
>
> ***Note:** When generating flows from a Runoff file containing a number of discrete un-connected nodes xpswmm will, by default, only solve for one network, ie. one set of connected nodes and links. To enable all nodes to be solved within the one network, connect the nodes together in any order and delete the links from the runoff mode. The network will then appear to be contiguous but will behave as a series of discrete, unconnected elements.*
>
> **7.5.6 Units**
>
> This Dialog allows you to select between Metric and U.S. Standard units for the model. When a NEW database is created, the units will be prompted for. If units are changed after a database is created, then data conversions are NOT done. It is important to set the units expected to be used at the time a database is created.

If this option is used then the time step iterations will stop when the sum of the flow through the node in successive iterations is less than the value of the head tolerance.

**7.6.12 Calibrate Model  
Automatic Calibration**

This module is an option that may be purchased from XP Software. Contact XP Software Sales to obtain pricing or an authorized copy of XP-SWMM with the automatic calibration tools. This module facilitates automated calibration by interfacing XP-SWMM with PEST , a non-linear parameter optimization engine. The sum of squared differences between modeled results and observed or target results is minimized in the weighted least squares sense. For example the difference between many points on a measured outfall hydrograph and a computed outfall hydrograph can be minimized to yield a high degree of fit.

These calibration parameters can be bound to reasonable engineering limits and the estimated parameter values can then be imported as the final calibrated model.

SECTION 7: MENUS

This button plots all of the observation data measured vs. Computed. Graphically a 45-degree line represents perfect correlation between measured and computed data.

**Update Model Values**

Loads the current “Model Value” computed from the last simulation run into the observation table. These results are compared to the observation value to determine the degree of fit.

**Insert/Delete/Append Row**

Inserts, deletes or appends a row in the observation table.

**Calibrate**

This button launches the calibration process by sending the generated control file to the PEST engine designated in the SWMXP.INI file. Calibration of the model must follow the generation and checking of all of the template files, instruction files, and PEST control file.

**Calibration Library (LIBRARY.CAL file)**

This file contains the current set of XPX variables that are enabled for automatic calibration. The columns within the file contains instructions for the software to locate object names and the location of the variable in the data file (.DAT). Not all XPX variables or xpswmm parameters are suitable calibration parameters.

The LIBRARY.CAL file below contains the most common and most suitable XP variables that can be used for calibration.

**XPX_Name**

The XPX variable name of the calibration parameter. R\_ usually precedes RUNOFF variables T\_ precedes most TRANSPORT variables. Consult the XPX references in the help or manual for more information on an individual variable.

**Layer**

The mode of xpswmm to which the variable applies. This column also identifies the section of the data file to find the variable. The software uses this field to index to the appropriate section of the data file.

**Row**

The data file (.DAT) card or row label that contains the calibration parameter. These labels correspond to xpswmm’s data file structure and is very similar to that of EPA SWMM.

**Column**

The *i*th column where i is the integer representing which column in the data file will contain the calibration parameter. For example, R_WIDTH (the subcatchment width) is located on the H1 card of the data file in the 5th column. In other words it is the fifth item on the H1 line. The software uses this column to index to the correct location to place the PEST ID.

**Name_Locator**

Similar to the Column data the Name_Locator instructs the software where to find the object name on the data line. In a few cases such as RUNOFF water quality data the object name appears on a previous line. A value of -1 is used in this case. A value of 0 is used when the variable is not related to any object such as Job Control parameters.

**Calibration Parameters**

274

xpswmm Reference Manual

Inserts or deletes a selected row from the observation table.

**Control File**

**Generate**

Generates a default PEST control file using the MAKES CTL function designated in the SWMXP.INI file. This file will include default values for the input parameters of PEST, the calibration parameters in the parameter file, and will reference the instruction file and template file you have created. It will then need to be edited to replace default values and commands with ones appropriate for your modeling.

**Edit**

Loads the current PEST control file into the current editor. The file must then be modified by replacing default values with appropriate PEST input parameters.

**Check**

Reads the PEST Control file, making sure that all necessary items of information are present on this file and that every item is consistent with every other item. It also checks that all parameters and observations cited in the PEST control file are also cited in the template file(s) and instruction file(s) referenced in the PEST control file, and that parameters and observations cited in the template file and instruction file are also listed in the PEST control file.

**Create Files**

Creates the template file which PEST uses to create an updated data file (.DAT) to send to the SWMM engine by substituting the PEST ID for the numerical value contained in the DAT file. In addition, a parameter file is created to generate the starting values for the first PEST execution of the model and these string values are used in the creation of the PEST control file. After the creation of these files a CALIBRAT.LOG file will be displayed in the current editor listing any errors in the creation of the template file. Such errors may include parameters that are not currently supported in the calibration procedure or objects that cannot be located in the data file.

Note: Two conditions must be met for the insertion of a calibration parameter into the template file. The first is that the object and SWMM input parameter referenced by the <u>XPX variable</u> must be found in the data file. In other words, no substitution of PEST ID’s will be performed if the object and corresponding variable are not found in the data file. The second condition requires that the XP variable be contained in the calibration library file . This file contains all of the default XP variables that can be used in the automatic calibration option of XP-SWMM.

**Instruction File**

**Generate**

Generates the first line of an instruction file and places all of the observation variables from the observation table on separate lines.

**Edit**

Loads the current instruction file with all of the observation variables into the editor designated in the SWMXP.INI file. The file must then have relevant search text appropriately entered to locate these variables in the output file(.OUT) and/or other text file(s).

**Check**

Checks the syntax and searching capabilities of the instruction file with the output file (.OUT). This is accomplished by sending the instruction file name and path along with the output file (.OUT) name and path to the CHK INSTRUCTION function designated in the SWMXP.INI file. A INSCHEK.LOG file is then created and displayed in your current editor displaying all warnings, errors and confirmation messages,

**Load XPX Variables**

This button imports an XPX file into the calibration parameter table. The use of an XPX file for the import of calibration parameters is a novel approach. The export of an XPX file is a very powerful function that allows the user to export a selection of variables and objects. For example the user may highlight a particular branch of the network and choose the % impervious of each subcatchment and the pipe roughness used in the EXTRAN layer. This XPX file can then

276

SECTION 7: MENUS

be imported and a PEST ID would be assigned for each of these parameters. A large amount of parameters can be selected and easily imported in this fashion to generate the template that PEST will use. In essence, the XPX file contains all of the parameters you are freeing up so that PEST may adjust them in the calibration process.

**Parameters**

This button opens the Calibration Parameters dialog for imputing all of the calibration parameters to be adjusted by PEST in the calibration process. In addition, the generation of the template and parameter file is handled by this function.;

**Parameter File  
Edit**

Loads the current parameter file into the editor. Initial values of each calibration parameter could be modified in the editor or changed in the calibration parameter table.

**Precision  
Single/Double**

Selecting the radio button on Single or Double instructs PEST to write parameters to model input files using single precision or double precision protocol. For single precision the parameter values will never be greater than 13 characters in length (even if the parameter space allows for a greater length) and the exponentiation character is “e”. For double precision parameter values are written to model input files using double precision protocol; the maximum parameter value length is 23 characters and the exponentiation symbol is “d”. Double precision is suitable for extremely large and extremely small numbers. These controls refer to the PEST “PRECIS” parameter.

Note: XP-SWMM prepares template files with 10 spaces for PEST to write the parameter values. In some cases more spaces to represent very large or small numbers in double precision may be required. In these cases load the template file into the editor and manually add more spaces.

**Point/Nopoint**

Selecting the radio button on Point or Nopoint instructs PEST to always use or omit the decimal point in the representation of a number if it can when writing the data file. These controls refer to the PEST “DPOINT” parameter.

Note that if a parameter space is 13 characters wide or greater and the precision is “single”, PEST will include the decimal point regardless of the setting of “DPOINT”, for there are no gains to be made in precision through leaving it out. Similarly, if “PRECIS” is set to “double”, no attempt is made to omit a decimal point if the parameter space is 23 characters wide or more.

The table below shows how the setting of DPOINT affects the representation of the number 12345.67. In examining this table, remember that PEST writes a number in such a way that the maximum possible precision is “squeezed” into each parameter space.

xpswmm Reference Manual

**Template File**

**Edit**

Loads the current template file into the editor designated in the SWMXP.INI file. The file will be similar to the data file (DAT) but have PEST ID’s inserted throughout the file separated by a delimiter. Subsequent editing or modification of the template file can then be performed within the editor if required.

**Check**

Checks the syntax of the template file and prepares a data file using the calibration parameter values contained in the parameter file. This is accomplished by sending the template file name and path, the data file (DAT) name and path along with the parameter file name and path to the CHK_TEMPLATE function designated in the SWMXP.INI file. A TEMPCHEK.LOG file is then created and displayed in your current editor displaying all warnings, errors, and confirmation messages.

**7.7.2 Show Errors**

**7.7.1 Solve**

This menu command is used to commence analysis of the network. The data is first checked for consistency and, if it is found to be sound, the network can be analysed and the analysis engine is invoked. Otherwise a window showing all the data inconsistency errors is displayed. The errors and warnings shown may be re-displayed by selecting the "Show Errors " menu command.

The mandatory consistency checks performed at this stage generally concern relationships between data items and are outlined in more detail in Utilities.

If no errors or warnings are detected there will be no errors or warnings listed in the error log. The simulation window will appear and the engine will begin the simulation.

**7.7.2 Show Errors**

Show Errors will re-display the "error.log" file that is created when a network is solved. This enables the user to systematically correct any errors encountered without the need to print the error log or to re-solve the network.

**7.8.7 Dynamic Plan View  
7.8.7 Dynamic Plan View**

The Dynanmic Plan view launches in a 2-pane view. The upper view is the Bird's Eye View. The lower pane shows the color coded view of the network, the model time step and the legend.

Network objects are color coded to indicate the values of various parameters during model simulation. The display options are:

> <u>Object Options</u>  
> Nodes Stage, off
>
> Links Flow, Velocity, off

Display is controlled by the buttons labled “Node”, “Flow”, and “Vel”.

The display of node and link labels is toggled with the button lableled with a flag.

While the animation is running, flow in conduits is indicated by moving slugs. The width of each conduit is proportional to the flow or velocity.

Flooding of nodes is indicated by the graphic.

*(iv) Return to the network window and the Spatial Reports should be correctly displayed. If not then repeat this procedure.*

**Redrawing**

These options control the speed of redrawing and the appearance of the spatial reports.

*Minimize Memory*

When you select this option, reports occupy the minimum space in memory, thus allowing you to load a greater number of nodes. Selecting this option may significantly increase the time taken for redraws.

*Maximize Speed*

When you select this option, reports are drawn significantly faster than the Minimize Memory Option. The trade-off is that more memory is required and hence a smaller number of nodes can be handled.

*Hide Inactive Fields*

This field controls whether fields with no data will be displayed. If this flag is OFF fields without data will be displayed as blank lines within the report.

*Hide Blank Reports*

This flag controls whether reports with no data will be displayed, ie all the fields are blank. Objects with no data will then not display any Spatial Report.

Note that an object with no attached Spatial Report on the screen does not imply that there is no data there. Spatial Reports can also be hidden/shown from the “Display Reports” menu command, and may also be hidden if the “Hide on Creation” flag is enabled when the node/link is created. Thus, to confirm whether data exists, you need to “Show” Spatial reports for that node/link; if no Spatial Report appears, then you can safely assume no data exists.

**Text Size**

*Display Size*

With this option selected the text size is shown in a constant size (mm or inches) regardless of the scale selected.

*Real World Coordinates*

When this option is selected the text will be shown relative to the scale of the drawing. As you zoom in the text will get larger.

> Occasionally it is necessary to perform routing on the water that floods onto the ground. A new conduit is constructed by the user to transport the flooded water from the ground elevation of the upstream junction to the ground elevation of the downstream junction. It is not necessary to simulate manholes as vertical pipes in order to transport water. With this arrangement, water may surcharge (move vertically out of a “manhole-pipe”) and return to the sewer system at a downstream location through another “manhole-pipe” after traversing an overland channel.

SECTION 8: NODES

> <img src="./media/image286.png" style="width:5.92639in;height:4.32014in" />

The **surcharge elevation** of a node is computed automatically by the Hydraulics mode during the simulation. For a node connected only to closed top conduits (i.e. pipes), it is defined as the crown elevation of the highest connecting pipe.

If an open channel is connected to a node, the spill crest (elevation where surface flooding occurs) should be set at the elevation where the HGL exceeds the defined maximum depth of the cross-section. A run time error will be generated if it is not. If the spill crest elevation is higher than the top of the bank of a connecting open channel and the water level is above the top of the channel, Table E10 of the output file a warning indicating this as a source of model error. It is important that cross-sections are defined to be large enough to convey the peak flow.

The configuration parameter VERT_WALLS causes xpswmm to add vertical walls to the ground elevation specified by the spill crest of the nodes.

The spill crest is used to define upper boundary of HGL in the network. Normally this is the street or ground elevation; however, if the manholes are bolted down the spill crest” should be set sufficiently high so that the simulated water surface elevation does not exceed it. This can be automated at the node by selecting the Sealed option for ponding and no adjustment of the spill crest is required.

When the hydraulic head must exceed the spill crest to maintain continuity at the node, the program allows the excess flow to overflow onto the ground and depending on the Ponding value selected it may become lost to the system for the remainder of the simulation period. These assumptions may be modified using the surface ponding options in this dialog.

Ponding

Ponding is the management of the water when the HGL reaches the spill crest (ground elevation). The available ponding options are:

***None***

The default mechanism is for surcharged water that breaks the ground surface to be lost from the network. The duration and amount of water lost is tabulated in the output file in Table E20 and is also available using most of the Results decision support tools (DSS) located in the Results menu**.**

409

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> ***Allowed***
>
> This option is for junction flood storage. Using this option, the flooded water will be stored at this node until the connected conduits can handle the excess flow.
>
> By enabling this check box an artificial storage is created at the surface level of this node. The storage is of the form: Ponding Area = *A e* ^ (*B* \* Surface Depth)
>
> Water is allowed to pond until there is sufficient hydraulic capacity within the system for it to rejoin the network. The coefficient *A* and exponent *B* for the above equation may be modified in the Junction Defaults section of the Job Control Dialog. The values are reported in the Job Control Section of the output file.
>
> This should only be used as a quick estimate of flood storage. If a significant volume of water is ponded then a more detailed Storage Node should be entered at this location to represent the actual storage relationship.
>
> ***Sealed***
>
> Using this option the hydraulic grade line will rise above the ground surface spill crest but no volume is lost. It is accomplished internally by projecting the default node area upward to contain the water, which allows the HGL to rise above the surface, which creates pressure but no flow is lost. It is most commonly used for the connection of pumps to force mains and nodes that are placed for welded joints in siphons.
>
> **Link Spill Crest to 2D**
>
> Using this option the water that would normally spill out of the system is linked and passed to the 2D grid for overland flow routing. At this location there is a continuity balance with the 2D grid as the water leaving the node is the amount of water received by the grid at the common cell. In addition 2D grid flows can enter the node if the HGL is below the surface level of the node. Flows can be restricted into the node using the 2D Inflow Capture. It is important in this type of model construct that the spill crest of the node match the cell elevation. This ensures that the node does not rise above the 2D grid like a smokestack preventing water to be captured unless a very large depth is on the surface. A tool is available to generate ground elevations from a TIN.
>
> Note: When a node is linked to a 2D cell and Inlet Capacity option is invoked, the Rated by Approach Depth and the Calculate Depth by Node Storage Characteristics are recommended options.
>
> This option must also be selected in 1D/2D river simulations. If there is a node with 1D/2D Connections then the Link Spill Crest to 2D must also be selected in order to create a valid 2D boundary condition with the node. Simply connecting the node with the 1D/2D Connection polyline is not enough.
>
> **Link Invert to 2D**
>
> This special case is used to connect culverts to the 2D Grid. The water that is flowing on the 2D Grid can directly enter the upstream node of the culvert using the node invert. Ideally this invert matches the cell elevation. The culvert upstream invert can be above this level if it is perched above the ground. To link the culvert exit to the 2D grid the downstream node would also have the Link Invert to 2D. The invert elevations can be set to the TIN elevation using the Tools-\>Modify Elevations-\>Read Inverts from TIN files.

***Time***

Time of day in decimal hours, 0 is midnight on the starting day of the simulation entered in the Hydraulics Job Control dialog. The time does not re-start at zero and should increase past 24 if necessary.

***Flow Rate***

Flow rate for the corresponding time (ft<sup>3</sup>/s or m<sup>3</sup>/s).

It may also be used to add additional input hydrographs, either at the same or different nodes to those available in the Interface File. Hydrograph time input points can be specified at any convenient time. Only one user hydrograph is permitted per node. When multiple flows must enter a node they must be summed external to the program or passed to the node through an interface file or other pathway.

>
> The Inlet Capacity option allows for flow to subsurface conduits downstream of a node to be restricted by an Inlet Rating Curve (IRC). For these calculations, inlet flow is the sum of the Times Series Inflow (User Inflow + Gauged Inflow + Dry Weather Flow) + Interface File Flow + flow routed to node in open channels).
>
> The Inlet Rating Curve works as follows:

- If Ponding None and no surface conduits - Divert flow according to the selected IRC method and lose excess.

- If Ponding None with surface conduits - Divert flow according to the selected IRC method and excess distributed according to hydraulic properties of surface conduits. Any excess that cannot be re-distributed is lost.

- If Ponding Allowed and no surface conduits - Divert flow according to the selected IRC method with excess ponding at the surface. Ponded surface water is added to the diverted flow at a flow rate equivalent to the volume of surface water divided by the time step. The maximum total diverted flow however is capped at either the "Maximum Capacity" or at the maximum value entered in the rating curve so do not enter unrealistically high capture rates even if they have equally unrealistic approach flows because the approach flow is ignored when determining the absolute maximum allowed.

- If Ponding Allowed with surface conduits - Divert flow according to the selected IRC method and excess distributed according to hydraulic properties of surface conduits. Any excess that cannot be re-distributed is ponded as per 3 above with the total diverted flow increased accordingly.

- If the underground conduit has a constriction that causes reverse flow through the inlet then all the excess underground flow discharges back to the surface regardless of the inlet's maximum capacity (it blows its lid).

> Whenever Inlet Capacity is turned on at a node, a second node is created, for computational purposes, with the text \$I appended to the name. This new node is connected to the closed conduit and receives flow by an internal rating curve based on the inlet capacity. Results for this node are reported in the output file. In the Review Results graphical display, the new node is labeled as \[Subsurface\]. When inlet capacity is selected, it is possible that two HGL profiles will be shown in the long section results view. This is due to the second node which is created.

> The Inlet Capacity may be entered as a manhole or pit rating curve of Approach Flow versus Captured Flow. The “Captured” component of the rating curve is adjusted by the Efficiency Factor entered in this dialog.
>
> A couple of side effects are that, firstly, if ponding is allowed the maximum diverted flow may be greater than expected particularly if using an inlet rating curve, and secondly, the flow in the conduit may be greater than the diverted inflow. This is because a volume of water (equivalent to the flow rate) is diverted and this water is then converted to a flow rate in the conduit according to the pipes hydraulic characteristics. If the pipe is initially dry you might see a higher peak in the pipe flow rate than the flow rate being diverted. Secondly, the rating curve should have a zero, zero pair so that with no approach flow there will not be any captured flow. A non zero value for captured flow will be introduced with no approach flow resulting in continuity error if the first pair of data is 0, X with X being a non zero captured flow.

**Design Option 4: Resize of d/s Pipes and Basin**

Required Input: Maximum Water Level of Storage Node Basin and Maximum Flow Values for Outlet conduits

Method Result: This method first designs the basin as outlined in Design Option 3 (Resize Basin). If a sufficient size is found, the flows on the out conduits are checked. If a flow limit is exceeded, the pipe size is decreased as in Design Option 2 (Limit d/s Discharges) and the method restarts with designing the basin. The complete restart is necessary since decreasing the outflow will cause an increase of the HGL.

Note: This method can require a lot of restarts. However, asymptotically it will produce results that come close to the specified values. If the pipes were replaced every time a flow limit is exceeded, less restarts would be required, however, this replacement might not have been necessary as the basin could have been replaced later causing the HGL to fall and subsequently the outflow making the replacement unnecessary. That is the reason why the above method has been chosen.

> Outfall**
>
> Four types of outfall configurations can be simulated in the Hydraulics layer:

- a single conduit with or without a tide gate,

- and a diversion (orifice, weir, pump etc.) with or without a tide gate.

> While you can have any number of outfalls, you cannot have multiple conduits connected to the same outfall.
>

>
> The outfall is a conduit which discharges to a receiving water body under given backwater conditions. The free outfall may be truly "free" if the elevation of the receiving waters is low enough, or it may consist of a backwater condition. In the former case, the water surface at the free outfall is taken as critical depth, normal depth or whichever is less. If backwater exists, the receiving water elevation is taken as the water surface elevation at the free outfall unless the normal or critical depth is greater.
>
> A weir outfall is a weir which discharges directly to the receiving waters according to relationships given in the weir section. This outfall type is further described in **Section 9 - Hydraulics Multiple Conduit and Diversion Link Data** .
>
> **Tide Gate (JFREE orJGATE)**
>
> If this flag is enabled the outfall is assumed to have a tide (flap) gate and back-flow is not permitted. When there is a tide gate on an outfall conduit, a check is made to see whether or not the hydraulic head at the upstream end of the outfall pipe exceeds that outside the gate. If it does not, the discharge through the outfall is equated to zero. If the driving head is positive the water surface elevation at the outfall junction is set in the same manner as that for a free outfall subjected to a backwater condition.
>

> **Note: When using the SCS and SBUH methods a curve number of 98 will be used for this amount of impervious area and a composite number will be generated internally. Use a value of 0 if you wish xpswmm to use your composite number entered as the Pervious CN.**
>
> The impervious areas must be hydraulically (directly) connected to the drainage system. Rooftops draining onto adjacent pervious areas should not be treated as effective impervious areas.
>
> The percent impervious data is used to split the subarea into respective impervious and pervious components. It should be noted that Horton or Green Ampt infiltration is only applied to pervious component. The only losses applied to impervious component are depression storage losses. To apply Horton type losses to both components requires the use of two subareas and the setting of both percent impervious values to zero. This will allow the Horton type infiltration to be applied to the full area of each subarea.

> The following regression equation relating imperviousness to population density, known as the New Jersey equation (Stankowski, 1974), is perhaps the most representative:

> I = 9.6 PD (0.53 - 0.0391 log10 PD)
>
> Where:

> I = imperviousness, percent
>
> PD = population density in developed portion of the urbanized area, persons/acre.
>
> The "developed portion" excludes large segments of undeveloped lands that may lie within the area being simulated. The above relation was developed for large (city-wide) areas as a whole so its use may be tenuous for small subcatchments.
>
> **Subcatchment Width (WW1)**
>
> Width of subcatchment, ft \[m\]. This parameter is only applicable to the Runoff and Kinematic Wave routing methods. For all other methods enter any valid number (\>0), the parameter will not impact the solution.
>
> If overland flow is visualized as running down-slope off an idealized rectangular catchment, then the width of the subcatchment is the physical width of overland flow. Since real subcatchments will not be rectangular with properties of symmetry and uniformity other procedures are required.
>
> The subcatchment width is a key calibration parameter, one of the few that can significantly alter the hydrograph shape, rather than just runoff volume. A good estimate for the width is the area of the subcatchment divided by the average path length of overland flow.
>
> For rainfall durations less than the time of concentration, increasing the width increases the flow peak and decreases time to peak. For rainfall durations greater than the time of concentration, the peak flow is affected only marginally. The time of concentration is reduced slightly for larger widths.
>
> Irregularly shaped catchments with drainage channels off-centre can be handled by computing a skew factor:
>
> Sk = (A2 - A1) / A
>
> W = (2 - Sk) \* L
>
> where
>
> Sk = skew factor
>
> A1 = area to one side of the channel
>
> A2 = area to other side of the channel
>
> A = total area
>
> W = subcatchment width
>
> L = length of main drainage channel
>
> When using Laurenson Hydrology the subcatchment width is by default not used. The catchment roughness utilised when calculating the storage delay parameter “B” is taken from the pervious Manning "n" value for the sub-catchment included with the infiltration information. A second method is available by including the Configuration parameter RAFTS under the tools menu. This allows **%** imp to be set to 0 and 0 in the first two separate sub areas. This will allow the infiltration equation to be applied to the total subareas. Width is then used as a factor to control the “B” computation by inputting 0.0 and 100.0 respectively for the fully pervious and impervious sub areas. Appropriate infiltration can then be applied to the respective subareas.

> **Subcatchment Slope (WSLOPE)**
>
> Average slope of the subcatchment, non dimensional (m/m or ft/ft). For example a 1% slope is entered as 0.01. The subcatchment slope should reflect the average along the pathway of overland flow to inlet locations. For simple geometry, the calculation is simply the elevation difference divided by the length of flow. For more complex shapes, several overland flow paths may be delineated, their slopes determined, and a weighted slope computed using a path-length weighted average. Alternatively, it may be sufficient to simulate the hydrologically dominant slope for the conditions being simulated. It is possible to include a Configuration parameter to change the slope to a percentage if preferred.

> **Sacramento Method**
>
> Sacramento County, California, USA has been estimating runoff flows for the design of drainage facilities since the early 1960's using charts and equations developed by George S. Nolte Consulting Civil Engineers. Use of these charts
>
> and equations has historically been referred to as the Nolte method. The City of Sacramento has used constant unit discharge rates similar to those given on the Nolte charts for small areas.
>
> More recently, the City and County of Sacramento have developed the Sacramento method, based on the Bureau of
>
> Reclamation urban unit hydrograph. The new method takes advantage of the advances in computer modeling techniques and the availability of current rainfall and runoff data. The Sacramento method can be used for all drainage design but is especially suited for design of large drainage facilities and masterplanning studies.

> Flow from each sub-area moves directly to a node and does not travel over any other sub-area. The width of the pervious sub-area, A2, is the entire subcatchment width, whereas the width of the impervious sub-areas A1, A3, A4 are in proportion to the ratio of their area to the total impervious area. Subcatchments are analyzed as spatially lumped non-linear reservoirs. The routing is performed separately for each of the four sub-areas (A1-A4) of the catchment.
>
> **Kinematic Wave (Runoff)**
>
> The kinematic wave method for overland flow applies only the kinematic wave component of the St Venant shallow flow equations for momentum and continuity. Similar to the Runoff procedure the Subcatchments are modelled as idealised rectangular areas with the slope of the catchment perpendicular to the width. The width parameter is used as per the Runoff procedure. Both the Runoff and Kinematic wave procedures only apply either the Horton or Green Ampt loss to the pervious percentage of the subarea, as defined by the % impervious data item. The only loss applied to the impervious component is via the depression storage defined for the impervious area in the infiltration dialog. Additional depression loss (defined with infiltration information) can also be applied to the pervious component. This will be an additional loss to the Horton or Green Ampt loss.

> Henderson and Wooding (1964) and Wooding (1965) developed a theory for the overland and stream hydrograph. All flows are assumed to obey the equations of continuity and momentum.

> When using Laurenson Hydrology the subcatchment width is by default not used. The catchment roughness utilised when calculating the storage delay parameter “B” is taken from the pervious Manning "n" value for the sub-catchment included with the infiltration information. A second method is available by including the Configuration parameter RAFTS under the Configuration menu. This allows **%** imp to be set to 0 and 0 in the first two separate sub areas. This will allow the infiltration equation to be applied to the total subareas. Width is then used as a factor to control the “B” computation by inputting 0.0 and 100.0 respectively for the fully pervious and impervious sub areas. Appropriate infiltration can then be applied to the respective subareas.

A second method is available by including the Configuration parameter RAFTS under the tools menu. This allows **%** imp to be set to 0 and 0 in the first two separate sub areas. This will allow the infiltration equation to be applied to the total subareas. Width is then used as a factor to control the “B” computation by inputting 0.0 and 100.0 respectively for the fully pervious and impervious sub areas. Appropriate infiltration can then be applied to the respective subareas.

> ***Pervious Area Curve Number***
>
> The runoff curve number as described in NEH-4 Chapter 9. Typical values vary from 20 for regions with high infiltration and interception capacities to 98 for impervious areas.
>
> **Note: This CN number is applied only to the pervious area. Internally, an area weighted composite number is generated using this number for the pervious area and 98 for the impervious area.**
>
> It is a dimensionless number depending on hydrologic soil group, cover type, treatment, hydrological condition, and antecedent moisture conditions. This number has a valid range from 0 to 100 with typical values from 60 to 90 and 98 for impervious surfaces.
>
> ***Shape Factor***
>
> The shape factor or peak rate factor as defined in NEH-4 Chapter 16. The typical value is 484 for a hydrograph where the volume under the falling side of the triangular unit hydrograph is equal to 1.67 times the volume under the rising limb of the curvilinear unit hydrograph. Actual values may vary from 100 in very flat swampy country to 800 in steep rocky terrain.
>
> The Soil Conservation Service has been determined the hydrograph shape factor to be 484 for most watersheds. This was the result of analyzing many watersheds of various size and geographic location. It is used in the formulation of peak discharge and the peak of the unit hydrograph:
>
> Qp=484A/tp
>
> in which Qp is the peak discharge in cfs A is the drainage area mi'2 and tp is the time to peak in hr. Several other values have been used for shape factor within Florida and other areas of the country for wetlands, sandy soils and steep terrain. Typical values in Florida include 323 or 256 and values as low as 100. Effectively, the hydrograph shape factor will lengthen the time base of the unit hydrograph and lower the peak. If you are using real rainfall data this parameter can be used for calibration. For example the falling limb time base of the hydrograph will be double when using a shape factor of 300 instead of 484.
>
> A curvilinear or triangular shape may be chosen by selecting the appropriate button. Both shapes are supported for the entire range of hydrograph shape factors.
>
> ***Time of Concentration***
>
> The time of concentration as described in NEH-4 Chapter 15 (in mins) is defined in two ways; the time for runoff to travel from the furthermost point of the watershed to the point in question, and the time from the end of excess rainfall to the point of inflection on the trailing limb of the unit hydrograph. Tc can be estimated from several formula such as Kinematic-wave. For a constant excess rainfall can be described as:
>
> Tc=C(n'0.6 L'0.6/i'0.4 S'0.3)
>
> in which L is the distance from the upper end of the plane to the point of interest (usually the inlet) n is the Manning resistance coefficient, i is the excess rainfall rate, S is the dimensionless slope of the surface, and C is a constant that depends on units of the other variables. For tc in minutes, i in inches/hr and L in feet C equals 0.938. For tc in minutes i in mm/hr and L in meters C equals 6.99.
>
> Another formula for determining tc is the lag equation
>
> Tc = L/0.6 where L= l'0.8(S+1)'0.7/1900Y'0.5
>
> Tc = time of concentration in hours

467

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> L = lag time in hours
>
> I = hydraulic length of the watershed in feet
>
> Y = Average land slope in percent
>
> S = Potential maximum retention in inches
>
> CN = weighted Curve Number
>
> The time of concentration is required as input although internally the time to peak is used in creating the unit hydrograph. Tp=2/3 Tc for shape factor 484.
>
> ***Calc:*** The time of concentration can be calculated using the TC_Calculator
>
> ***Initial Abstraction***
>
> The initial abstraction from the precipitation may be represented as an absolute number, that is the total depth of precipitation that is less (in mm or inches) or as a fraction of the amount of precipitation (between 0 to 1).
>
> Initial Abstraction, Ia, contains all the loss terms prior to beginning of runoff. All though it was found to be highly variable for many small agricultural watersheds it was found that
>
> Ia = 0.2 × S
>
> Where S = (1000/CN)-10
>
> S is the potential maximum abstraction.
>
> XP allows the user to use a fraction with .2 being the default or the Initial abstraction can be a depth in inches or mm.

The typical use of this value is to represent a remote catchment connected by a pipe or drain without explicitly modeling the connecting conduit itself. To allow for gutter travel time, an equivalent length of overland path should be added to the overland flow length.

By routing a unit inflow through the reservoirs, a mathematical equation for instantaneous unit hydrograph can be derived. Two items of data are required to apply this method. These include an Exponent and a Time of concentration. This method requires calibration data to base input data.

> The Rational method as applied by this method uses a unit hydrograph approach applying a deterministic form of the Rational formula Q = CIA. The two items of data needed for this procedure are the sub-area runoff coefficient “C” and time of concentration tc. The method utilizes the rainfall concurrent to the time step being computed. The unit hydrograph incorporates a base length equal to two times the time of concentration.
>
> This method is currently not recommended without calibration data or for models with storage nodes and significant attenuation.

> *Santa Barbara Urban Hydrograph Procedure*
>
> The SBUH method, like the Soil Conservation Service Urban Hydrograph (SCSUH) method, is based on the curve number (CN) approach, and also uses SCS equations for computing soil absorption and precipitation excess. The SCSUH method works by converting the incremental runoff depths (precipitation excess) for a given basin and design storm hydrographs of equal time base according to basin time of concentration and adds them to form the runoff hydrograph. The SBUH method, on the other hand, converts the incremental runoff depths into instantaneous hydrographs which are then routed through an imaginary reservoir with a time delay equal to the basin time of concentration.

> Once the percentage is set to 0% it means that your whole catchment will be subject to infiltration. If you are using the Curve Number method for infiltration, you can account for the impervious parts of your catchment by modifying the curve number (CN) that is used for the infiltration accordingly. We recommend a CN value of 98 for the impervious part of the catchment. I have seen that you are using CN=78 for the pervious parts of your subcatchments. If your catchment is say 30% imperviousness, you should now set CN to 0.7\*78 + 0.3\*98 = 84. You can also check the total infiltration volume in Table R5 of the output file.

> *Snyder (Alameda) Unit Hydrograph Procedure*

> The Snyder (Alameda) method is the Snyder procedure as applied by Alameda County in California where the individual parameters more suited to Alameda region are computed from catchment characteristics.
>
> This method requires four items of data:
>
> Stream Length (L) mile  
> Centroid Length (Lc) mile  
> Stream Slope (S) ft/mile  
> Basin “N” (roughness)

> Lag = K.N ( (L . Lc) / S 1/2) 0.38

>
> *Time Area Method*
>
> Time-area methods utilise a convolution of the rainfall excess hyetograph with a time-area diagram representing the progressive area contributions within a catchment in set time increments. Separate hydrographs are generated for the impervious and pervious surfaces within the catchment. These are combined to estimate the total flow inputs to individual sub-catchment entries to the underground urban drain network.
>
> The time-area method dates from the research of Ross in 1922. Networked urban drainage adoptions of the procedure however only date back to 1963. This computerised program known as the TRRL Method was developed by the U.K. Transport and Road Research Laboratory, described by Watkins (1963). In the U.S. Terstriep and Stall (1974) further developed the method to include pervious runoff. In South Africa Watson (1981) made a number of additional changes particularly to the way infiltration was estimated. Between 1982 and 1986 O’Loughlin (1988) using Watson’s model as a basis carried out extensive changes once again to formulate a computerised package known as ILSAX. Over the intervening years to the present the ILSAX model has had wide usage throughout Australia particularly for routine urban drainage design. The sub-catchment runoff estimating procedure still utilises the basic time-area method to estimate both pervious and impervious portion runoff.
>
> In this application the time/area procedure assumes a linear time area relationship for the subarea and is based on an input time of concentration. It is recommended in urban catchments to define two subarea elements one each to represent the impervious and pervious areas respectively. Values for Impervious% should both be set to 0 (zero) so the input infiltration using either Horton or Green Ampt applies to the full defined area of each. Depression storage loss as defined in the infiltration dialog is currently unused.

>
> The Clark method (1945) requires three parameters to calculate a unit hydrograph: Tc, the time of concentration for the basin, R, a storage coefficient, and a time-area curve. A time-area curve defines the cumulative area of the watershed contributing runoff to the subcatchment outlet as a function of time (expressed as a proportion of Tc).
>
> xswmm utilizes a dimensionless time area curve:

> *AI* = 1.414 *T* '1.5 for 0 \<= *T* \< 0.5

>
> where:
>
> A*I* = cumulative area as a fraction of total subcatchment area and  
> *T* = fraction of time of concentration.
>
> The ordinates of the time-area curve are converted to volume of runoff per second for unit excess and interpolated to the given time interval. The resulting translation hydrograph is then routed through a linear reservoir to simulate the storage effects of the basin; and the resulting unit hydrograph for instantaneous excess is averaged to produce the hydrograph for unit excess occurring in the given time interval.
>

> Conduit data is shared amongst all three modes: Runoff, Sanitary, and Hydraulics. Each layer (module) routes flow differently, increasing in complexity in the order above. The Sanitary layer uses a Kinematic Wave approach for conduit routing, in which disturbances are allowed to propagate only in the downstream direction. As a consequence, backwater effects are not modeled beyond the realm of a single conduit, and downstream conditions (eg. tide gates, diversion structures) do not affect upstream computations.
>
> Surcharging is modeled by storing excess flows, above the full flow conduit capacity at the upstream node until capacity exists to accept the stored volume. Pressure flow conditions are not explicitly modeled and no attempt is made to determine if ground surface flooding exists. If the network has extensive interconnections or loops, flow reversals, significant backwater effects, or pressure flows, then the Hydraulics layer (module) should be used for flow routing.

SECTION 9: LINKS

total conveyance for the cross section is obtained by summing the three subdivision conveyances (left, channel, and right).

**Default Conveyance Subdivision Method**

**Channel Slope**

***(SPHI)** -* The average channel slope for this cross-section. This slope is used only for developing a rating curve for the channel. Routing calculations use invert elevation differences divided by length.

**Vertical Shift**

***(PXSECE)** -* A constant value (+ or -) to be added to the elevation data in the "section coordinates" dialog box to raise or lower the cross-section.

**Horizontal Distortion Factor**

***(PXSECR)** -* Modification factor for the data in the Section Coordinates dialog box. The distances between adjacent stations (chainages) are multiplied by this factor to expand or narrow a cross-section.

**Maximum Channel Depth**

***(DEEP)** -* This parameter is used to denote the maximum height of a natural channel and will exclude points above this level for analysis. It is a shared field with other conduit shapes and represents the diameter of circular or the height of other shapes.

By default this value is zero and the maximum channel depth is computed as the difference between the high point of the cross-section and low point of the cross-section (as described below). A non-zero value may be entered to reduce the total cross-section depth if the maximum depth of flow for a particular simulation is significantly less than the maximum cross-section depth. This will increase the accuracy of the interpolation performed by the model. If the spill crest level at any connecting node is greater than the derived elevation from maximum depth plus invert then the conduit could be under pressure since the HGL could be above its height. This is reported in the output file Table E10 with a \* at the end of the line.

Obviously, a pressurized natural channel is not a common physical occurrence and this is avoided by allowing vertical walls to be created up to the node spillcrest elevations while using the configuration parameter VERT_WALLS. One application of allowing this to occur would be for flow under a bridge deck.

The low point in the cross-section is the lowest point between the left and right Main Channel Stations. The high point is the highest point of the cross-section coordinates. If the left-most or right-most elevations are less than the high point, vertical sides are projected up to the high point to complete the section shape.

The following checks are made for this parameter:

1.  No warnings or errors are given in dialogs or XP Tables for DEEP.

2.  On solving all conduits except natural channels are checked for DEEP \< 0.01m (metric models) or 0.03ft (imperial models). An error message is given for any conduits failing this limit.

525

> xpswmm Reference Manual

5.  On solving all conduits except natural channels are checked for 0.05m \<= DEEP \<= 30.0m (metric models) or 0.15ft \<= DEEP \<= 100.0ft (imperial models). A warning message is given for any conduits failing this.

6.  If the configuration parameter NATDEEP_0.05 is present, natural channels are treated the same as other conduits in \#2 and \#3 above.

> **Upstream Invert Level of Natural Channel**
>
> **Channel *(ZP) ****-* Elevation (R.L.) of the channel invert at the upstream node (feet or metres). By convention in XP-SWMM the upstream end of a conduit is the end that, on the plan view, does not have the arrowhead.
>
> **Downstream Invert Level of Natural Channel**
>
> ***(ZP)** -* Elevation (R.L.) of the channel invert at the downstream node (feet or metres). By convention in XP-SWMM the downstream end of a conduit is the end that, on the plan view, has the arrowhead. (Not necessary in Runoff or Sanitary layers.)
>
> **Left Overbank Manning's 'n'**
>
> ***(XNL)** -* Channel roughness of the left-hand overbank as described by Manning's n.
>
> Typical values for Manning's n can be found from hydraulic texts and other engineering references. A sample table from the United States Department of transportation – Federal Highway Administration showing a typical range of Manning’s n values for open channels can be found here.

HEC-2 type natural surface cross-section coordinate pairs. Elevations are used only to determine the shape of the cross-section. Invert elevations are defined in the node data dialog box and also by the Upstream and Downstream Elevations shown in this dialog.

The low point in the cross-section is the lowest point between the left and right Main Channel Stations. The high point is the highest point of the cross-section coordinates. If the left-most or right-most elevations are less than this value, vertical sides are projected up to the high point. Total cross-section depth is computed as the difference between the high point of the cross-section and low point of the cross-section (as described above).

The profile is defined in terms of station **(x)** and stage **(elevation).  
Main Channel Definition 'x'**

***(C3 or X1 - STCHL, X1 - STCHR)** -* The station (chainage) of the left bank and right bank of the main channel (feet or metres). The station (chainage) should be the same as one of the values in the "Section Coordinates" dialog box. If an invalid station is entered an interpolated value is inserted at the station entered.

**Cross-Section Profile Station**

***(STA..)** -* Station (chainage) of the cross-section (feet or metres). Stations must be in increasing order progressing from left to right across the section. Cross-sections are normally orientated looking downstream.

2)  **Right Bank Only**: The right bank will be reduced by imposing a vertical wall from the greatest station and moving to the left until the maximum depth increase has been met.

3)  **Equal Left and Right Bank Reduction**: The left and right banks will be reduced by imposing vertical walls from the farthest stations and moving in equal distance until the maximum depth increase has been met.

4)  **Symetrical About Centerline**: The left and right banks will be reduced by imposing vertical walls equal distance from the centerline of the channel and moving in until the maximum depth increase has been met.

5)  **Equal Left and Right Conveyance Reduction**: The left and right banks will be reduced by imposing vertical walls that cause equal conveyance reduction in both overbanks and moving in until the maximum depth increase has been met.

1)  Pump Rated by Well Volume: An in-line or off-line pump station with a wet well; the rate of pumping depends upon the volume (level) of water in the wet well.

2)  Pump Rated by Depth in Node: An in-line or off-line lift station that pumps according to the level of the water surface at the junction being pumped.

3)  Pump Rated By Dynamic Head: An in-line or off-line pump that pumps according to the head difference over the pump using a multi point pump curve and starting and stopping elevations.

4)  Pump Rated By Static Head: An in-line or off-line pump that pumps according to the head at the upstream node using a multi point pump curve and starting and stopping elevations.

5)  A dynamic head pump that uses a rule curve to modify the behavior of the dynamic head pump based on the depth at either an adjacent or non-adjacent node.

- internal diversions (from one junction to another via a transverse or sideflow weir),

- outfall weirs which discharge to the receiving waters. These weirs may be transverse or sideflow types, and may be equipped with flap gates that prevent backflow

- special weir types including **<u>Inflatable Weirs</u>** (regulators), **<u>Bendable Weirs</u>** and **<u>User-defined Weirs</u>** .

> Transverse weir and sideflow weirs are distinguished in the Hydraulics layer by the value of the exponent to which the head on the weir is taken. For transverse weirs, head is taken to the power of 1.5 while for sideflow weirs the exponent is 1.667.

A weir not in a closed structure may also require an elevation to commence orifice flow if it is a horizontal opening for an outlet structure of a pond. To eliminate orifice flow calculations set this elevation equal to the upstream node spillcrest value. Elevation of the weir crown uses units of (feet or metres).

> Frequently, weirs are installed together with a tide gate at points of overflow into the receiving waters. Flow across the weir is restricted by reducing the effective driving head across the weir according to an empirical factor published by Armco(3). Note that the flap gate is only effective for a weir at an outfall node. A flap gate is ignored for a weir between two internal nodes.

This may lead to considerable flattening of a hydrograph peak when routed through a cascade of conduits. No backwater effects can be simulated.

The Save Results Every time step will be larger than the simulation Time Step and will produce hydrographs with fewer points than what is calculated in the simulation. This will cause the reported peak results values in Review Results, Dynamic Long Section and Dynamic Section Views to be less than the actual peak values taken from the entire simulation, which are reported in the \*.out file and within XP-Tables.
>
> **Time Step (DELT)**
>
> The length of the time step in seconds. Dynamic wave models run best between 1 & 2 times the Courant time step. Since the velocity, area, and depth of flow in a conduit varies with time, the time step should be adjusted dynamically during the simulation. A fixed time step model will not allow for the necessary reduction in time step required to ensure stability unless a small time step guaranteed to be lower than any possible required time step is used.
>
> This version of xpswmm uses a variable time step. The time step entered is the maximum allowable time step that the program will use during the simulation. The program will select the current time step and iterate to a converged solution taking into account the under-relaxation parameter, omega. The solution is expected to converge in any given time step, provided at least 50 to 100 time step iterations \[MFAIL\] are allowed by the user.
>
> The time step specified here has little effect on the stability of the simulation run provided you do not force a very short time step. The time step should be selected according to the following guidelines:

1)  An excessive number of iterations at a junction is a sure indication that the time step you have chosen is too large and that for optimal results the largest time step (DELT) should be reduced.

2)  The summary printout lists the average time step used during the simulation. You may use this as a basis for selecting a new time step. For example, having selected a target time step of 30 seconds you find that the average time step was approximately 17 seconds. A better target time step may be 15 seconds because the solution will converge faster and the simulation run time will be reduced.

3)  The summary printout lists the average number and total number of iterations at each node. Nodes with a high number of iterations should be investigated and may indicate a problem.

> The model will select the current time step based on the smallest conduit Courant time step at the beginning of each long time step. It then determines the number of equal length small time steps required to equal the length of the long time steps.

>
> **Under Relaxation Parameter (OMEGA)**
>
> The under relaxation parameter used during the simulation. It typically has values between 0.60 and 0.85 and should be used in conjunction with the Time-weighting factor (THETA) to minimise hunting and seeking behaviour. The parameter is used in the following way in the program:
>
> Newest = New \* omega + (1-omega)\*Old
>
> where Old = Value at previous iteration,
>
> New = New iteration value, and
>
> Newest = Weighted new value after under-relaxation.  
> **Time Weighting Parameter (THETA)**
>
> The implicit time weighting for all conduits. Typically, this parameter should have a value between 0.55 and 1.0. This parameter is used to decrease the oscillations in “hunting and seeking”.
>
> **Conduit Roughness Factor (FMAX)**
>
> A global adjustment to conduit roughness. Used as an aid in calibration of your model. The conduit roughness is multiplied by this factor (i.e. a value of 1.20 increases the roughness by 20 percent). The default value = 1.0, or no change.
>
> **Flow Adjustment Factor (QREF)**
>
> A global adjustment factor for all flows from the interface file and user-defined time series. This allows the user to globally alter the inflows to the model by a constant factor.
>
> **Initial Condition Smoothing (ISMTH)**
>
> Instead of using a hot start file to make the initial conduit conditions smoother it is now possible to use a new parameter, ISMTH, to dampen oscillations arising from the choice of initial conditions. This parameter works as follows:
>
> ISMTH = 0 All conduits use their normal roughness.
>
> ISMTH \> 0 All conduits have their roughness increased by a factor of ten for ISMTH time steps.
>
> The increase in roughness has a dampening effect on the potential buildup of initial transients. Typical values of ISMTH would be 10 to 100 time steps.
>
> **Minimum Courant Time Step Factor (FMIN)**
>
> As part of the solution the model calculates the minimum courant time step at each big time step based on the previous conduit depth and velocity. The time step used in the model is based on the calculated courant time step multiplied by the courant time factor. The default time step factor is 1.0, and typical values are 0.5 to 3.0.
>
> **Max. Time Step Iterations**
>
> The maximum number of iterations allowed during a time step. Typically, the maximum number should be 50 to 100. If convergence is not achieved by this number of iterations then the model moves on to the next time step and accepts the last value computed.
>
> **Report Non-Convergence**
>
> By selecting this option the model will display, during run-time, those junctions that fail to reach convergence by the time the maximum number of iterations it reached. The model reports to the screen the junction name and the junction heads of the current and previous iteration. If no junctions are reported then all junctions reached convergence.

> The Explicit method uses the Modified Euler technique to arrive at a solution to the St Venant equations. The modified Euler method yields a totally explicit solution in which the motion equation is applied to discharge in each link and the continuity equation to head at each node, with implicit coupling during the time step.
>
> **Enhanced Explicit Solution (ISOL=1)**
>
> The Enhanced Explicit solution differs from the default Explicit solution in the representation of the gradually varied, one-dimensional unsteady flow equations for open channels. The main advantage of this technique over the default Explicit method is an increase in the stability of the calculations. Consequently the user may select longer time steps for the simulation with a corresponding saving in computation time. This method is fully described in Appendix A of the EXTRAN Addendum of the US-EPA SWMM-4 manual.

>
> **Background Information (Modify Conduits)**
>
> An equivalent pipe is the computational substitution of an actual element of the drainage system by an imaginary conduit which is hydraulically identical to the element it replaces (except for volume). Usually, an equivalent pipe is used when it is suspected that a numerical instability will be caused by the element of the drainage system being replaced in the computation.
>
> Weirs and short conduits are known at times to require short time steps and thus may occasionally be replaced by an equivalent pipe. Orifices are automatically converted to equivalent pipes by the model.
>
> The equivalent pipe substitution used by the model involves the following steps. First the flow equation for the element in question is set equal to the flow equation for an "equivalent pipe". In effect, this says that the head losses in the element and its equivalent pipe are the same. The length of the equivalent pipe is computed using the numerical stability equation.
>
> Then, after making any additional assumptions, which may be required about the equivalent pipe's dimensions, a Manning's 'n' is computed based on the equal head loss requirement. In the case of orifices, this conversion occurs automatically, but in those cases where short pipes or weirs are found to cause instabilities, the user must make the necessary decision and select the appropriate equivalent pipe option.
>
> The desired equivalent pipe length is either no shorter than one quarter or 1/5 of the length of the longest pipe in the system, or large enough to give a delta tc within the range indicated above. Through experience, the user will be able to determine the pipe length changes required to achieve the desired result and an acceptable time-step for the simulation.
>
> By choosing a value of 1.0 for the equivalent pipe option the model will automatically adjust the pipe or channel lengths using an equivalent longer length to achieve a delta tc in balance with the user-selected time-step (delta t). All pipes in which (delta t)/(delta tc) exceeds 1.0 will be adjusted, with the new pipe/channel lengths and roughness printed.
>
> When a value greater than 1.0 is used an equivalent pipe or channel length will be created based on this value (in seconds). For example, specifying a value of 15 will create an equivalent pipe based on a time step of 15 seconds. A before and after analysis of the full flow-system volume is printed by the model for values greater than 1. This enables the user to estimate the effect of the increase in system volume from using equivalent pipes or channels.
>
> **Preprocesses 'n' Only (NEQUAL)**
>
> When this option is set the model modifies the Manning's n value for all pipes that are below the minimum or above a maximum threshold set in adjacent fields in this dialog box.
>
> **Minimum Pipe Length for Modification (NEQUAL)**
>
> Minimum pipe length below which the model will make equivalent pipe assumptions by modifying Manning's n and/or pipe characteristics to optimise stability for particular time steps.

> Maximum pipe length above which the model will make equivalent pipe assumptions by modifying Manning's n and/or pipe characteristics to optimise performance for particular time steps.

> Several methods constitute the genesis of stormwater quality, most notably Buildup and Washoff. In an impervious urban area it is usually assumed that a supply of constituents is built up on the land surface during dry weather preceding a storm. With the storm the material is then washed off into the drainage system.
>
> As an alternative to the use of a buildup-washoff formulation, quality loads may be generated by a rating curve approach. Another quality source is catchbasins. These are treated as a reservoir of constituents in each subcatchment available to be flushed out during a storm. Erosion of "solids" may be simulated directly by the

>
> Universal Soil Loss Equation. SWMM adapts this method for storm events. A final source of constituents is in the precipitation itself. SWMM permits a constant concentration of constituents in precipitation.
>
> Many constituents can appear in either dissolved or solid forms and may be absorbed into other constituents. To treat this situation, any constituent may be computed as a fraction ("potency factor") of another.

>
> Dividing temperature between snow and rain, F \[C\]. Precipitation occurring at air temperatures above this value will be rain, at or below will be snow.
>
> In natural areas, a temperature of 34-35F (1-2C) provides the dividing line between equal probabilities of rain and snow. However, this parameter may need to be somewhat lower in urban areas, due to warmer surface temperatures.
>
> **Snow Gauge Correction Factor (C1 - SCF)**
>
> The snow gauge correction factor accounts for the error in snow gauge measurement.
>
> The factor is usually greater than 1.0 (the gauge tends to underestimate the catch) and increases as a function of wind speed. In practice, the snow gauge correction factor can be used as a calibration factor to account for gains or losses of snow that cannot be determined from the available data. For example, snow losses such as interception and sublimation can be accounted for.
>
> **Antecedent Temperature Weighting Index (C1 - TIPM)**
>
> During non-melt periods the temperature of the snow pack follows the temperature of the air, but with a delay, since temperature changes cannot occur instantaneously. The Antecedent Temperature Weighting Index is an indicator of the surface layer of the snow pack and is used to account for this time delay.
>
> Values of TIPM \<= 0.1 give significant weight to temperatures over the past week or more and would indicate a deep 'surface layer' (thus inhibiting heat transfer). Values of TIPM greater than 0.5 would essentially only give weight to temperatures during the past day. The pack will both warm and cool faster (ie. track the air temperature) with higher values of TIPM. A value of 0.5 has been shown to give reasonable results for natural catchments (Anderson, 1973).

> **Negative Melt/Melt Coefficient Ratio (C1 - RNM)**
>
> Ratio of negative melt coefficient to melt coefficient. "Negative melt coefficient" is used when snow is warming or cooling below the base melt temperature without producing runoff.
>
> Heat transfer within the snow pack is less during non-melt periods due to the presence of liquid water in the pack for the latter case. This parameter multiplies the normal melt coefficients to produce a lower coefficient for use during non-melt periods. The negative melt coefficient is usually \<= 1.0 with a typical value of 0.6 for natural areas. Values for urban areas are likely to be somewhat higher because of the higher density of urban packs. The higher the value, the more rapid the heat gain or loss of the pack in response to air temperature changes.

> **Hemisphere**
>
> The hemisphere item is used to indicate whether the average latitude is in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. **Average Latitude (C1 - ANGLAT)**
>
> Average latitude of watershed, degrees north or south from the equator. This parameter is used to compute daylight hours for the catchment.
>
> **Longitudinal Correction (C1 - DTLONG)**
>
> Longitude correction, standard time minus mean solar time, minutes (of time). This parameter is used to compute the hours of daylight for the catchment. Moderate errors in this parameter have little effect on the results.
>
> Compute DTLONG as follows: Determine standard meridian (SM) for the time zone of the catchment (eg. in the USA EST=75°W, CST=90°W, MST=105°W and PST=120°W). Let theta = average longitude of catchment, and delta = theta - SM. Then DTLONG = 4 x delta. Eg. Minneapolis at theta = 93°W has DTLONG = +12 minutes (of time). Note that one degree of longitude is equal to 4 minutes of time.
>
> **Free Water Holding Capacity**
>
> The free water holding capacity of a snow pack is the volume of water (as a depth) within the pack that can be held as liquid melt prior to releasing runoff. It acts as an intermediate reservoir; the larger its volume, the greater the delay in the appearance of runoff following the conversion of snow to liquid water. Some available information is given in the following table (from Anderson, 1973; Corps of Engineers, 1956).

>
> or with slush layer
>
> Note that the fraction increases as pack density increases, pack depth decreases, slush layer increases, or ground slope decreases. Snowpack depths are in units of water equivalent; one inch of snow water equivalent equals a depth of approximately 11 inches of new snow on the ground surface.

> **Design Undersized Conduits**

608

SECTION 10: JOB CONTROL

This flag controls whether a conduit will be resized automatically by the model if it has insufficient flow carrying capacity. When a surcharge condition is encountered (flow exceeds full flow capacity), the conduit is increased in size in 6-inch \[150 mm\] increments of diameter (for circular pipes, or width for rectangular conduits), until capacity exists to accept the flow. Conduits that are neither circular nor rectangular will be converted to circular if they need to be resized. A message is printed indicating the resizing, and a table of final conduit dimension is printed at the end of the simulation.

The design operation will effectively eliminate surcharging but will also minimize in-system storage within manholes, etc. The net effect is to increase hydrograph peaks at the downstream end of the system. This can create a conflict between controls aimed at curing in-system hydraulic problems, and controls aimed at pollution abatement procedures at the outfall that make use of in-system storage.

Design parameters include: Percent of Full \[conduit\] Depth (%), Minimum Freeboard (ft, m), Minimum Cover (ft, m) and Maximum number of Barrels \[i.e. duplicate conduits\]

**Routing Details**

These parameters deal with accuracy and control of the flow routing algorithms employed. ***Number of Iterations***

This defines the maximum number of iterations allowed in conduit flow routing. This parameter helps to eliminate flow oscillations. Flatter pipe slopes (less than 0.1%) require more iterations in the flow routing simulation to help dampen these oscillations. Four iterations have proven to be sufficient in most cases.

***Convergence Tolerance***

The allowable error for convergence of iterative methods in the routing procedures (dimensionless). Convergence of the flow routing procedure should not normally be a problem. The default value of 0.0001 will provide sufficient accuracy with marginal extra computational effort. Convergence problems may occur when flow enters a dry conduit, which may occur at the beginning of a storm with little or no baseflow. In this case, warning messages describing the problem will be printed if the ‘Print Error Messages’ flag in the ‘Print Control’ dialog is ON. Continuity errors resulting from this condition are usually very small (a fraction of a percent).

If the box is checked, the user specified value is used to detect instabilities – i.e. **if this option is checked, when the depth of flow in any cell in the model reaches the specified level, the simulation will terminate and report instability at the location(s) where this depth occurred. This option is only to be used if you specifically wish to terminate a simulation if a given depth occurs, if this is not desired the Override Instability option should NOT BE USED.**

**2D Cell Checks**

If 2D cells along the 1D/2D interface are lower than the Channel Bed:

Notes: Units are m (metric) and ft (US Customary). Node spillcrest levels can be set equal to the elevation of the DTM by using the generate ground elevations from TIN command on the Tools Menu.

**Elevation Export Files**

If the Include Additional mid/mif Elevation files is checked/selected, then upon solving the simulation the Cell Center elevations (Zpts) will be exported to \*.mid/\*.mif files for inspection external to the software interface. This is one way in which the Zpts can be expected to ensure that the 2D Grid Cells are appropriately representing the topographic surface. These files could also be used to create a DTM representing exactly how the 2D engine “sees” the data.

**Folder Options**

This dialog allows the user to specify where 2D data and results are stored. If unchecked, the results are written to the same folder as the .xp fole.

**Advanced Settings**

The Advanced User Settings allows user the option of incorporating specific additional configuration commands to the 2D engine.

618

SECTION 10: JOB CONTROL

> <img src="./media/image478.jpg" style="width:6.02014in;height:4.02014in" />

The Control File section allows configuration commands to be added to the Tuflow Control file (\*.tcf). In order for commands to be applied to the engine the associated Flag will need to be checked/selected. Note: only one \*.tgc file per 2D domain is specified within the \*.tcf file.

The Geometry Control File section allows specific commands to be added to the Tuflow Geometry Control file (\*.tgc). The top or bottom ordering option allows for the sequential application of commands –commands in the \*.tgc file are applied in sequential order, therefore, it is possible to override previous information with new data to modify the model in selected areas. This is very useful where a base data set exists, over which areas need to be modified to represent other scenarios such as a proposed development. This eliminates or minimizes data duplication.

This option is not typically recommended as the Scenario Manager is a robust tool which can allow numerous model designs or scenarios to be simulated, for both the 1D and 2D portions of the model.

This factor can be estimated using an erodibility nomograph (Wischmeir et al., 1971). However, a preferable and often simpler alternative is to use the soil survey interpretation sheet from the Local Agricultural Research Service and Soil Conservation Service.

To this end, a general equation is provided to formulate the groundwater flow. The variables used in the equation are defined in the parent dialog.

> Because of the general nature of the equation, a variety of functional forms can be approximated. A linear reservoir can be selected by setting the Groundwater Flow Exponent (B1) to 1 and the Channel Water Influence Coefficient (A2) and the Groundwater/Channel Water Coefficient (A3) to 0.
>
> One very important rule to remember, regardless of the functional form chosen, is that the groundwater flow should never be allowed to be negative. Although negative flow may occur in reality (ie. bank recharge), SWMM cannot subtract flow from the channel, since flow routing is not coupled to groundwater flow routing.

It represents the loss or "initial abstraction" caused by such phenomena as surface ponding, surface wetting, interception and evaporation. Depression storage may be treated as a calibration parameter, particularly to adjust runoff volumes. Separate depression stores are required for pervious and impervious areas.
>
> When a subarea impervious% value \> 0 is used the subarea is divided into two components representing the impervious and pervious portions. Horton or Green Ampt losses are **only applied to the pervious portion of the subarea**. In some runoff procedures including the EPA runoff, kinematic wave method, and some unit hydrograph methods currently excluding the time/area method also include additional depression storage loss. Impervious depression storage loss is the only loss applied to the impervious portion.
>
> Separate Horton or Green Ampt losses can be applied to both impervious and pervious portions of a sub-catchment by defining two subareas each with impervious% set to 0 (zero). Then use the pervious parameters within the infiltration dialog to define each impervious and pervious areas respectively.

> Impervious area depression storage, in. \[mm\]. Water stored as depression storage on impervious areas is depleted by evaporation. A relationship for depression storage versus catchment slope has been developed as follows (Kidd, 1978):

> Pervious area depression storage, in. \[mm\]. Water stored as depression storage is subject to both infiltration and evaporation. This parameter is best represented as an interception loss, based on the type of surface vegetation. For grassed urban surfaces, a value of 0.10 in. (2.5 mm) is typical.

Design events can be obtained by considering historical events or generating synthetic events. Synthetic events may be constructed by the following steps:

655

> xpswmm Reference Manual

1.  A storm duration is chosen, either arbitrarily or to coincide with the assumed catchment time of concentration. Note that time of concentration also depends on rainfall intensity and other parameters.

2.  A return period is chosen in order to select the total storm depth for the specified duration from intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves.

3.  A time history, or shape, for the storm is assumed, usually on the basis of historical percentage mass curves.

4.  The continuous hyetograph thus produced is discretised into a histogram for input into the model. Some of the conceptual problems associated with this procedure for constructing synthetic hyetographs are:

> IDF curves themselves may consist of components of several different storms, thus not representing the time history of any storm. IDF curves cannot be used to assign frequencies to storm volumes independent of duration. Antecedent conditions must be chosen arbitrarily.

> Water quality routing through conduits in both the Sanitary and Runoff layers is accomplished by assuming complete mixing within the conduit in the manner of a continuously stirred tank reactor. With this procedure, the concentration of the pollutant in the conduit is assumed to be equal to the outflow concentration. The calculations are based on a mass balance, under the assumption that pollutants are removed at a rate proportional to the concentration in the conduit. An integrated form of the solution to the governing equation is used to avoid inaccuracies due to relatively small conduit volumes.

Scour/deposition relates to the deposition of material during dry-weather flow and subsequent scour during wet-weather flow.

> The Sanitary layer utilises a fixed particle size and specific gravity distribution for each pollutant characterised this way. This distribution is applied to source pollutant loads entering a conduit. The Sanitary layer maintains a time history of the maximum particle size in suspension and the minimum particle size in the bed for each conduit. Mass-weighted values of the particle size distribution of particles in motion are routed downstream for entry into subsequent conduits.
>
> Several assumptions are made in the development of the algorithm. Solids in the sewer system are assumed to behave like ideal non-cohesive sediment. No distinction is made between particle size and specific gravity distributions resulting from different pollutant sources, eg. dry-weather flow and storm water. Only one distribution is used for each pollutant. Shields’ criterion is used to determine the dividing particle size between motion and no motion. Once in motion, no distinction is made between bed and suspended load. Particles in motion (“suspension”) are routed downstream in each conduit by complete mixing, in the same manner as other pollutants.
>
> When a critical diameter is determined for scour, all particles having a diameter smaller than the critical diameter are eroded. Armouring or erosion of the bed layers is not simulated. Scour-deposition is considered only in conduits, it is not simulated in non-conduits, or Storage nodes. The effect of deposited sediment on the bed geometry is not considered. When the hydraulic radius (an important parameter) is calculated to determine the critical diameter for motion, the bed is assumed to have the geometry of the conduit. This may lead to some underestimation of deposited material, mainly at low flows.
>
> For each conduit, the critical diameter is determined as a function of velocity, roughness and specific gravity. At the same time, the maximum diameter of the suspended fraction and the minimum diameter of the settled fraction is maintained. If the critical diameter is less than the maximum of the suspended material, more is settled; similarly, if the critical diameter is greater than the minimum of the settled material, more is suspended.
>
> Continuity of pollutant mass is maintained during scour and deposition. In addition, larger particles can settle upstream in flat conduits and be unavailable for downstream settling. No layering within the sediment is possible; a uniform distribution with sediment depth is assumed.

These estimates are calculated from data describing drainage basin subdivisions (referred to as sub-areas) under which the trunk sewer passes.

These estimates are adjusted during the simulation by factors that depend on the day of the week and hour of the day, to account for temporal variation.

> Firstly, the average daily values of flow and pollutant concentrations are used to calculate the total loads of pollutant for the study area. Infiltration (computed by the model) is then subtracted from the daily average flow. Next, the known process flow contributions (defined locally at nodes) are deducted from the daily totals, yielding further corrected characteristics. Loads are then corrected for personal income variations, degree of commercial use, garbage grinder usage, and population. Average concentrations of all pollutants are then computed. These values are used as the basis for adjusting sub-area concentrations.

> Infiltration is classified into four categories:

- miscellaneous sources causing a base dry weather inflow,

- frozen residual moisture,

- antecedent precipitation, and

- high groundwater.

> Infiltration is defined as:
>
> QINF = DINFIL + RINFIL + SINFIL for low groundwater
>
> QINF = GINFIL, for high groundwater  
> Where:
>
> QINF = total infiltration
>
> DINFIL = dry weather infiltration
>
> RINFIL = wet weather infiltration
>
> SINFIL = melting residual ice and snow infiltration
>
> GINFIL = groundwater infiltration.
>
> The totals for the study area must be entered; the model then apportions these flows to each conduit. The criterion chosen for apportionment is an opportunity factor which represents the relative number and length of openings susceptible to infiltration. Pipe joints constitute the primary avenue for entry of infiltration. The number and length of joints is assumed to be proportional to the relative surface area of each conduit. The fraction of total infiltration is calculated as:
>
> OPINF = Af \* DIST / • (Af \* DIST)

OPINF = fraction of total infiltration to a conduit

Af = cross-sectional area of conduit

DIST = conduit length

> The summation in the denominator is for all conduits.
>
> The apportioned infiltration enters the system at the node immediately upstream of the conduit. This procedure allocates the most infiltration to the largest and longest conduits. It is also possible to enter infiltrations directly at manholes, if local information dictates otherwise.
>
> Note: When GINFIL is greater than 0 (high groundwater condition), DINFIL, RINFIL, and SINFIL (low groundwater condition) are ignored.
>
> **Dry weather infiltration**
>
> The total base infiltration for the study area in dry weather, cfs \[cms\]. If the study area has been gauged, base dry-weather infiltration can be taken from inspection of the flow data. In the absence of flow data, an estimate of the unit infiltration rate (gpm per inch-diameter per mile) must be obtained from local professionals. From data in this form, the following equation can be used:
>
> DINFIL = XLOCAL \* DIAM \* PLEN
>
> where
>
> DINFIL = dry weather infiltration, gpm
>
> DIAM = average sewer diameter, inch
>
> PLEN = pipe length, mile
>
> XLOCAL = unit infiltration rate, gpm/inch-diameter/mile
>
> Values of XLOCAL range from 250 to 600 gpm/in-diam/day and may be even higher for laterals with many stubs. The importance of local data cannot be over-emphasised.

> **Wet Weather Infiltration (Rinfil)**
>
> The rainwater infiltration, in cfs \[cms\]. This parameter depends on antecedent precipitation occurring within the nine day period prior to an estimate. If antecedent rainfall is unavailable or less than about 0.25 in. (6.4 mm), the rainwater contribution to total infiltration is usually small.
>
> For larger antecedent rainfall contributions, regression techniques offer a suitable method for estimating this parameter. Three study areas in which sewer flow data were not affected by melting were shown to satisfy the following linear relationship:
>
> RINFIL = ALF + SUM (ALF\[n\] \* RN\[n\]), for n=0,9

= SWFLOW - DINFIL - SMMDWF

> where
>
> RINFIL = rainwater infiltration, gpm

>

>
> SWFLOW = daily average sewer flow excluding surface runoff, gpm
>
> SMMDWF = otherwise accounted for sewage flow, gpm
>
> DINFIL = dry weather infiltration, gpm

> **Groundwater infiltration**

> That component of total infiltration originating from groundwater, cfs \[cms\]. For locations and times of the year where the groundwater table is above the sewer invert, groundwater infiltration supersedes contribution from all other sources. Groundwater infiltration can be determined from historical sewer flow data, by inspection, or regression analysis. For example, a regression analysis could involve determination of the BETA coefficient in the following formulation:
>
> GINFIL = BETA + BETA1\*GWHD + BETA2\*GWHD^2 + BETA3\*GWHD^0.5

The pump's operating range is limited to the range between the lowest pumping rate and the highest pumping rate regardless of the detected dynamic head.

>
> **Well Volume**

>
> Note that only one conduit may be connected to the node from which this type of pump operates.
>
> Inflows to the off-line pump must be derived from the main sewer system through an orifice, a weir, or a pipe. The influent to the wet-well node must be a free discharge regardless of the diversion structure. The pumping rule curve is based on the volume of water in the storage node.
>
> Wet-well volumes are specified as input data for each pump station: Vl \< V \< Vh, where Vh is the maximum capacity of the wet well. The pumping rates are specified as input data for each station. The pump rate is selected automatically depending on the volume in the wet-well.

>
> The dynamic head difference between the upstream and downstream nodes determines the pumping rate according to a three-point head-discharge relationship for the pump.

**Natural Section Shape**

> <img src="./media/image546.jpg" style="width:5.99653in;height:5.3in" />

In all versions of the software since version 9.0 the natural section profile data has been stored in a global database. This allows profiles of, for example, channel improvements or roadway cross-sections to be re-used in multiple links.

The data is defined by HEC-2 type natural surface cross-section coordinate pairs *(C4 or GR**)***. Elevations are used only to determine the shape of the cross-section. Invert elevations are defined in the node data dialog box and also by the Upstream and Downstream Elevations shown in the appropriate link dialog.

The low point in the cross-section is the lowest point between the left and right Main Channel Stations. The high point is the highest point of all the cross-section coordinates. If the left-most or right-most elevations are less than this (maximum) value, vertical sides are projected up to the high point. Total cross-section depth is computed as the difference between the high point of the cross-section and low point of the cross-section (as described above).

The profile is defined in terms of station **(x)** and stage **(elevation).

> A value of A = 0 gives the familiar Weibull plotting position, often used in hydrology, but criticised by Cunnane (1978) who suggested a value of A = 0.4 as a good compromise for the customary situation in which the underlying frequency distribution of the parameter is unknown.
>
> **Inter-event Time**
>
> Minimum number of zero-rainfall hours to constitute separate rainfall events, ie. this number of hours with zero rainfall is required between two rainfall values for the values to be treated as separate storms. Dry periods of duration less than this value may exist within an event, preceded and followed by wet periods. If a value of 1 is chosen, every contiguous rainfall sequence will be viewed as a separate event.
>
> Values of 3 to 30 hours are often used to separate rainfall events. Another approach uses the coefficient of variation (CV) of inter-event time (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean). The inter-event time giving a CV around 1.0 is usually chosen. This method assumes inter-event times have an exponential distribution, so that two trial values are used and corresponding CV values determined through two runs of the RAIN utility; a plot will give a good estimate of the minimum inter-event time for which CV is around 1.0.

The data is then separated into events. There is an internal limit to the number of events that can be analysed per location. After the entire simulation period has been examined, a table of the sequential series of events is printed, if requested. Tables of magnitude, return period, and frequency are then printed followed by graphs of magnitude versus return period or frequency. Finally, the mean, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and coefficient of skewness of the event data are calculated and printed.

>
> **Minimum Inter-event Time**
>
> Minimum number of dry hours between separate events. Minimum period of zero values (or values less than the base value) before any new values will be considered part of a separate event.
>
> If a value of zero is chosen for this value, every wet time step will be viewed as a separate event. Values less than the base value will be considered as part of an inter-event period.
>
> Values of 3 to 30 hours are often used to separate rainfall events. Another approach uses the coefficient of variation (CV) of inter-event time (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean). The inter-event time giving a CV around 1.0 is usually chosen. This method assumes inter-event times have an exponential distribution, so that two trial values are used and corresponding CV values determined through two runs of the Statistics utility; a plot will give a good estimate of the minimum inter-event time for which CV is around 1.0. Depending upon the site, this definition applied to the runoff time series can yield large values in the order of 100 hours.
>
> **Cutoff Value Separating Events**
>
> Events are separated using a base or cutoff value. Values greater than this threshold are part of the event; conversely values less than or equal to this threshold are part of the inter-event period. The value may be interpreted as a flow, volume or intensity, depending on the type of analysis being done.

The general philosophy is to trap any data problems at the highest possible level - at the point the data is created by the users.

- Number of links connected at a node not greater than 7.

- Double links not allowed - a multi-link must be used.

> **Data Type Checking**
>
> Data entered via text items is checked against the data type expected for that item. If a number is expected then the text string entered is interpreted to see it follows the rules for numerical strings. For example, if an integer (whole number) is expected, then invalid characters such as non-digits, decimal points etc, are trapped and the data is not accepted.

> The syntax for numerical strings follows the usual rules. Larger-magnitude numbers can be entered via exponential notation.
>
> XP indicates floating-point numerical items by adding a decimal point if you haven't already done so.
>
> **Data Range Checking**
>
> As data is entered it is filtered on two levels:

- Data is checked to ensure it is within a "reasonable" range

> eg. Mannings 'n' has a reasonable range of 0.005 to 0.5. If data outside the reasonable range is entered a warning message is issued, with the reasonable range indicated and the data is accepted.

- Data is checked to ensure it is within an absolute limit

> eg. Mannings 'n' cannot be less than zero. If data is outside the absolute range an error message is issued, with the valid range indicated, and the data not accepted. Execution cannot continue unless a valid value is entered or "Cancel" is selected.
>
> **Relational Consistency Checking**
>
> After all the data has been entered and the user attempts to solve the networks the inter-relationship of all data is checked for consistency, again at two levels:

- Warning messages are generated for data outside reasonable constraints, or missing data for which default parameters have been provided, but the network can still be solved, and

- Error messages are generated for data outside the absolute range, or data that is illegal in its context with other parameters, and the network can not be solved until these errors are corrected.

> Urban runoff quantity and quality constitute problems of both a historical and current nature. Cities have long assumed the responsibility of control of Stormwater flooding and treatment of point sources (e.g., municipal sewage) of wastewater. Within the past two decades, the severe pollution potential of urban non-point sources, principally combined sewer overflows and Stormwater discharges, has been recognized, both through field observation and federal legislation. The advent of modern, high speed computers has led to the development of new, complex, sophisticated tools for analysis of both quantity and non-point pollution problems. The EPA Storm Water Management Model, SWMM, developed in 1969-71, was one of the first of such models, it has been continually maintained and updated, and is perhaps the best known and most widely used of the available urban runoff quantity/quality models.
>
> Many of the changes that have occurred in SWMM during the past 15 years have been poorly documented and were not readily visible to users. This volume includes documentation of major changes to the model since its original development. Theory that underlies unchanged parts of the model may still be reviewed in the original documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, 1971b, 1971c, 1971d) plus intermediate reports (Huber et al., 1975; Heaney et al., 1975). This volume supersedes Version 4 documentation (Huber et al., 1988) and includes essentially all material from that manual plus enhancements to the model made by WP Software.

> **Objectives**
>
> Models are generally used for studies of quantity and quality problems associated with urban runoff in which four broad objectives may be identified: screening, planning, design and operation. Each objective typically produces models with somewhat different characteristics with the different models overlapping to some degree.
>
> **Screening Models**
>
> Screening models are preliminary, "first-cut" ("Level I"), desktop procedures that require no computer. They are intended to provide a first estimate of the magnitude of urban runoff quantity and quality problems, prior to an investment of time and resources into more complex computer based models. Examples of screening models include SWMM Level I procedures (Heaney et al., 1976; Heaney and Nix, 1977) and others: Howard (1976), Hydroscience (1976, 1979), Chan and Bras (1979).
>
> 757
>
> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> **Planning Models**
>
> Planning models are used for an overall assessment of the urban runoff problem as well as estimates of the effectiveness and costs of abatement procedures. They may also be used for "first-cut" analyses of the rainfall-runoff process and illustrate trade-offs among various control options. They are typified by relatively large time steps (hours) and long simulation times (months and years), i.e., continuous simulation. Data requirements are kept to a minimum and their mathematical complexity is low.
>
> SWMM has had this capability since 1976, following the earliest work of the Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966) and the latter widely-used Corps of Engineers STORM model (Roesner et al., 1974; HEC, 1977a).
>
> A planning model may also be run to identify hydrologic events that may be of special interest for design or other purposes. These storm events may then be analyzed in detail using a more sophisticated design model (Huber et al., 1986). SWMM can be used in both the planning and design mode. Planning or long-term models may also be used to generate initial conditions (i.e., antecedent conditions) for input to design models. They may occasionally be coupled to continuous receiving water models as well; for example, SWMM and STORM may be used as input to Medina’s (1979) Level III Receiving Water Model.
>
> **Design Models**
>
> Design models are oriented toward the detailed simulation of a single storm event. They provide a omplete description of flow and pollutant routing from the point of rainfall through the entire urban runoff system and often into the receiving waters as well. Such models may be used for predictions of flows and concentrations anywhere in the rainfall/runoff system and can illustrate the detailed and exact manner in which abatement procedures or design options affect them. As such, these models are a highly useful tool for determining least-cost abatement procedures for both quantity and quality problems in urban areas. Design models are generally used for simulation of a single storm event and are typified by short time steps (minutes) and short simulation times (hours). Data requirements may be moderate to very extensive depending upon the particular model employed.
>
> In its original form (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, 1971b, 1971c, 1971d), SWMM was strictly a design model. However, as described above, it may now be used in both a planning and design mode. In addition, it has acquired additional design potential through inclusion of the Extended Transport Model, Extran, developed by Camp, Dresser and McKee (formerly Water Resources Engineers). Extran is probably the most sophisticated program available for detailed hydraulic analysis of sewer systems (Shubinski and Roesner, 1973; Roesner et al., 1981; Roesner et al., 1987).
>
> **Operational Models**
>
> Operational models are used to produce actual control decisions during a storm event. Rainfall is entered from telemetered stations and the model is used to predict system responses a short time into the future. Various control options may then be employed, e.g., in-system storage, diversions, regulator settings.
>
> These models are frequently developed from sophisticated design models and applied to a particular system; Schilling (1985) provides a review. Examples are operational models designed for Minneapolis-St. Paul (Bowers et al., 1968) and Seattle (Leiser, 1974).
>
> **Other Models**
>
> SWMM is by no stretch of the imagination the only urban runoff model available, or necessarily the preferred one under many circumstances. Many other urban runoff models have been described in the literature and are too numerous to list here. However, good comparative reviews are available, e.g., Brandstetter (1977), Chu and Bowers (1977), Huber and Heaney (1980, 1982), Kibler (1982), Kohlhaas (1982), EPA(1983a), Whipple et al. (1983) and Hall (1984). EPA’s water quality models are reviewed by Barnwell (1984). A general review of methods available for urban quality modelling and six operational urban quality models is provided by Huber (1985, 1986). Many more models are available for purely hydrologic and hydraulic analysis.
>
> **Origin and Historical Developments**
>
> Under the sponsorship of the Environmental Protection Agency, a consortium of contractors — Metcalf and Eddy, Incorporated, the University of Florida, and Water Resources Engineers, Incorporated — developed, in 1969-71, the Storm Water Management Model, SWMM, capable of representing urban stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflow phenomena. Both quantity and quality problems and control options may be investigated with the model, with associated cost estimates available for storage and/or treatment controls. Effectiveness can be evaluated by inspection of hydrographs, pollutographs, pollutant loads, and modelled changes in receiving water quality.
>
> The original project report is divided into four volumes. Volume I, the "Final Report" (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a), contains the background, justifications, judgments, and assumptions used in the model development. It further
>
> 758
>
> SECTION 15: THEORY
>
> includes descriptions of unsuccessful modelling techniques that were attempted and recommendations for forms of user teams to implement systems analysis techniques most effectively. Although many modifications and improvements have since been added to SWMM, the material in Volume I still accurately describes much of the theory behind updated versions. Documentation of some of the procedures included in the 1975 Version II (Huber et al., 1975) release of SWMM is also provided by Heaney et al. (1975).
>
> Volume II, "Verification and Testing," (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971b), describes the methods and results of the application of the original model to four urban catchments.
>
> Volume III, the "User’s Manual" (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971c) contains program descriptions, flow charts, instructions on data preparation and program usage, and test examples. This was updated in 1975 by the Version II User’s Manual (Huber et al., 1971) and in 1981 by the Version 3 User’s Manuals (Huber et al., 1981; Roesner et al., 1981).

> Volume IV, "Program Listing" (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971d), lists the entire original program and Job Control Language (JCL) as used in the demonstration runs. Since many routines in the updated version are similar or identical to the original, it is still a useful reference, but on the whole should be disregarded since the present coding is, in most cases, completely different.
>
> An extensive bilbiography of SWMM usage is available (Huber et al., 1985) and is highly recommended for new users. Case studies mentioned in the bibliography are especially useful.
>
> EXTRAN the program had its origin in the early 1960’s as a model of San Francisco Bay \[Shubinski, 1965\]. Its early mode was a link-node receiving water model. In the early development of EXTRAN, a constant velocity approach was used, but this was later found to produce highly unstable solutions. Additional capability was added in the early 1970’s to simulate the upland areas contributing stormwater runoff to San Francisco Bay.
>
> This new model called EXTRAN was developed for the City of San Francisco in 1973 (Shubinski and Roesner, 1973; Kibler et al., 1975). At that time it was called the San Francisco Model and (more properly) the WRE Transport Model. Water Resources Engineers became wholly integrated into Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc. in 1980. In 1974, EPA acquired this model and incorporated it into the SWMM package, calling it the Extended Transport Model - EXTRAN - to distinguish it from the Transport Block developed by the University of Florida as part of the original SWMM package.
>
> Another big increase in the model capabilities occurred in the middle 1980’s when CDM undertook the simulation of Virginia Beach, Virginia, U.S.A., an area with multiple tidal bays and flat areas. The ability to model natural channels with arbitrary cross sections, variable storage areas (i.e., lakes and detention ponds) and multiple tidal boundaries was added to the EXTRAN Model by CDM in the middle 1980’s.
>
> Since the release of EXTRAN 2, the model has been refined, particularly in the way the flow routing is performed under surcharge conditions. EXTRAN 2 used surge tanks to model surcharged flow. EXTRAN 3 used an iterative solution to model surcharged flow based on a point junction formulation. EXTRAN 4 added a "Preissmann" slot to model surcharged flow as open channel flow. Most importantly in the 1980’s, especially after the release of EXTRAN 4 in 1988, much experience has been gained in the use and misuse of the model by practicing engineers.

> values. Since study objectives may be directed toward both complete temporal and spatial detail as well as to gross effects (such as total pounds of pollutant discharged in a given storm), it is essential to have both time series output, i.e., hydrographs and "pollutographs" (concentrations versus time) and daily, monthly, annual and total simulation summaries (for continuous simulation) available for review.
>
> In simplest terms the program is constructed in the form of "blocks" as follows:

1)  **The input sources:** The Runoff Block generates surface and subsurface runoff based on arbitrary rainfall (and/or snowmelt) hyetographs, antecedent conditions, land use, and topography. Dry-weather flow and infiltration into the sewer system may be optionally generated using the Transport Block.

2)  **The central cores:** The Runoff, Transport and Extended Transport (Extran) Blocks route flows and pollutants through the sewer or drainage system (Pollutant routing is not currently available in the Extran Block). Very sophisticated hydraulic routing may be performed with Extran.

3)  **The correctional devices:** The Storage/Treatment Block characterizes the effects of control devices upon flow and quality. Elementary cost computations are also made.

4)  **The effect (receiving waters):** SWMM does not include a receiving water model. The Receiving Water Block (Receiv) is no longer included within the SWMM framework. However, a linkage is provided for the EPA WASP and DYNHYD models (Ambrose et al., 1986).

> Quality constituents for simulation may be arbitrarily chosen for any of the blocks. The Extran Block is the only block that does not simulate water quality.
>
> The Transport, Extran and Storage/Treatment Blocks may all use input and provide output to any block, including themselves. The Runoff Block uses input from no other computational block but may receive input from Rain and Temp Blocks for meteorological input.
>
> **Graph Block**
>
> Plots of hydrographs, pollutographs and other time series output may be obtained using the Graph Block. Measured as well as predicted time series may be plotted. Alternatively, the user may access the time series file (known in this manual as the "interface file") for plots by other graphics software.
>
> **Rain Block**
>
> Continuous simulation relies upon precipitation input using long-term data available on magnetic tapes from the National Weather Service (NWS) National Climatic Data Center in the United States or Atmospheric Environment Service in Canada. The Rain Block processes NWS tapes for input into the Runoff Block. A synoptic statistical analysis may also be performed on rainfall data, similarly to the EPA SYNOP program (Hydroscience 1976, 1979).
>
> **Temp Block**
>
> In a similar manner, the Temp Block processes NWS long-term temperature data for input into the Runoff Block for snowmelt calculations.
>
> **Statistics Block**
>
> Output from continuous simulation can be enormous if results for every time step are printed. Even the monthly and annual summaries contain more information than may easily be assimilated. The Statistics Block has the capability to review the time step output from a continuous (or single event) simulation, separate output into discrete storm events, rank the events according to almost any desired criterion (e.g., peak or average runoff rate, pollutant load, etc.), assign empirical frequencies and return periods to runoff and pollutant parameters, tabulate and graph the results, and calculate statistical moments. Output from this block can thus be used to identify key events for further study and for many other screening and analytical purposes.
>
> This manual provides a description of program operation, documentation of most algorithms used within the block (or reference to earlier documentation), and instructions on data preparation with input requirements for each block.
>
> **Detailed SWMM Summary**
>
> A concise description of most features of SWMM is given in Table 1-1, adapted from similar tables prepared by Huber and Heaney (1980, 1982). An indication of almost all modelling techniques is included in the table.

> **Input Data Requirements**
>
> As will be seen from a review of following sections, the data requirements for SWMM may be extensive. Collection of the data from various municipal and other offices within a city is possible to accomplish within a few days. However, reduction of the data for input to the model is time consuming and may take up to three man-weeks for a large area (e.g., greater than 2000 acres). On an optimistic note, however, most of the data reduction is straight forward (e.g., tabulation of slopes, lengths, diameters, etc., of the sewer system).
>
> SWMM is flexible enough to allow different modelling approaches to the same area and a specific, individual modelling decision upstream in the catchment will have little effect on the predicted results at the outfall. Furthermore, a lumped approach may often be used for preliminary modelling in which catchment properties are aggregated and only minimal data is needed. The user should realise that only portions of the overall model (e.g., one block) need be run at any one time.
>
> **Verification and Calibration**
>
> Calibration is the adjustment of model parameters using one set of data. Verification is the testing of this parameter selection by using an independent data set. Although the simulation of many of the urban runoff processes found in SWMM is physically based, the concept fails in practice because the input data and the numerical methods are not accurate enough for many real applications. Furthermore, many computational procedures within the model are based upon limited data themselves and highly empirical, especially surface quality predictions. As a result, it is <u>essential that local verification/calibration data be available at specific application sites to lend credibility to the predictions of any urban runoff model</u>.
>
> Calibration and verification data are usually in the form of measured flows and concentrations at outfalls or combined sewer overflow locations. However, it is important to note that detailed short-time-increment pollutographs during a storm are seldom needed for analysis of recieving water quality. Hence, total storm event loads or event mean concentrations are usually sufficient for quality calibration and verification (Note that quality concentrations without accompanying flows are of little value). SWMM has sufficient parameters that may be "adjusted," particularly in the Runoff Block, such that calibrating the model against measured data is usually readily accomplished.
>
> Quantity (hydrograph) predictions are often "within the ball park" on the first try, given decent rainfall, area and imperviousness data. However, initial quality estimates may be off by orders of magnitude (Huber, 1985). Hence, quality predictions are not credible without adequate site-specific data for <u>calibration and verification. At best, relative effects of pollution abatement alternatives may be studied if such data is not available</u>.
>
> **Metrification**
>
> Use of metric units for input and output of data and results is an option in all blocks as an alternative to U.S. customary units. In the Runoff and Transport Blocks, metric units are used strictly for I/O; all internal quantity calculations are still performed in units of feet and seconds (Feet-second units also apply to program generated error messages printed during the simulation). However, when used, the Storage/Treatment and Extran Blocks use metric units for internal calculations also. Most quality calculations use conventional concentration units (e.g., mg/l) and loads may be given in both pounds and kilograms, depending on the particular subroutine, although pounds will not be used if metric I/O is specified.
>
> No attempt has been made to conform to SI standards or even customary metric units for some parameters. For instance, because of output format complications, metric pipe diameters are requested and printed in meters instead of the more usual millimeters. However, all units are clearly stated for both input and output. It should be a simple task to convert to other metric alternatives.
>
> **Changes from SWMM V. 3 to SWMM V. 4**
>
> Many enhancements to SWMM were accomplished since SWMM 3.0 was released in 1981 (Roesner et al., 1981) and the release of EXTRAN 4 in 1989. These include:

1)  Errors have been corrected for all blocks as best they are known and convergence problems improved.

2)  "Hot Start" capability (restart from end of previous run).

3)  Minor improvements to surcharge and flow routing routines.

4)  Automatic adjustment of short pipe lengths.

0)  SWMM output may be linked to the DYNHYD4 (water quantity) and WASP4 (water quality) programs for receiving water quality simulation (Ambrose et al., 1986). Runoff, Transport, Storage/Treatment, and Extran interface files can be read by both DYNHYD4 and WASP4. DYNHYD reads only the flows from the interface file. WASP4 reads water quality loading rates from Runoff, Transport, and Storage/Treatment. A model of an estuary therefore can include Runoff to generate surface pollutant loadings, Transport or Extran for detailed simulation of surface routing network, DYNHYD4 for simulating a link-node estuary model, and WASP4 for simulating the water quality of the estuary under the stress of the Runoff or Transport pollutant loadings.

1)  The microcomputer version permits greater manipulation of interface files and other scratch and I/O files. The program may be used to convert any interface file to formatted (ASCII/text) files capable of being read by programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 or other software. All interface files can be permanently saved and retrieved. Users can input their own interface files.

2)  A subsurface routing package (quantity only) has been added to the Runoff Block. A separate accounting is made for the unsaturated and saturated zones, and the water table elevation can fluctuate. Baseflow to Runoff channel/pipes may be generated from the saturated zone.

3)  The Runoff Block (through access to the Rain Block) will read the new National Weather Service format for precipitation tapes. In general, continuous simulation is easier, with several options for input of precipitation data and other time series. User-defined input time series may also be used. Continuous simulation is capable of using up to 10 rain gauges.

> Instead of processing continuous meteorological data in the Runoff Block, two new blocks have been added; Rain and Temp. These provide additional statistical analysis similar to the SYNOP program of Hydroscience (1976, 1979). It is also possible to process rainfall data with the SWMM Statistics Block.

4)  Numerical methods have been improved in the Runoff Block. A variation of the extrapolation method (Press et al., 1986) is used to couple the nonlinear reservoir equations, evaporation, infiltration, and groundwater flow. There is no longer any distinction between single event and continuous. Runoff uses a wet, dry and intermediate (wet/dry) time step defined by the user.

5)  This version of SWMM tries to use more Fortran primitives. There is one subroutine to read interface files, one subroutine to write interface files, one clock subroutine, one file opening routine etc. for all blocks. The common functions of all blocks are exactly the same.

6)  This version can be made more modular than the EPA Version 3 for the microcomputer. It is possible to run files containing only the blocks of interest, saving the interface file for use by the next block. This permits file compression for ease of distribution and much faster execution times.

7)  The Graph Block is no longer limited to 200 data points. An unlimited number of points for both measured and predicted graphs can be plotted. Graph plots loadographs (mass/time versus time) and pollutographs (concentration versus time).

8)  The user has more control over printout in this version of SWMM. Most printout can be bypassed at the user’s discretion. Error messages are summarized at the end of a run instead of being printed every time step.

9)  Microcomputer users will see the current time or time step printed on the screen during the simulation as well as other program messages.

10) Input and simulation of channels with irregular cross-sections, using either selected HEC-2 data lines or user generated input lines (in HEC-2 format). EXTRAN input lines (or data groups) have identifiers in columns 1 and 2, and all input is free format.

11) Power function cross sections for conduits (e.g., parabolic and elliptic channels).

12) Variable-sized storage junctions, input as stage-area data.

> 762
>
> SECTION 15: THEORY

13) Pump operating curves, or dynamic head pumps.

14) Use of different boundary conditions at each outfall.

15) Interpolated stage time series boundary condition at an outfall, or h(t) boundary conditions.

16) Variable orifice discharge coefficients and orifice areas over time.

17) Flap gates are simulated in interior conduits.

18) "Hot start" input and output using saved files. This permits a restart of SWMM from the "middle" of a previous run.

19) Optional metric or American standard units. The program was converted to optional metric units (used both for input/output and internal calculations when employed).

20) Calculation errors in rectangular conduits have been fixed.

21) Alphanumeric conduit and junction names (instead of pure numbers) became optional in SWMM.

22) Output summaries and input error checking were substantially improved over version 3.0. Input and output have been enhanced to reflect a likely microcomputer environment.

23) Inclusion of data group identifiers on data input lines and free format input.

24) Surcharged weirs are included in the surcharge algorithm.

25) Two additional flow solutions were included in the model.

> The goal of these modifications was the enhancement of the model capabilities and addressing the concerns of the model users. For example, EXTRAN problems described in the literature included the sole use of American units (Metric added), lag in updating (still a problem), program "bugs" (fixed), the program is too large to understand, and the program exceeds available computer memory (FORTRAN code changed to FORTRAN 77 and the advent of microcomputers) \[Sjoberg, 1981\].
>
> **Changes from SWMM Version 4 to XP-SWMM**
>
> Many enhancements to SWMM have been accomplished since SWMM 4.0 was released in 1989 (Huber et al., 1989, Roesner et al., 1989). The majority of these changes have been accomplished in 1992/1993 by WP Software Pty Ltd. These include:

1)  Several hundred bug fixes to the original SWMM code.

2)  Vertically differentiated roughness in closed and open channels. Each conduit has two regions of roughness; a higher roughness when the depth is less than a predefined depth and normal roughness from the predefined depth to the crown of the conduit.

3)  Shock losses from the transition from subcritical to supercritical flow.

4)  The approach velocity in the side flow weir equations is now accounted for in the program.

> xpswmm Reference Manual

5)  Two EXTRAN simulations can be linked via a stage boundary condition. The time history of stage and flow is connected to the stage and flow history of a previous EXTRAN simulation. EXTRAN now has the ability to interface with EXTRAN.

6)  The transition between open channel flow to pressure flow at weirs has been modified to enhance the stability of the solution.

7)  A demand curve for outfalls, or a Q(t) boundary condition.

8)  Natural channels have automatically defined "floodplains" to account for flows above the maximum channel depth.

9)  Ponded flood water at EXTRAN nodes may optionally be returned to the main system.

10) The connection between closed conduits and open conduits has enhanced stability because of adjustments to junction ground elevations.

11) Greatly enhanced stability in the EXTRAN solution of conduit flows and junction depths.

12) Expansion/contraction losses due to changes in cross sectional area are simulated in conduits.

13) Entrance/exit losses at junctions are simulated in conduits.

14) The depth at an outfall is calculated one of three ways:

- Outfall depth is fixed at the normal depth. This applies especially to natural channels.

- Outfall depth is fixed at the critical depth.

- Outfall depth is the minimum of the normal depth or the critical depth based on the conduit flow.

15) Rating curve boundary conditions for outfall, or a Q(h) boundary condition.

16) Irregular shaped closed conduits.

17) EXTRAN generates a better error analysis and continuity check.

18) Water quality in EXTRAN has begun to be implemented.

19) User defined weir exponents.

20) Transition to equivalent conduits when a weir surcharge was modified for increased stability.

21) User defined weir lengths as a function of depth.

22) User defined rating curves for weir flows.

23) One solution was implemented as the solution in XP-SWMM. It is an amalgam of the previous solutions in EXTRAN 4. The multiplicity of solutions affected program maintenance, and the surcharge iterations used for the first two solutions were the biggest cause of slow execution times in EXTRAN. The existing Version 4 solutions have been retained to provide compatibility with existing calibrated models.

24) The number of pollutants has been increased to 20 for all modules.  
    > 764

> SECTION 15: THEORY

25) All modules can route all pollutants.

26) Number of landuses has been increased to 10 for all modules.

27) The Storage/Treatment module has been integrated into Transport allowing multiple STP's and BMP's within the one network.

28) STP's and BMP's are no longer constrained to the outlet of the system.

29) Utilities (Rainfall, Temperature, Wind, Statistics, etc.) are incorporated within the overall interface.

30) The number of hydraulic elements has been increased to 26 for all modules.

31) Weirs, Pumps and Orifices are consistent across all modules.

32) Infiltration method and parameters are now catchment dependent.

33) Rainfall Gauges may start at different times and include an optional multiplier.

34) Pollutant characteristics are local.

35) Flow divides now have explicitly defined flow paths.

36) Process (point-source) and constant flow are allowed for each pollutant.

37) Sophisticated user-defined equations are available for pollutant removal.

38) Time units are more flexible.

39) All modules can route flows through all conduit types.

40) The SCS method of hydrograph generation is now provided.

41) An EMC (Event Mean Concentration) method is now available for pollutant generation.

> **Program Operation Requirements**
>
> SWMM was originally programmed for the UNIVAC 1108 in FORTRAN IV. Later versions of the FORTRAN code were compatible with the IBM FORTRAN LEVEL G compiler and the extended compiler used on CDC 6600 series equipment. The model was subsequently installed on IBM, CDC, VAX, DEC 20, and several other computers. Version 4 refinements to the model were done on a Zenith Z-248 AT-compatible microcomputer in FORTRAN-77 using Ryan-McFarland Professional Fortran. Later versions were VAX and Lahey compatible. XP-SWMM is written in Microsoft-FORTRAN and Microsoft C using the Rational Systems DOS/16M Extended Memory Manager and is most suited to 386 and 486 micro-computers with extended memory.
>
> Execution times for SWMM are roughly proportional to the number of system conduits and the number of time-steps in the simulation period. For example, the first EXTRAN example in this document takes 35 seconds on a 486/33 Mhz microcomputer, 25 seconds on a 486/50 Mhz microcomputer, and 300 seconds on a 286/12 Mhz microcomputer. An additional speedup is available through the use of a disk and memory caching program to speed up the I/O of reading and writing the data, interface and output files.

> **When Should SWMM be Used?**
>
> SWMM is a large, relatively sophisticated hydrologic, hydraulic and water quality simulation program. XP-SWMM combines the sophistication of SWMM modeling with the ease of use of simple standard techniques (e.g., units hydrographs, linear reservoirs) described in hydrology texts and suitable for programmable hand-held calculators (e.g., Croley, 1977) or microcomputers (e.g., Golding, 1981). Many other smaller Fortran programs are available for urban hydrologic simulation and may be entirely suitable for a given problem. HSPF (Johanson et al., 1980) is one alternative for catchments that are primarily non-urban or that require more sophisticated simulation of pollutant interaction.
>
> SWMM is certainly powerful both in terms of its size and capabilities. Who, then, should use SWMM and for what purposes? Some criteria for usage are given below:

1)  The engineer should be knowledgeable in modelling techniques such as; non-linear reservoirs, kinematic waves, St. Venant equations, buildup-washoff equations. An appreciation for how physical processes may be simulated in a Fortran program is a necessity. As a corollary, the engineer is assumed to be familiar with the problem to be solved and with customary techniques for handling it. A clear problem definition is a prerequisite to any solution methodology.

2)  By virtue of the problem size (e.g., sewer system with hundreds of pipes) or complexity (e.g., hydraulic controls, backwater) a simpler technique or model will not work. It may be borne in mind, however, that if calibration/verification data is available, SWMM may also be used as a very simple "black box" model with minimal input data.

3)  Quality is to be simulated. Although there are other models that also simulate quality, SWMM is perhaps the most flexible of any. Of course, SWMM is often applied just to quantity problems.

> A large body of literature on theory and case studies is available for SWMM. Since the model was originally introduced in 1971, a wealth of such information is available, including citation in hydrology texts (e.g., Viessman et al., 1977; Wanielista, 1978; Kibler, 1982). A bibliography of SWMM-related literature is available (Huber et al., 1985).
>
> While any number of examples could be presented for when SWMM should not be used, attention is drawn to just one: when the user is already competent with an adequate alternative technique or model. It is far more important for the engineer/user to understand the methodology being utilized than it is for a model such as SWMM to be employed on the premise of a more sophisticated technique. XP-SWMM, of course, has the advantage that training in the model intricacies can be reduced by an order of magnitude compared with typical text-oriented programs, enabling a user to gain proficiency at a prodigious rate. In the final analysis, the engineer/analyst is responsible for the decisions made using any technique of analysis; the technique or model is only a tool that must be clearly understood by those using it.
>
> **Modelling Caveats**
>
> The preceding section may be summarized by a few caveats for modelling in general and use of SWMM in particular.

1)  Have a known project and modeling objective at the outset of work. Do not let the model capabilities or lack of them dictate the objective.

2)  Use experienced personnel. A knowledge of engineering fundamentals is essential to proper model use and interpretation.

3)  Use the simplest model suitable for the job. Although SWMM can be run in a very simple (e.g., minimal data) manner, there may be alternative models that require less initial effort to install. Sometimes a conclusion will be apparent simply from a review of data and prior studies, with no modelling necessary.

4)  Start simple when learning. Obtain model familiarity by simulating very simple configurations for which the result is known, e.g., runoff from a steady rainfall onto an impervious surface.

5)  Models are poor substitutes for data collection. Do not use the model to generate "real" data.

766

> SECTION 15: THEORY

5)  Examine the results critically. Is continuity preserved? Are predictions physically realistic? If not, review parameter estimates and model assumptions. Perhaps the model cannot simulate a particular physical process of interest.

6)  Use one set of data for calibration and an independent set for verification of parameter choices.

7)  Absolute magnitudes of quality predictions by SWMM or any other model are not to be trusted without calibration and verification data. At best, relative comparisons can be made between runs with differing conditions. Urban runoff quality processes involve too many unknown physical, chemical and biological factors to be simulated accurately.

> **15.1 Extran Theory**
>
> **EXTRAN Overview**
>
> EXTRAN is a hydraulic flow routing model for both open channel and closed conduits in dendritic and looped networks. EXTRAN receives hydrograph input at specific nodal locations by interface file from an upstream block (e.g., the Runoff Block) and/or by direct user input. The model performs dynamic routing of stormwater and sanitary flows throughout the major storm drainage system to the outfall points of the receiving water system.
>
> Since the flow in sewers is usually non-uniform, turbulent, and subject to backwater and surcharge, a model is required that simulates all of the terms in the one dimensional dynamic flow equation. The EXTRAN Model will simulate branched or looped networks, backwater due to tidal or non-tidal conditions, free-surface flow, pressure or surcharge flow, flow reversals, flow transfer by weirs, orifices and pumping facilities, and pond or lake storage. Types of channels that can be simulated include circular, rectangular, horseshoe, eggshape, baskethandle pipes, trapezoidal, parabolic, natural (irregular) channels, circular and rectangular orifices, and arbitrary closed conduit shapes. Simulation output takes the form of water surface elevations and discharge at selected network locations.

>
> A conceptual overview of EXTRAN is shown in Figure 1-1. As shown there, the specific function of EXTRAN is to route inlet hydrographs through the network of pipes, junctions, and flow diversion structures of the main storm water system to the treatment plant interceptors and receiving water outfalls.
>
> Please note that the boundary between the Runoff (or TRANSPORT) and EXTRAN Blocks is dependent on the objectives of the simulation. EXTRAN must be used whenever it is important to represent severe backwater conditions and special flow devices such as weirs, orifices, pumps, storage basins, and tide gates. Normally, these conditions occur in the lower reaches of the drainage system when pipe diameters exceed roughly 20 inches (500 mm). The Runoff Block, on the other hand, is well suited for the simulation of overland and small pipe flow in the upper regions of the system where the nonlinear reservoir assumptions of uniform flow hold.
>
> EXTRAN simulates the following elements: pipes, manholes (pipe junctions), weirs, orifices, pumps, storage basins, and outfall structures. These elements and their associated properties are summarized in Tables 14-1 and 14-2. Output from EXTRAN takes the form of:

1)  Discharge hydrographs and velocities in selected conduits in printed and plotted form, and

2)  Flow depths and water surface elevations at selected junctions in printed and plotted form. Hydrographs may be supplied to a subsequent block on the output interface file.

> Storm sewers are usually designed to be dendritic or trellislike but over time, as more connections are built and the population grows larger, the sewer system may become a looped system. From a hydrodynamic viewpoint the flow in a storm sewer system is one of the most complicated and difficult problems \[Pansic and Yen, 1981\].

767

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> EXTRAN is based on the St. Venant equations for gradually varied one dimensional flow and handles dendritic and looped systems with backwater. However, some flow situations such as roll waves, bores, surges, supercritical flow and hydraulic jumps violate the assumption of gradually varied flow. EXTRAN allows the simulation of these exceptional flow situations by implementing the following procedures when they occur in the course of the simulation:

1)  The propensity for roll waves is tested by calculating the conduit Vedernikov number (French, 1986). Conduits with Vedernikov numbers \< 1 are simulated using the kinematic wave equation.

2)  The simulation of supercritical flow in conduits is done by the kinematic wave equation. This is used when all the following conditions occur -

> \- Flow is positive
>
> \- Water surface slope is less than theconduit slope
>
> \- The flow calculated by the Manning equation is less thatn the flow calculated using dynamic flow equations.
>
> \(3\) Surges or bores are simulated with some attenuation of the wave front using the full dynamic equation.

4)  A stationary hydraulic jump is simulated in EXTRAN through a combination of the kinematic wave equation for the supercritical conduit and the full dynamic equation for the critical conduit.

> This version of EXTRAN is a combination of implicit and explicit finite difference formulations for solving the nodal continuity equation, combined conduit momentum and continuity equation, and the boundary conditions of the solved network. Briefly the difference between explicit and implicit methods of solution is as follows:

1)  An explicit method uses only known information to calculate the unknown value at the new time step, or y = f(x).

2)  An implicit method solves for the unknown value at the new time step based on known and unknown information, or f(x,y) = 0.

> The nodal continuity equation is solved explicitly based on the last time step and value of the last iteration’s nodal depth and surface area. The boundary conditions are solved based on the last iteration value of flow in the outfall conduits. The flow in conduits is solved implicitly using the full dynamic flow equation. The kinematic wave flow is solved iteratively using the value of the last iteration’s upstream conduit cross sectional area and hydraulic radius.
>
> EXTRAN can thus be characterized as a point iterative method that utilizes the stability of an implicit method and the flexibility of an explicit method. Some of the advantages and power of explicit methods are:

1)  An explicit method eliminates convoluted numerical techniques for modeling boundary conditions required with implicit methods (Wubs, 1987).

2)  The flexibility afforded by eliminating the need for matrix solutions required by fully implicit models allows the creation of specialized conduit and diversion structures.

3)  The speed benefit from an implicit method is on the order of 5 to 10 based on the time step size, but not considering the added computational burden of implicit over the explicit methods and the accuracy limitations of implicit methods, which require time steps 1 to 2 times the Courant number. Thus the computational speed of an explicit model is comparable to an implicit model considering the computational overhead.

4)  Implicit methods are limited by the travel time a disturbance would take to traverse the conduit's computational length.

>
> EXTRAN uses a link-node description of the sewer network or system. This description in EXTRAN facilitates both the finite difference representation of the physical prototype and the mathematical solution of the gradually-varied unsteady flow (St. Venant) equations which form the mathematical basis of the model.
>
> The conduit system is idealized as a series of links or conduits which are connected at nodes or junctions. Links and nodes have well-defined properties which, taken together, permit representation of the entire pipe network. Moreover, the link-node concept is very useful in representing flow control devices. The specific properties of links and nodes are summarized in Table 14-2.
>
> Links transmit flow from node to node. The primary dependent variable in the links is the discharge, Q, which is calculated at the center of the conduit. Properties associated with the links are roughness, length, cross-sectional area, hydraulic radius, conduit depth, and surface width. Velocity, hydraulic radius, and the cross-sectional area of flow, or depth, are variable in the link and computed at the upstream and downstream ends of the conduit.
>
> The cross sectional area, surface width, and hydraulic radius are functions of the instantaneous depth of flow at the upstream and downstream ends of the conduit. The solution uses the average flow in each link during one iteration to calculate the cross sectional area, surface width, and hydraulic radius.

> Nodes are the storage elements of the system and correspond to manholes or pipe junctions in the physical system. The variables associated with a node are the nodal head and surface area. The nodal volume is related internally by the program to depth and surface area. The volume of the node at any time is equivalent to the water volume in the half conduit lengths connected to the node. Similarly, the surface area of the node at any time is equivalent to half of the water surface area of the connecting conduits.
>
> The primary node dependent variable is the head (H), or the node invert elevation plus water depth. The head is assumed to be changing over time but constant throughout any one node. (Note: A plot of head versus distance along the sewer network yields the hydraulic grade line, HGL, which can be plotted using the XSECT program invoked using Plot from the Extran menu).
>
> Inflows, such as inlet hydrographs, and outflows, such as weir diversions, take place at the nodes of the network. The node volume changes over time due to surface inflow, and the balance of flow entering and leaving the conduit. This change in nodal volume during a given time step, Ðt, forms the basis of head and discharge calculations in EXTRAN. The derivation and the solution of these connected node and conduit equations are discussed in Basic Equations of EXTRAN .
>
> **Basic Equations of EXTRAN**
>
> The basic differential equations for solving sewer flow in EXTRAN and other open channel unsteady flow problems are derived from the gradually varied, one-dimensional, unsteady flow equations for open channels, otherwise known as the *St. Venant* or shallow water equations (Lai, 1986). They are non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations and analytical solutions are unknown or unwieldy except in simplified situations. Numerical methods must be used to solve the equations since no general analytical solution exists. In addition to a numerical solution the equations require that upstream and downstream boundary conditions (BC) and initial conditions (IC) be defined by the user. The St. Venant equations are valid as long as the flow is a gradually varied one-dimensional flow; vertical acceleration is neglected; hydrostatic pressure; and the frictional resistance is the same as for steady flow.
>
> This release of Extran has an updated solution to the gradually varied, one-dimensional unsteady flow equations for open channels. The solution is implicit for conduit flow and explicit for junction depth. The program solves for the new time step flow implicitly using a point iteration scheme and combines the best points of the EXTRAN Version 3 and
>
> EXTRAN Version 4 solutions. The solution is iterative since it uses the conduit values at the n<sup>th</sup> and n+1<sup>st</sup> time steps to calculate the new time flow and head differential equations.

> Equation 2 is the form of the momentum equation used in EXTRAN. The seven terms in the momentum equation are, respectively:

1.  Local inertia \[∂Q/∂t\],

2.  Convective inertia \[∂(Q<sup>2</sup>/A)/∂x\],

3.  Pressure slope \[g·A·∂y/∂x\],

5.  Contraction/expansion loss (S<sub>c</sub>).

6.  Friction slope (S<sub>f</sub>),

7.  Bed slope (S<sub>o</sub>),

> In the EXTRAN Model the bottom slope (S<sub>o</sub>, or ∂h/∂x) is incorporated into the gradient of H, with ∂H/∂x defined as - ∂h/∂x + ∂y/∂x. The revised momentum equation using these definitions of bottom slope can be written as:

> This momentum equation must be modified to suit the requirements of EXTRAN. The purpose of these modifications to the continuity and momentum equations used by EXTRAN are:

1.  Eliminate the need for the ∂Q/∂x term in the continuity equation. EXTRAN uses a mean or center Q in conduits and the term ∂Q/∂x is not strictly valid.

2.  Eliminate one equation from the solution by creating a combined continuity-momentum equation.

3.  Linearize (∂Q<sup>2</sup>/A)/∂x by expanding the partial differential.

1.  The ∂(Q<sup>2</sup>/A)/∂x term in the momentum equation has a different derivation in EXTRAN Version 3 and Version 4 and 5, and

2.  An additional <sub>Qt+∆t</sub> is factored out of equation 18.

3.  The finite difference approximation of the friction slope S<sub>f</sub> is an average of the friction slope at the upstream and downstream end of the conduit, or the conduit center friction slope.

> 4\. An additional bound on the iterated values of junction head and conduit flows is used in EXTRAN version 5.

> The change in head is restricted \<1 percent in any one iteration. The change in Q is restricted \<10 percent in any one iteration.
>
> The main consequence of the above differences occurs during the rising and falling portions of the hydrograph. During steady flows the momentum equation reduces to a balance of the hydraulic head slope and friction slope. However, as the flow is increasing or decreasing the convective acceleration term increases in importance.

> This depth computation is based on the current net inflows to each node and the average nodal surface areas computed for the last time step and the current iteration. The new water surface elevation in the junction must be within the limits defined by the ground and invert elevations. The new junction elevation is calculated by weighting the last and current iteration using an under-relaxation parameter (ω). The change in depth is additionally constrained to be less than 1 percent in any one iteration. Larger changes are adjusted to 105 or 95 percent of the calculated depth.
>
> The continuity equation at the nodes is tested for convergence using the global parameter, SURJUN (Maximum Flow Change), defined in the JOB CONTROL dialog. The nodal convergence check constrains the error in the nodal continuity equation divided by the crown depth (Node ground elevation minus invert elevation) to be less than the value of SURJUN. Typical values of SURJUN are 0.005 and 0.001 (ft or m).
>
> **Automatic Time Step Selection**
>
> This method uses a variable time step. The time step the user enters on the Job Control dialog, ∆t, is the maximum allowable time step the program should use during the simulation. The program will select the current time step based on the minimum of the smallest conduit Courant number at the beginning of each long time step ∆t, and the smallest junction time step. The model determines the number of equal length small time steps required to equal ∆t.
>
> The conduit Courant number (C#) is:

> C# = L / \[V + √(g·D)\] (28) for enclosed conduits, and

>
> The junction time step (J#) is:

n+1

> J# = 10·\[Y
>
> If the smallest C# or J# equals or exceeds ∆t the program will use only one small time step. If the smallest C# or J# is less than ∆t the program will then compute the number of small time steps required to equal ∆t. The procedure used is:

1.  At the start of the simulation a time step of ∆t/2 is used, or 2 small time steps.

2.  Subsequently, the small time step is based on the current smallest conduit C# or junction time step J#.

3.  When convergence fails the time step is halved.

> 5\. In summary, the model works between minimum \[0.9·C#, J#\] and ∆t. The number of small time steps is always a whole number.

> The sequence of flow computations in the links and head calculations at the nodes can be summarized as:

1.  Determine the next time step size. Find the new step based on the preceding time step’s conduit velocity and depth using equations 28, 29 and 30 depending on the type of conduit. Find the number of time steps within this time step based on the calculated minimum C#, and the ∆t input on the Job Control dialog.

2.  Compute the first iteration discharge at t+∆t in all links based on preceding time step values of the head at connecting junctions.

3.  Compute the first iteration flow transfers by weirs, orifices, and pumps at time t+∆t based on preceding time step values of head at transfer junctions.

4.  Compute the first iteration head at all nodes at time t+∆t based on the average of initial time step flow and first iteration flow in all connecting conduits, plus flow transfers at the current time step.

5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 with new estimates for conduit flows and junction heads until all conduits and junctions converge. If the number of iterations exceeds ITMAX halve the time step.

> **Conduit Depth Calculations**

> This section discusses the EXTRAN translation from nodal depths to upstream and downstream conduit depths. The linking of conduit flows and junction depths discussed previously cannot be applied without modification to every conduit for the following reasons:

1.  The invert elevations of conduits which join at a node may be different since stormwater and sanitary sewer systems are frequently built with invert discontinuities.

2.  Critical depth may occur in the conduit and thereby restrict the discharge.

3.  Normal depth in the conduit may control the flow.

4.  The conduit may be dry.

> In all of these cases, or combination of cases, the flow must be computed by special techniques. Figure 14-2 shows each of the possibilities and describes the way in which surface area is assigned to the nodes.
>
> **Figure 14-2 EXTRAN Special Cases**
>
> EXTRAN converts the nodal water depth to the depth of flow above the invert of the connecting conduits then classifies the conduit as having a dry, subcritical, critical upstream, or critical downstream regime based on the following criteria:
>
> 1\. If the flow is positive, then the conduit is assumed:

- subcritical if the invert elevation of the downstream node is equal to the invert elevation of the downstream end of the conduit, and subcritical or critical otherwise,

- critical downstream if the minimum of the critical or normal conduit depth is greater than the downstream conduit depth,

- subcritical if the maximum of the critical or normal conduit depth is less than the downstream conduit depth,

- otherwise critical downstream and the value of variable FASNH must be calculated.

779

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> 2\. If the flow is negative, then the conduit is assumed

- subcritical if the invert elevation of the upstream node is equal to the invert elevation of the upstream end of the conduit, and subcritical or critical otherwise,

- critical upstream if the critical conduit depth is greater than the upstream conduit depth, and subcritical if the critical conduit depth is less than the upstream conduit depth.

3.  If the upstream depth is positive and the downstream depth is zero then the conduit is dry if the upstream HGL is less than the invert of the downstream end of the conduit. The conduit is assumed sub-critical if the invert elevation of the downstream junction is equal to the invert elevation of the downstream end of the conduit, and critical downstream otherwise.

4.  If the downstream depth is positive and the upstream depth is zero then the conduit is dry if the downstream HGL is less than the invert of the upstream end of the conduit. The conduit is assumed subcritical if the invert elevation of the upstream junction is equal to the invert elevation of the upstream end of the conduit, and critical upstream otherwise.

> Next, based on the flow regime of the conduit, EXTRAN computes the conduit surface width and then assigns the conduit surface area to the upstream and downstream nodes according to the following criteria:

1.  For the normal situation in which both pipe inverts are submerged and the flow is sub-critical throughout the conduit, the surface area of that conduit is assigned equally to the two connecting junctions. The surface area is calculated as the product of the mean of the upstream and downstream top widths multiplied by half the conduit length.

2.  If a critical flow section is detected at the downstream end of a conduit, then the entire surface area for that conduit is assigned to the upstream node.

3.  If a critical section occurs at the upstream end, then the entire conduit surface area is assigned to the downstream node.

4.  In the case of a dry pipe (pipe inverts unsubmerged), the surface area is zero, the velocity is set equal to zero, and cross-sectional area and hydraulic radius are set to the minimum conduit depth defined in the "Modify Conduits" dialog under Job Control.

5.  If the pipe is dry only at the upstream end, then all surface area for the conduit is assigned to the downstream junction.

> Note that adverse flow in the absence of a critical section is treated as in (1) immediately above. If a critical section occurs upstream, then all surface area for the adverse pipe is assigned downstream as in (3).
>
> The assignment of nodal surface area, based on the top width and length of the conduit, is essential to the proper calculation of head changes computed at each node from the junction mass continuity equation. Following the surface area assignment, EXTRAN computes the current weighted average values of cross-sectional area, velocity, and hydraulic radius for each conduit.
>
> EXTRAN also computes the depth at orifice junctions for all sump orifices that are not flowing full. The condition of the sump orifices are either critical downstream or subcritical.
>
> Once these depth and surface area corrections are applied, the computations of head and discharge can proceed in the normal way for the current time-step. Note that any of these special situations may begin and end at various times and places during simulation. EXTRAN detects these automatically in Subroutine HEAD.

2.  normal,

3.  critical depth upstream, and

> It should be noted that these designations refer strictly to the assignment of upstream and downstream nodal surface area and conduit depths.
>
> EXTRAN computes the critical and normal depths corresponding to a given flow in a conduit using the critical flow and Manning uniform flow equations, respectively. Tables of normalized values for the cross-sectional area, hydraulic radius and surface width of each conduit class are initialized to speed the computations of critical and normal depth.
>
> The dimensionless tables for each conduit class consists of 26 numbers or 25 increments of depth for cross sectional area and topwidth. The depths range from 0.0 to 1.0 with increments of 0.04. The critical depth is calculated from setting the Froude number to 1 and finding the position of the critical depth corresponding to the conduit flow. The normal depth is calculated from Manning’s equation and finding the position of the normal depth corresponding to the conduit flow. The depths are then interpolated linearly using the two nearest depth levels.
>
> **Special Conduit Flow Conditions**
>
> Switching between the normal flow and dynamic flow equation for a conduit is controlled automatically by EXTRAN. The Froude number or the Vedernikov number of the conduit determines the use of the normal flow equation or the dynamic flow equation. Froude numbers \> 1.0 (supercritical flow) cause the conduit flow to be calculated from Manning’s equation using the upstream cross-sectional area and hydraulic radius of the conduit. Vedernikov numbers \< 1.0 (roll wave formation) also trigger the use of Manning’s equation.
>
> Automatic switching based on the Froude number or Vedernikov number is new to EXTRAN 5. All versions of EXTRAN had automatic switching to the normal flow equation when all of the following three conditions occur in a conduit:

1.  Positive Flow - This criterion is necessary because EXTRAN automatically designates the highest invert elevation as the upstream node and the lowest as the downstream node. This adjustment (if made) is printed out by the model. Positive flow is always from the upstream to the downstream node. Any initial flow entered by the user is multiplied by -1 if the upstream and downstream nodes are changed by the model.

2.  The water surface slope in the conduit is less than the conduit slope.

3.  The flow calculated from Manning’s equation using the upstream cross-sectional area and hydraulic radius is less than the flow calculated by the full dynamic flow equation.

> **Flow and Head Computation during Surcharge and Flooding**
>
> When the flow in a conduit becomes pressurized the free surface condition is maintained by using a fictitious slot (i.e., the Preissmann slot) to account for compressibility effects during surcharging. The width of the narrow slot characterizes the elastic properties of the water and sewer walls. The slot width is calculated by assuming a speed for the surcharged flow. A few examples used by other models include 50 m/s \[Sjoberg, 1981\]. The default value in EXTRAN is 0.005·W, where W is the conduit width.
>
> Surcharge is a condition in which closed conduit flows full and under pressure. Sewer simulation is the prediction of the heads, velocities, and flows in an existing or predetermined network. Sewer design is the sizing of new sewer diameters that will not allow surcharging. The prevention of street flooding has a longer return period than the design of a sewer system which has the goal of preventing surcharge.

> **EXTRAN 5 (XP-EXTRAN)**
>
> **EXTRAN 2**
>
> A surge tank was used at surcharged nodes. This maintained the flow continuity at nodes at the cost of failing to predict surcharge and flood elevations realistically.
>
> **EXTRAN 3**
>
> A surcharge iteration was implemented to realistically predict surcharge heads. The assumptions were: (1) the nodal surface was zero when the node was surcharged, and (2) the net flow into the node was zero. The conduit flow was calculated as though the water surface extended to the surface with zero surface width. A Taylor series expansion was used to estimate 6H/6Q for conduits and diversion structures. Drawbacks to this solution included convoluted rules for setting the junction surcharge level.
>
> **EXTRAN 4**
>
> A default surface area for all nodes was included in the model to alleviate strictures on the junction surcharge level. This was used in all solutions. One solution in EXTRAN avoided the application of a different set of governing equations during surcharge by retaining a small pseudo-surface area for each conduit. A transition of conduit surface area is provided between the "almost full" conduit and a small "Priessmann slot" to maintain free-surface flow.
>
> The transition zone is from the 96 percent conduit depth to a point 1.25 times conduit diameter above the top. The conduit width (W) decreases quadratically from the conduit width at 0.96·W to a width equal to 0.01·W at a depth of 1.25 diameters. The conduit cross sectional area increases but the hydraulic radius remains equal to R<sub>f</sub>.
>
> When the junction head is greater than 1.25 times the junction crown elevation the width stays constant at 0.5 percent of the conduit width (or vertical dimension) allowing the same free-surface flow equations 12 and 18 to be used during the entire simulation.
>
> 782

SECTION 15: THEORY

> **EXTRAN 5 (EXTRAN-XP)**
>
> The surcharge iteration used in EXTRAN 3 and continued in EXTRAN 4 was discontinued. A "Priessmann slot" technique for linking open channel and surcharged flow is used exclusively by the model. Warning messages concerning gaps between conduits at a node were eliminated.
>
> Special conditions accounted for are surcharged closed conduits, overtopping open channels, and rectangular culvert calculations for wetted perimeter.
>
> When a closed conduit is surcharged EXTRAN assumes that a vertical slot is present at the top of the conduit. This Priessmann slot allows the same conduit momentum equation to be used during both surcharged and non-surcharged flow. The width of the slot is given by the product of the conduit width (WIDE) and the parameter WSLOT described above. When the depth is greater than 1.25 the conduit depth (DEEP) is used. When the depth is between 1.25\*DEEP and DEEP the width of the slot is a quadratic function of the top width and WSLOT\*WIDE.
>
> Open channels that overtop their banks are modeled as weir flow over the sides of the channel. The overflow is assigned to the upstream junction and is listed in the summary output as weir discharge. This replaces the HYDRAD messages of previous versions of EXTRAN, which simply set the depth of the open channel to the maximum conduit depth.
>
> Two results are now possible when the water surface elevation of the junction breaks the ground elevation, a flooded junction with surface outflow of excess water, and a ponded junction that allows the flooded water access to the network when capacity is available. These parameters are defined in the "Junction Defaults" dialog under Job Control.
>
> **Ground and Invert Elevations**
>
> The ground elevation of a junction is the elevation at which the assumption of pressure flow is no longer valid. Normally, this is the street or ground elevation; however, if the manholes are bolted down, the ground elevation should be set sufficiently high so that the simulated water surface elevation does not exceed it. When the hydraulic head must exceed the ground elevation to maintain continuity at the junction, the program allows the excess junction inflow to "overflow onto the ground" and become lost from the system for the remainder of the simulation period (but the "lost" water is included in the final continuity check).
>
> If an open channel (trapezoidal or irregular cross section) is connected to a junction, EXTRAN will compute the ground elevation (GRELEV). The elevation where surface flooding occurs is set at the elevation where the HGL exceeds the defined cross section. It is important that cross-sections are defined to be large enough to convey the peak flow.
>
> Nodal flooding of open-channel systems should only be allowed if the HGL elevation cannot significantly rise above a certain elevation. Occasionally it is necessary to perform routing on the water that surcharges onto the ground. In this case, the ground surface (e.g., a street and gutter system) must be simulated as a conduit in order to route the flows and maintain continuity. In addition, manholes must be simulated as vertical pipes in order to transport water to and from the surface channel. Since an infinite slope (vertical) is not permitted, equivalent pipes are used for the manholes. With this arrangement, water may surcharge (move vertically out of a "manhole-pipe) and return to the sewer system at a downstream location through another "manhole-pipe." Inflow constrictions by inlets etc. can be simulated as orifices if their hydraulic characteristics are known. With this extra effort, dual "major" (street surface) and "minor" (subsurface sewer network) drainage systems can be simulated.
>
> **Flow Control or Diversion Devices**
>
> The concept of link-node can be extended to include devices which divert stormwater out of a combined sewer system or relieve the storm load on interceptors. In EXTRAN, all diversions are assumed to take place at a node and are handled as inter-nodal transfers. Diversion devices modeled by EXTRAN include: Weirs (both side-flow and transverse), orifices, pumps, and outfalls. These are discussed in the paragraphs below.
>
> **Storage Devices, Ponds and Lakes**
>
> In-line or off-line storage devices act as flow control devices by providing for storage of excessive upstream flows thereby attenuating and lagging the wet weather flow hydrograph from the upstream area. Examples of in-line storage are dry and wet detention ponds, and lakes.

783

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> Conceptually, storage junctions are "tanks" of constant surface area over their depth. A storage "tank" may be placed at any node in the system. The elevation of the top of the tank is specified in the storage junction data and must be at least as high as the highest pipe crown at the junction. If this condition is violated, the system will go into simulated surcharge before the highest pipe is flowing full.
>
> Note that the only difference between a storage junction and a regular junction is that added surface area in the amount defined for the storage node (ASTORE) is added to that of the connecting pipes. Note also that the conduit obvert (ZCROWN) is set at the top of storage. When the hydraulic head at junction exceeds ZCROWN, the junction becomes surcharged, and a small slot (Priessman slot) as described elsewhere in this section is used by the model.
>
> The surface area of the storage junction is either constant or variable. If variable the relationship of area versus depth may be defined by a power function:
>
> Area = Carea × Depth ^ Earea
>
> where, Area = area \[acres, hectares\],
>
> Carea = coefficient \[acres, hectares\], and
>
> Earea = exponent.
>
> or, an arbitrary stage-area-volume relationship may be input using the dialogs to represent detention ponds and lakes. The depth-area data is integrated to determine the depth-volume relationship for the junction. Routing is performed by ordinary level-surface reservoir methods. This type of storage facility should **not** be allowed to surcharge. The user should guarantee that the pond will not surcharge by setting the ground elevation of the node to the topmost stage of the pond.
>
> Note the large variation in surface area units between constant and variable storage areas. Constant storage has units of ft^2 or m^2 and variable storage has units of acres or hectares.
>
> **Orifices**
>
> The purpose of the orifice generally is to divert excess stormwater from the stormwater system during dry weather periods and to restrict the entry of stormwater into the sanitary interceptors during periods of runoff. The orifice may divert the flow to another pipe, a pumping station or an off-line storage tank.
>
> The Orifice Diversion dialog shows two typical diversions:

1.  a dropout or sump orifice, and

2.  a side outlet orifice.

All equations in the weir section remain the same except that Y<sub>up</sub> and Y<sub>dn</sub> are switched so that Yup remains as the "upstream" head. Also, flow reversal at a side-flow weir causes it to behave more like a transverse weir and consequently the exponent **a** in equation 33 is set to 1.5.
>
> **Weirs with Tide Gates**
>
> Frequently, weirs are installed together with a tide gate at points of overflow into the receiving waters. Flow across the weir is restricted by the tide gate, which may be partially closed at times. This is accounted for by reducing the effective driving head across the weir according to an empirical factor published by Armco (undated):

>
> **Pump Stations**
>
> An EXTRAN pump station is conceptually represented as either an in-line lift station or an off-line node representing a wet-well, from which the contents are pumped to another node in the system according to a programmed rule curve. Alternatively, either in-line or off-line pumps may use a three-point pump curve (head versus pumped outflow). For an in-line lift station, the pump rate is based on the water depth, Y, at the pump junction. The step-function rule is as follows:
>
> Pump Rate = R<sub>1</sub> for 0 \< Y \< Y<sub>1</sub>
>
> 787
>
> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> R<sub>2</sub> Y<sub>1</sub> ≤ Y \< Y<sub>2</sub>
>
> R<sub>3</sub> Y<sub>2</sub> ≤ Y \< Y<sub>3</sub> (47)
>
> When Y = 0, the pump rate is the inflow rate to the pump junction.
>
> Inflows to the off-line pump must be diverted from the main sewer system through an orifice, a weir, or a pipe. The influent to the wet-well node must be a free discharge regardless of the diversion structure. The pumping rule curve is based on the volume of water in the storage junction. A schematic presentation of the pump rule is shown in the Pump Diversion dialog. The step-function rule operates as follows:
>
> 1\. Up to three wet-well volumes are prespecified as input data for each pump station: *V*<sub>1</sub> \< *V*<sub>2</sub> \< *V*<sub>3</sub>, where *V*<sub>3</sub> is
>
> the maximum capacity of the wet well.
>
> 2\. Three pumping rates are prespecified as input data for each station. The pump rate is selected automatically by
>
> EXTRAN depending on the volume, *V*, in the wet-well, as follows:
>
> Pump Rate = R<sub>1</sub> for 0 \< *V* \< *V*<sub>1</sub>
>
> R<sub>2</sub> *V*<sub>1</sub> ≤ *V* \< V<sub>2</sub>
>
> R<sub>3</sub> *V*<sub>2</sub> ≤ *V* \< *V*<sub>3</sub> (48)
>
> 3\. A mass balance of pumped outflow and inflow is performed in the wetwell during the model simulation period.
>
> 4\. If the wet-well goes dry, the pump rate is reduced below rate Rl until it just equals the inflow rate. When the
>
> inflow rate again equals or exceeds R<sub>1</sub>, the pumping rate goes back to operating on the rule curve.
>
> 5\. If *V*<sub>3</sub> is exceeded in the wet-well, the inflow to the storage node is reduced until it does not exceed the maximum
>
> pumped flow. When the inflow falls below the maximum pumped flow, the inflow "gates" are opened. The program automatically steps down the pumping rate by the operating rule of (2) as the inflows and wet-well volumes decrease over time.
>
> A conceptual head-discharge curve for a pump is shown in the Pump Diversion dialog. When this method is used for either type of pump, an iteration is performed until the dynamic head difference between the upstream and downstream nodes on either side of the pump corresponds to the flow given on the pump curve. In other words, the pump curve replaces equation 12.
>
> **Outfall Structures**
>
> EXTRAN simulates both weir outfalls and free outfalls. Either type may be subject to a backwater condition and protected by a tide gate. A weir outfall is a weir which discharges directly to the receiving waters according to relationships given previously in the weir section. The free outfall is simply an outfall conduit which discharges to a receiving water body under given backwater conditions. The free outfall may be truly "free" if the elevation of the receiving waters is low enough (i.e., the end of the conduit is elevated over the receiving waters), or it may consist of a backwater condition. In the former case, the water surface at the free outfall is taken as critical or normal depth, whichever is less. If backwater exists, the receiving water elevation is taken as the water surface elevation at the free outfall.
>
> Up to 50 different head versus time relationships can be used as boundary conditions. Any outfall junction can be assigned to any of the 50 boundary conditions.

788

> SECTION 15: THEORY
>
> When there is a tide gate on an outfall conduit, a check is made to see whether or not the hydraulic head at the upstream end of the outfall pipe exceeds that outside the gate. If it does not, the discharge through the outfall is equated to zero. If the driving head is positive, the water surface elevation at the outfall junction is set in the same manner as that for a free outfall subjected to a backwater condition. Note that even if the tide gate is closed, water can still enter and fill an empty outfall pipe as sometimes happens at the beginning of a simulation.
>
> **Boundary Conditions**
>
> The following boundary conditions are modeled by the EXTRAN Model:
>
> 1\. H level functions at internal nodes and outfall nodes.

- Free Outfall - The free outfall boundary condition has been modified to allow critical depth, normal depth, or the minimum of critical and normal depth. The previous solution (EXTRAN 4) calculated the minimum of the critical or normal depth in the conduits connecting to an outfall node.

- Constant elevation.

- Stage history tabulated functions, H(t).

- Tidal (sinusoidal) time series, H(t).

2.  Q level functions at internal and outfall nodes, Q(t).

3.  Rating curves, Q = a·y , at internal and outfall nodes.

4.  Rating tables of Q versus y at internal and outfall nodes.

> EXTRAN computes the current value of hydrograph inflow to each input node in the sewer system at each large time-step. It then reads current values of hydrograph ordinates from an external interface file if the Runoff Block (or any other block) immediately precedes the EXTRAN Block, and/or from line input runoff hydrographs (from the user inflow dialog). EXTRAN then performs a linear interpolation between hydrograph input points and computes the discharge at each input node at the full time step, t+∆t.
>
> EXTRAN provides for input of up to 100 inflow (standard value, actual value is defined in SWMM, CFG files) hydrographs as input data lines in cases where it is desirable to run EXTRAN alone without prior use of an upstream model or to add additional input hydrographs, either at the same or different nodes, to those computed by the upstream model.
>
> EXTRAN computes seven tide coefficients (if needed), Al through A7, which are in turn used to compute the current tide elevation according to the Fourier series:
>
> HTIDE = A1 + A2 sin wt + A3 sin 2wt + A4 sin 3wt
>
> \+ A5 cos wt + A6 cos 2wt + A7 cos 3wt
>
> where, t = current time, hours (units of seconds are used internally),
>
> w = angular frequency 2 pi radians/W (radius/hr), and
>
> W = tidal period in hours.
>
> Typical tidal periods are 12.5 or 25 hours. The coefficients A2 through A7 are developed by an iterative technique in which a sinusoidal series is fitted to the set of tidal stage-time points supplied as input data.
>
> EXTRAN evaluates the tidal equations, or interpolates the stage history boundary condition, or uses a lookup table for an outfall defined by a rating curve. It determines the tidal coefficients during the simulation to determine the current tidal elevation for multiple boundary conditions.
>
> Generally, the boundary conditions are calculated using the following procedures:
>
> 789
>
> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> 1\. Compute current elevation of receiving water backwater. Depending on the tidal index, the backwater condition will be constant, tidal or below the system outfalls (effectively non-existent). The tidally-varied backwater condition is computed by a Fourier series about a mean time equal to the first coefficient, A1. There are six possible boundary conditions:

1)  Free discharge defined by the normal depth, critical depth, or the minimum of the normal or critical depth.

2)  Constant elevation. The depth never falls lower than the depth defined by the outfall elevation, but higher depths are possible depending on the flow in the outfall conduit.

3)  Tidal boundary conditions calculated from coefficients supplied by the user of the model, or generated by the model from tidal data. The tidally-varied backwater condition is computed by a Fourier series about a mean time equal to the first coefficient, A1.

4)  Stage history, or h(t) calculated by interpolating the time series.

5)  Flow history, or Q(t) calculated by interpolating the time series.

6)  A rating curve is used to set the node depth, Q(h). The program interpolates the node depth based on a calculated Q.

<!-- -->

2.  The outfall depth can be assigned in one of three ways: normal depth, critical depth, or the minimum of normal or critical depth for the flow in the outfall conduit. These three options apply to all boundary conditions.

3.  A conduit that is surcharged has an upper limit of the conduit depth as the depth boundary condition. This may be a cause of physical oscillations as a reflective wave travels backward through the network system.

3\. 3. For outfall conduits with tide gates there is no flow when the computed junction depth is less than the boundary depth.

> **Initial Conditions**
>
> Initial flows in conduits may be input by the user using the conduit dialog. For each conduit, EXTRAN then computes the normal depth corresponding to the initial flow. Junction heads are then approximated as the average of the heads of adjacent conduits for purposes of beginning the computation sequence. The initial volume of water computed in this manner is included in the continuity check. A more accurate initial condition for any desired set of flows may be established by letting EXTRAN "warm up" with the initial inflows and restarted using the "hot start" feature explained earlier in the manual.
>
> Initial heads at junctions may be input by the user with the conduit dialogs. The model does not estimate the initial conduit flow if the conduit flow is entered as zero. Initial heads at junctions with a sump orifice are increased by 0.96 times the equivalent pipe diameter of the orifice at the start of the simulation.
>
> **Pit or Junction Losses**
>
> EXTRAN uses a point junction formulation for calculating the depth of water in a junction. The use of a point junction formulation has been questioned by Joliffe \[1981\] who suggests a momentum junction formulation is superior for predicting the combination of pipe flows, and a weir formulation is superior to the point junction formulation for dividing flows. The point junction formulation is only adequate when the head loss at pits are small \[Price, 1981\]. An energy balance at manhole (j) for all incoming and outgoing conduits (i) can be formulated as:

1.  The depth of flow in the connecting conduits.

2.  The depth of flow in the manhole.

3.  The angle between the incoming and outgoing conduits. This is assumed to be 180° in the EXTRAN Model.

4.  The type of flow (subcritical or supercritical flow).

> **Oscillations during a Hydraulic Jump**
>
> A hydraulic jump is simulated in EXTRAN by switching between the normal flow equation and the dynamic flow equation. This is automatically done by the program. The criteria the program uses is discussed in the section on Normal Flow.
>
> Numerical difficulties in modelling a moving hydraulic jump include \[Sjosberg, 1981\]:

1.  The moving on the jump from one calculation reach to another within one time step, ∆t.

2.  Large oscillations from the storage and release of water occur from moving hydraulic jumps.

> During supercritical flow the junction does not allow a hydraulic jump and the inflow to the junction is similar to a free outfall. The reason it is a free outfall is that during supercritical flow a wave cannot travel upstream (i.e., no information from downstream junctions and conduits can be used for the upstream solution).
>
> **Irregular Closed Conduits**
>
> At user selected depths the program uses cross sectional area, wetted perimeter, and top width to calculate the dimensionless curves for cross-sectional, top width, and hydraulic radius. The wetted perimeter is calculated as the square root of the hypothenuse.
>
> **Irregular Open Channels**
>
> For channels, EXTRAN reads data in HEC-2 format then computes normalised values of cross-sectional area, hydraulic radius (with variable Manning’s n), and top width. Interpolation of these curves during an EXTRAN simulation is identical to that performed for regular cross sections where the normalised curves have been predetermined and stored in Block Data. You should be aware that the dimensionless curves consist of 25 depth increments, and the cross sectional area, wetted perimeter, and top width entered are interpolated to fill out the table. Sufficient information should be entered to define the properties of the channel accurately when translated into the dimensionless table.
>
> Irregular cross-section data is entered in the same format as used in the HEC-2 computer program. In fact, the relevant data may be extracted from an existing HEC-2 input data file using the option on the conduit dialog.

The vertical differentiation of conduit roughness as defined by the special conduit factor dialog is a quadratic equation ranging from the peak at zero depth to normal roughness at the transition depth.

Initial transients in the model are dampened by increasing the roughness coefficient of each conduit by a factor of ten. This optional technique decreases oscillations at the beginning of a simulation. If used, the transition to normal roughness takes 9 large time steps (∆t).

The combined momentum-continuity equation uses the difference of the average cross-section area (A) at the n-1 and n+1 time steps with the denominator being the larger ∆t plus the sum of the smaller time steps (∆t). The numerator uses the average velocity at the current iteration.

**Inlet Control Theory**

The design equations used to develop the inlet control nomographs are based on the research conducted by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) under the sponsorship of the Bureau of Public Roads (now the Federal Highway Administration). Seven progress reports were produced as a result of this research. Of these, the first and fourth through seventh reports dealt with the hydraulics of pipe and box culvert entrances, with and without tapered inlets (4,7 to 10) These reports were one source of the equation coefficients and exponents, along with other references and unpublished FHWA notes on the development of the nomographs. (56,57)

The two basic conditions of the inlet control depend upon whether the inlet end of the culvert is or is not submerged by the upstream headwater. If the inlet is not submerged, the inlet performs as a weir. If the inlet is submerged, the inlet performs as an orifice. Equations are available for each of the above conditions.

Between the unsubmerged and the submerged conditions there is a transition zone for which the NBS research provided by drawing a curve between and tangent to the curves defined by the unsubmerged and submerged equations. In most cases, the transition zone is the short and the curve is easily constructed.

Table I1 contains the unsubmerged and submerged inlet control design equations. Note that there are two forms of the unsubmerged equation. Form (1) is based on the specific head at critical depth, adjusted with two correction factors, Form (2) is an exponential equation similar to a weir equation. Form (1) is preferable from a theoretical standpoint, but form (2) is easier to apply and is the only documented form of equation for some of the inlet control nomographs. Either form of unsubmerged inlet control equation will produce adequate results.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

The CUHP program was originally developed in 1971 by Ben Urbonas and Stewart McGuire (URS/KEN R. WHITE COMPANY). The program has been regularly revised for the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District by a number of companies and individuals including, Gary Walkovitz (URS COMPANY), Ben Urbonas and David Lombard (UDFCD), C. R. Wuerz (Merrick and Company), Young S. Yoon and Nien-Sheng Hsu (Boyle Engineering Corporation).

**INTRODUCTION**

The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure Computer Program (CUHPD) has been continually updated since 1971 under the direction of Ben Urbonas of Urban Drainage and Flood Control District.

> xpswmm Reference Manual

> Some of the major modifications incorporated into the PC version are as follows:

1.  Variable infiltration with time,

2.  Modifying infiltration by storm event,

3.  Overriding of unit hydrograph shape.

4.  Write output to file for use with flood flow frequency analysis program.

5.  Write storm hydrographs to an output file for subsequent use with Multi-Plan River Routing Routine of HEC-1.

6.  Compile with FORTRAN compiler for IBM PC,

7.  Write storm hydrographs to output file for subsequent use with the routing routine portion of UDSWM2-PC (a modified version of the Runoff Block of EPA's SWMM).

8.  Modify input format to agree with the 1984 Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM) revisions.

9.  Dimensional and common statements and some of the logic in the earlier version were modified to be adoptable on an IBM PC-XT.

<!-- -->

7.  Plotting routines included in the earlier version are eliminated.

8.  Some input data requirements are simplified to facilitate data preparation effort. It is no longer necessary to define entire hyetographs or to define basin parameters Ct and Cp.

9.  The program has, as an option, a capability of estimating hydrographs for small drainage areas (generally less than 90 acres) for which the original CUHP method is not applicable. The resulting flood peaks in many cases are generally comparable, but not identical to those estimated by the Rational Formula as specified in the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. To exercise this option, input the time of concentration (Tc) as computed by the rational formula procedure described in the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual.

10. The program can, as an option, create an input data file containing storm hydrograph values for the purpose of combining and routing these hydrographs through the application of UDSWM2-PC, a version of the runoff block of the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) originally developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and modified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

xpswmm Reference Manual

Because of the speed of the computer, it is not necessary to vary the unit duration of the unit hydrograph in order to save manual calculation time. It is recommended that a 5-minute unit hydrograph be used for all work; however, the user has the option of using any unit time provided the rainfall data used has the same unit time and a hyetograph is defined by the user.

If the 1-hour rainfall input option is used, the user may choose either 5-minute or 10-minute unit duration only; however the 5-minute duration is recommended for all 2-hour storms.

The user needs to input the following basin parameters to generate a unit and storm hydrograph:

> 1\. 1. Input Parameters.
>
> The following basin parameters are needed for the program to generate a unit and storm hydrograph.

1)  Area - Basin area in square miles

2)  Basin Length - The length in miles from the downstream design point of the basin or sub-basin along the main drainageway to the high point on its respective basin or sub-basin. When a basin is subdivided into a series of sub-basins, the sub-basin length used shall include the distance required for runoff to reach the major channel from the farthest point in the sub-basin.

3)  Centroid Distance - Distance in miles from the design point of the basin or sub-basin along the main drainageway to its respective basin or sub-basin centroid.

4)  Percent Impervious - Portion of the basin surface which is impervious in percent.

5)  Basin Slope - Weighted average slope of the basin in feet per foot. See instructions in the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual to determine the weighted slope.

6)  As an option for small urbanized areas, (e.g. less than 90 acres), you may enter time of concentration in minutes. Procedure for estimating time of concentration is given in the Criteria Manual. By specifying the time of concentration, hydrograph peaks will be computed and displayed using both the CUHP method and the Rational Formula. This option will be exercised only if the 1-hour rainfall depth option is used for storm data (Card B2).

7)  Pervious retention - Maximum depression storage on pervious surfaces in inches.

8)  Impervious retention - Maximum depression storage on impervious surfaces in inches.

9)  Infiltration rate - Initial infiltration rate for pervious surfaces in the basin in inches per hour. If this entry is used by itself, it will be used as a constant infiltration rate throughout the storm. If the next two entries are made, then this value will be used as the initial infiltration rate in Horton's equation.

10) Decay Exponential decay coefficient in Horton's equation in "per second" units.

11) Final infiltration - Final infiltration rate in Horton's equation in inches per hour.

12) Nullifier of Rainfall Loss Adjustment Factors Entered with Rainfall - To be used if rainfall loss adjustment factors entered with rainfall data are to be nullified (optional).

>
> The unit hydrograph is developed by the computer using the algorithm used in the 1984 revision of the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. As noted before, the coefficients C t and C p are computed by the program; however, they can be specified by the user as an option.
>
> The shaping of the unit hydrograph also relies on proportioning the widths at 50% and 75% of the unit hydrograph peak. The proportioning is based on 0.35 of the width at 5010 of peak being ahead of the "time to peak" and 0.45 of the width at 75% of peak being ahead of the "time to peak". These proportioning factors were selected after observing a number of unit hydrographs derived from the rainfall/runoff data collected by the U.S.G.S. for the District.
>
> It is possible for the user to override the unit hydrograph widths and the proportioning of these widths built into the program. For drainage and flood studies within the District, the program values shall be used. If the user has derived unit hydrographs from reliable rainfall-runoff data for a study basin and can develop a "calibrated" unit hydrograph for this basin, this option permits reshaping the unit hydrograph accordingly.

C. Rational Formula Option For Small Catchments

The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure (CUHP) is applicable for basins that are generally larger than 90 acres. When the procedure is applied to smaller basins, it has a tendency to overestimate or underestimate peak runoff rates. The Colorado Urban Drainage and Flood Control District's "Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual" suggests the use of the Rational Method for such small basins. In the CUHPE/PC version, an optional routine is incorporated which computes

802

SECTION 15: THEORY

peak runoff rates based on the Rational Method. In addition to basin parameters required for the CUHP, the user may specify the time of concentration for the basin of interest and the CUHPE/PC will then compute and display both peak runoff rates as computed by the CUHP and the Rational Method for comparison purposes. The program also contains a routine which modifies the CUHP procedure for generating hydrographs in such a way that their peaks

become compatible with those by the Rational Method for small drainage areas.

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> The Colorado Urban Hydrograph Procedure Computer Program (CUHPD) has been continually updated since 1971 under the direction of Ben Urbonas of Urban Drainage and Flood Control District.
>
> Some of the major modifications incorporated into the PC version are as follows:

1.  Variable infiltration with time,

2.  Modifying infiltration by storm event,

3.  Overriding of unit hydrograph shape.

4.  Write output to file for use with flood flow frequency analysis program.

5.  Write storm hydrographs to an output file for subsequent use with Multi-Plan River Routing Routine of HEC-1.

6.  Compile with FORTRAN compiler for IBM PC,

7.  Write storm hydrographs to output file for subsequent use with the routing routine portion of UDSWM2-PC (a modified version of the Runoff Block of EPA's SWMM).

8.  Modify input format to agree with the 1984 Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual (USDCM) revisions.

9.  Dimensional and common statements and some of the logic in the earlier version were modified to be adoptable on an IBM PC-XT.

10. Plotting routines included in the earlier version are eliminated.

11. Some input data requirements are simplified to facilitate data preparation effort. It is no longer necessary to define entire hyetographs or to define basin parameters Ct and Cp.

12. The program has, as an option, a capability of estimating hydrographs for small drainage areas (generally less than 90 acres) for which the original CUHP method is not applicable. The resulting flood peaks in many cases are generally comparable, but not identical to those estimated by the Rational Formula as specified in the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. To exercise this option, input the time of concentration (Tc) as computed by the rational formula procedure described in the Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual.

13. The program can, as an option, create an input data file containing storm hydrograph values for the purpose of combining and routing these hydrographs through the application of UDSWM2-PC, a version of the runoff block of the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) originally developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and modified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

1)  A constant infiltration rate throughout the storm can be specified. To use a constant infiltration rate, the user needs to enter only the initial infiltration rate (INFL).

2)  A variable infiltration rate based on Horton's equation can be calculated. Horton's equation is:

If the user has entered rainfall loss adjustment factors with the rainfall data and does not wish to use them for a given basin during a computer run, he can nullify these correction factors by enabling the Ignore Global Correction Factors Flag (XNUL) for the individual basin data (card D). Enabling XNUL will cause the computer to use only the rainfall loss factors entered with basin data.

If the 1-hour depth input option is to be used, the user needs to identify the design storm and then enter the 1-hour depth and the return period (i.e. 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, or 100-year). The design hyetograph will then be computed by the program using the 2-hour storm distribution recommended in the District's Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. The unit time specified under basin data (use only 5-minute or 10-minute unit time with the 1-hour option) has to be consistent with the time increment used for the tabulation of the design storm. Namely, if a 5-minute unit hydrograph is to be used, then the rainfall data should also be entered using 5-minute time increments.

When the procedure is utilized for larger drainage areas greater than 90 acres, a warning statement will appear in the output.

> **3. Rational Method Options.**

> The CUHPE/PC program has two options under which it will generate peak flows using the Rational Method.

>
> Under the second option (i.e. ICIA = I on Card C) the user is required to provide an input value for TC and the 1-hour rainfall depth. The program will then generate a storm hydrograph that has been modified using the input TC and will also calculate the peak flow using the Rational Method. This second option is recommended only for areas smaller than 90 acres and should not be used at all for areas larger than 160 acres. Also, this second option has only been tested for areas larger than 10 acres in size and should not be used for smaller sub-catchments.

***SECTION 17: REAL TIME CONTROL  
*17.1 Introduction to Real Time Control**

Real Time Control (RTC) allows the user to simulate physical changes in the network structure

i.e. change speed of pumps, opening and closing of gates etc to both control the flows and water elevation throughout a distribution network.

For example, this would allow for large wet weather events and either to redirect flows to an offline storage and/pr another less loaded portion of the network to prevent either floods or sewage overflow at specific points.

The **RTC** model is selected from the **Configuration Menu**.

> <img src="./media/image619.jpg" style="width:5.97639in;height:3.36389in" />

After the **Real Time Control** is selected the following dialog box appears. Within the dialog is all data pertaining to both RTC control elements and their associated sensors.

The dialog box is made up of 3 main sections

\- A definition of RTC elements and their associated sensors (located in the top left hand corner)

> \- Properties of each RTC control element (bottom half of the dialog box)
>
> \- Properties of each sensor (top right section)
>
> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> <img src="./media/image620.jpg" style="width:5.72986in;height:5.16667in" />
>
> An RTC control element can consist of a conduit, node, pump, weir orifice or rating curve. Depending on the input RTC control properties these elements are controlled between minimum and maximum operating conditions. The change in operation over input ramp times is linear.
>
> Similarly, sensors can consist of either a conduit, node, pump, weir, orifice or time element.

> Real-Time control consists of two components, the real-time control element and one or more sensors used to control this element. All control elements have an input rate of change between minimum and maximum operating values. When the combined sensors condition changes from false to rue (on) the control will ramp from its current value towards the minimum value over the specified ramp time. When the combined sensor condition then changes from true to false (off) will ramp from the minimum value towards the maximum value. Each control element also has a time period over which the real-time control applies. This is between Time Start and Time End.

> The Parameter may be subject to either the absolute minimum and/or maximum values or to a percentage of the input maximum value at the commencement of the simulation or the ongoing calculated maximum value, depending on the situation.

> The link being subjected to RTC control is la5, the parameter being controlled is flow and the RTC control starts at 2:30am and ends at 8:00am. The RTC control takes 5 minutes to turn on (minimize) and 2 minutes to turn off (maximize). The minimum flow is 10% of the flow at the time step with the RTC condition changing from false to true. The maximum flow is 100% of the flow at commencement of last false to true change.

> So, if the water elevation at mh a1 is \>= 132.5 AND the water depth at mh b1 is \>= 2.8 and the time is between 2:30am and 8:00am then the flow in link la5 will be restricted to 10% of its calculated value at the time step when the RTC control condition changes to true.

SECTION 17: REAL TIME CONTROL

> ***Mh a5***

xpswmm Reference Manual

After time 2:30am the RTC control commences operation. At that time the Levels at mh a1 and mh a5 are already above the test levels. The conduit la 5 reduces from its current flow rate to 10 % thereof over a ramp period of 5 minutes. (from 114 m<sup>3</sup>/s down to 14.5 m<sup>3</sup>/s). At 3:10am the level at mh a1 goes below 132.5. so the flow rate commences back up towards its original value of 114m<sup>3</sup>/s over a two (2) minute ramp time to 3:12am.

Between 3:12am and 3:14am the high and low flow peaks over two time steps is simply a reflection of the built up head at node mh a5.

After clearing this head difference between the upstream and downstream ends of link la 5 by 3:14am the flow then remains at 100% of natural flow to the end of simulation as mh a1 and mh a5 remain below the set elevation of 132.5 and depth of 2.8 respectively.

> ***PLEASE NOTE**: When using flow as a percentage it is important to only commence the RTC control after the flow has reached the amount from which you want to it reduced.*

**17.4.2 RTC Directly using Diameter as the Control Parameter**

The following example uses RTCdia.xp

838

SECTION 17: REAL TIME CONTROL

Water level limits at node02, node04 and node06 are set to H2, H4 and H6 respectively.

Gate 01 that is normally closed will be released if the water depth in node02 goes above H2

Gate 02 that is normally closed will be released if the water depth in node04 goes above H4

Both Gate 01 and Gate 02 will only remain open when the water elevation at node 06 is also below H6

For this example H2 is set to a water depth of 2.00, H2 is also set to a water depth of 2.00 and H6 is set to a water elevation of 0.75.

The following four dialogs provide all the data to describe the operation of RTC controls Gate-01 and Gate-02 with their respective sensors node02 - node 06 and node 04 - node 06.

After the first time steep of the simulation H2 is less than (\<) 0.5 depth and H5 is less than (\<) 2.0 elevation. Consequently the pump speed over 6 seconds ramps down to zero (0.0).

At time 13 minutes H2 \>= 0.5 depth and H5 still \< 2.0 elevation, so pump speed ramps from zero to 100.0 percent (%) of original value of 1.0 (i.e. pump turns on to maximum).

Between 13 and 21 minutes the pump speed alternates from zero 0% immediately after H5 \> 2.0 elevation and back to 100% pump speed when H5 \< 2.0 elevation. Note the pump speed is applied to the defined pump curve. Ramp on and off time is set at 6 seconds (0.1 minutes).

After 21 minutes the pump works at 100% pump curve speed to the end of simulation as H5 is always \< 2.0, while H2 \> 0.5 depth.

It should be noted that the actual head at H5 between 13 and 21 minutes oscillates around elevation 2.0 and in fact goes as high as 2.6. This is caused by the delayed head build up during the ramping times. This is common to control devices that do not instantaneously turn on and off and propagate surges to adjacent nodes. PID control technologies are often applied to control or optimize these oscillations. In practical terms some over-shoot in control level needs to be taken into consideration. The ramp times for on to off and off to on can play a significant role in the oscillation magnitude.

It is also important to have a smaller simulation time step than the ramp period.

>

**Data Requirements**

The minimum data requirements for setting up a 2D/1D hydraulic model are:

1.  A DTM with sufficient resolution and accuracy to depict the topography of all flowpaths and storage areas in the 2D domain(s). The vertical accuracy depends on the modeling objectives and budget constraints. However, for large scale models ± 0.2m is preferred, whilst for fine-scale urban models \< ± 0.1m is recommended. The vertical accuracy is dependent on the typical depths of inundation in key areas.

2.  Cross-sections for any 1D flowpaths.

3.  If bed resistance varies over the model, geo-corrected aerial photography or other GIS layer from which material (land-use) zones are digitized for setting Manning’s n values.

4.  Boundary conditions (e.g. ocean water levels, catchment inflows, rainfall, evaporation, etc).

5.  Calibration data locations as points in a GIS layer. Peak levels should be attached as attributes to the calibration points.

6.  Surveys of key hydraulic controls such as levees / embankments (3D breaklines), culverts, bridges, etc.

**1D Network Definition**

1D link-node networks are developed in xpswmm with the graphic toolset**.** Alternatively, a 1D network may be imported or dynamically linked to an external database.

The adequacy of the 1D domains is primarily dependent on the network representation adopted. In general, the finer the resolution the more accurate the model, but the longer the computing time. For stability reasons, the timestep for

> 855

xpswmm Reference Manual

computation is normally controlled by the minimum channel length. The end result may require a compromise between the level of detail and the computational effort.

Different timesteps can be specified for 1D and 2D domains largely removing this constraint.

The first step in setting up a model is to define the flow patterns and to use each identified flow path as the basis for a channel of the network. Following this step the flow paths are linked at junctions, or nodes, and each node is considered as a storage element, which accepts the flow from the adjoining channels. In this way, the model is built up as a series of interconnected channels and nodes with the channels representing the flow resistance characteristics.

For compatibility with the mathematical assumptions, the channels would ideally have more or less uniform cross-sections with constant bottom slope and a minimum of longitudinal curvature. In practice this requirement cannot always be met, particularly where a fine resolution of detail is not required in a portion of the study area. In this case, a flow path is represented by an “equivalent” channel. Experience has indicated that in most cases an adequate calibration can be achieved by deriving a single channel equivalent to a number of series or parallel channels using the steady state Manning's relation for deriving the equivalent channel characteristics.

All nodes and channels are labeled with an ID. No two nodes or two channels can have the same ID. A node and a channel cannot have the same ID.

**2D Cell Size**

The cell sizes of 2D domains need to be sufficiently small to reproduce the hydraulic behavior. In xpswmm2D, all cells are square and the same size with a defined orientation. The cells are defined and edited with the 2D Area Extent tool in the Layer Control Panel.

**2D Topography**

2D domains are created by building them through a series of layers using the Layer Control Panel**.** The layers may be constructed using xpswmm’s graphic tools**,** imported or dynamically linked to a number of database formats. These layers contain or access from other files information on the size and orientation of the grid, bed/ground elevations, bed material type or flow resistance value, and other data.

A 2D domain is automatically discretised as a grid of square cells. Each cell is given characteristics relating to the topography such as ground/bathymetry elevation, bed resistance value and initial water level, etc.

**Recommended Boundary Conditions Arrangements**

Hydraulic models typically have water level boundaries at the downstream end and flow boundaries at the upstream ends.

For tidal models, the only boundaries may be ocean water level boundaries with pre-defined flows into or out of the system. For flood models, there are major flows into the upstream boundaries representing the catchment runoff. Occasionally, an upstream water level boundary is used in the absence of reliable river flow estimates. Where the downstream boundary is not at a well-defined water level (e.g. ocean), a stage-discharge relationship may be specified. In some situations, a hydraulic structure that is inlet controlled acts as the downstream control, in which case, the water level specified downstream of the structure has no influence on the results.

For 2D domains, water level boundaries exhibit the greatest stability (Syme 1991). Flow or velocity boundaries are difficult to specify as the flow direction and distribution across the boundary needs to be defined by the user. Wetting and drying of flow boundaries is also prone to instabilities.

Specifying boundaries oblique to the grid (i.e. not parallel to the grid axes or not at 45° to the axes) is also difficult in 2D fixed grid domains. However, xpswmm2D has an oblique boundary method that stabilizes water level boundaries. This facility is by default on, but can be adjusted using Oblique Boundary Method. For details of the method see Syme 1991.

The recommended approach for 2D flow boundaries is to dynamically link a 1D node to a 1D/2D interface boundary and apply the flow to the 1D node (Syme 1991). The inflow to the 1D node, generates a flow into the 2D domain across the 1D/2D interface boundary. This combination benefits from the stability, wetting and drying performance and the oblique boundary flexibility of water level boundaries. The velocity distribution and direction across the 1D/2D interface boundary is automatically determined by the flow regime that develops in the 2D domain.

2D boundary conditions line along the edge of 2D active areas jus as outfalls are connected to the end of a 1D network. When creating boundaries, use the snap tool so that the polyline coincides with the vertices of the active polygons.

**Calibration and Sensitivity**

Models are usually calibrated against known flood or tidal conditions with the bed resistance coefficient (eg. Manning’s n) adjusted until calculated water levels and flows are consistent with recorded field measurements. Where there is poor or insufficient topographic data the calibration procedure may also involve adjustments to the model topography to provide an adequate representation of the recorded flow behavior. This is more common in 1D domains (where there is a choice of cross-sections to define a flowpath). There is usually little opportunity to adjust topography (from that surveyed) in 2D domains.

> 856

SECTION 18: 2D Hydraulic Modeling

> Ideally, the model would be calibrated for conditions similar to those under investigation although this is not always possible, particularly when major floods are being considered. In these situations, a sensitivity analyses maybe carried out by increasing and decreasing calibration factors such as Manning’s n.
>
> **Limitations and Recommendations**
>
> xpswmm/xpstorm 2D is designed to model free-surface flow in coastal waters, estuaries, rivers, creeks, floodplains and urban drainage systems. Flow regimes through structures are handled by adaptation of the 1D St Venant Equations and the 2D Shallow Water Equations using standard structure equations. Supercritical flow areas can be represented.
>
> Limitations and recommendations to note are:

1.  In areas of super-critical flow through the 2D and 1D domains, the results should be treated with caution, particularly if they are in key areas of interest. Hydraulic jumps and surcharging against obstructions may occur in reality – these highly 3D localized effects are not modeled.

2.  Where the 2D cell size is less than the water depth, the Smagorinsky viscosity formulation is preferred over the default constant viscosity formulation to model sub-cell turbulence (Barton 2001). It is always good practice to carry out sensitivity tests to ascertain the importance of the viscosity coefficient and formulation.

3.  Caution should be used when using 2D cell sizes less than 2m, particularly when the flow depth exceeds the cell width (Barton 2001).

4.  Modelling of hydraulic structures should always be cross-checked with desktop calculations or other software, especially if calibration data is unavailable. All 1D and 2D schemes are only an approximation to the complex flows that can occur through a structure, and regardless of the software used should be checked for their performance (Syme 1998, Syme 2001).

5.  There is no momentum transfer between 1D and 2D connections. Although in most situations this is not of concern, it does influence results where a large structure (relative to the 2D cell size) is modelled as a 1D element.

6.  There is a practical limit to the ultimate density of the 2D grid domain – in the current version 2 million grid cells is the upper range of the total cell count limit which is recommended. This is principally due to the very large 2D results files (\*.dat files) which can be created when solving a model with this number of cells. In general, there can be issues with attempting to manipulate (open/close, read/write... ect) individual files upwards or greater than 2GB in size. If a large number of grid cells is required for your project and very large results files are being written (over 2GB files) then adjusting the output interval of the 2D results within the 2D job control is one way to reduce the output file sizes. Further, if a given 2D grid domain is needed to be very large (2 million grid cells or more) inorder to accommodate a required grid resolution as well as the grid coverage area, using multiple 2D domains may provide flexibility to use different 2D grid domains with different grid resolutions in different areas in the model. This can allow for the total number of grids in the model to be significantly reduced.

However, 2D schemes do not model losses in the vertical or fine-scale horizontal effects (such as around a bridge pier) and, therefore, may require the introduction of additional form losses.

Their connections and boundary conditions can be further described using the tools within the interface. The model must be integrated with a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) to provide elevation vaules to the modeling objects. Topographic layers are used to further define 2D flow properties. Topographic layers such as Fill Areas, Dynamic Elevation Shapes, and Elevation Shapes have global adjustments available in version 2013 and later. Double-clicking on the object opens a dialog in which a change can be made. This change can then be applied to the selected object, all selected objects, or all objects of that type.

> The 2D model topography is defined by elevations at the cell centers, mid sides and corners. Each cell has the following elevations assigned to it:

- “C” Zpt (ZC) – middle of cell

- “U” Zpt (ZU) – middle right of cell

- “V” Zpt (ZV) – middle top of cell

- “H” Zpt (ZH) – top right hand corner of cell

> The precision of the cell center elevations can be set from 0 to 10 within the Grid Extent Properties dialog in version 2013 and beyond. The typical precision is 2 for US Customary projects and 3 for Metric models.
>
> One of most important aspects of xp2D modeling is to understand the roles of the elevation points. The ZC point:

- defines the volume of active water (cell volume is based on a flat square cell that wets and dries at a height of ZC);

- controls when a cell becomes wet and dry (note that cell sides can also wet and dry); and

- is used to determine the bed slope when testing for the upstream controlled flow regime

> The ZU and ZV points control how water is conveyed from one cell to another. If the cell has dried (based on the ZC point) the four ZU and ZV points on the cell sides are deactivated. ZU and ZV points also wet and dry independently of the cell wetting or drying.

Each 2D domain is a rectangle at any orientation. The orientation and dimensions are defined using the 2D Area Extent dialog. For the orientation it is recommended that the X-axis falls between 90° and –90° of East as it is preferable to view the 2D grid within this range and some post-processing software only operate within this range.

Several options are available for setting the grid location and orientation via an imported file. The options are:

- Using a four-sided polygon in a GIS layer to define the 2D grid orientation and dimensions.

- Using a line (two vertices only) in a GIS layer to define the orientation of the X-axis (see Read MI Location), and Grid Size (N,M) or Grid Size (X,Y) to set the 2D grid X and Y dimensions.

- Using Origin, Orientation or Orientation Angle, and Grid Size (N,M) or Grid Size (X,Y). No GIS layers are required for this option.

It is not essential at any point to specify dimensions that are an exact multiple of Cell Size.

**1D Boundary Conditions**

Boundary conditions for the 1D link-node network are defined in the Hydraulics Node dialog. Boundary conditions may include:

> xpswmm Reference Manual
>
> Initial water levels
>
> Constant or time variant inflow
>
> Tailwater (several options)
>
> **2D Boundary Condition Layers**
>
> 2D domain boundary conditions, including links and interfaces to both 1D and additional 2D domains, are defined using one or more 2D Boundary Condition GIS layers. Fixed field text inputs are also supported for backward compatibility. The different types of boundaries and links are described in the table.
>
> The GIS layers may contain points, lines, polylines and regions, noting that for regions only the centroid is used. Each object has several attributes as described in table below.

> **Eddy Viscosity**
>
> Two options exist for specifying eddy viscosity for the 2D domains to approximate the effect of small-scale motions that cannot be modelled directly. Enter data using the Viscosity dialog in the 2D Job Control settings.

- The first method is to supply a constant value, E, which is used throughout the model. This is generally satisfactory when the cell size is much greater than the depth or when other terms are dominant (e.g. high bed resistance).

- The second method (Viscosity Formulation == **Smagorinsky**) is an approximation to the Smagorinsky formulation. This formulation is preferred where the cell size is similar or less than the depth.

> Testing by Barton 2001 indicates that 2D schemes using very fine elements (less than 2m) may have difficulty predicting correct flow behavior. Results from models with less than 2m cell size should be treated with caution, particularly if the depths are greater than the cell size and/or the friction forces are low (i.e. low Manning’s n).
>
> **How to Model Bridges and Box Culverts**
>
> Bridges, box culverts and other structures that constrict flow can be modeled in 2D rather than using 1D elements provided the flow width of the structure is of similar or larger size than the 2D cell size. Cells are modified in their height (invert and obvert) and width. For bridges, additional losses associated with flow reaching the underside of the deck is specified. For box culverts, the additional resistance for vertical walls is specified. Additional form losses (energy head losses) can be specified for all FCs.
>
> Weir flow (across levees and other embankments) is modeled in 2D domains by default, but can be changed using options in the Free Overfall command. Weirs may also be modeled using 1D elements.
>
> Modeling hydraulic structures in 2D domains must be carried out with a good understanding of the limitations of different approaches and the different flow regimes possible. The modeler must understand why and where the energy losses occur when assigning form losses to a 2D cell or contraction and expansion losses to a 1D element (Syme 2001b).
>
> It is important to note that contraction and expansion losses associated with structures are modeled very differently in 1D and 2D schemes. 1D schemes rely on applying form loss coefficients, as they cannot simulate the horizontal or vertical changes in velocity direction and speed. 2D schemes model these horizontal changes and, therefore, do not require the introduction of form losses to the same extent as that required for 1D schemes. However, 2D schemes do not model losses in the vertical or fine-scale horizontal effects (such as around a bridge pier) and, therefore, may require the introduction of additional form losses. See Syme 2001 for further details.
>
> It is strongly recommended that the losses through a structure be validated through:

- Calibration to recorded information (if available).

- Crosschecked using desktop calculations based on theory and/or standard publications (e.g. Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways, US FHA 1973).

- Crosschecked with results using other hydraulic software.  
  > To validate structure flows and energy losses:

- Specify time-series output (PO) lines of flow (Q\_) and flow area (QA) across the structure. Upstream and downstream water levels may also be specified or taken from the map (SMS) output.

- Using the upstream and downstream water levels, determine whether flow is upstream or downstream controlled and estimate the flow using theoretical equations or other method.

- Using publications such as Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways (US FHA 1973), determine the energy loss coefficient and compare this with the total energy loss calculated in the model. The total energy loss () is the upstream head minus the downstream head divided by the dynamic head based on the depth and width averaged velocity () (i.e. Q\_/QA) as given below. Clearly, any energy losses associated with bed resistance (e.g. Manning’s equation) need to be allowed for by taking this amount out of the term.

- Using other software (eg. HEC-RAS) create a check model using the flow and downstream water level as boundaries and compare the calculated upstream water levels.

> **1D Approach -** Preferred approach where the total structure width is less than the cell size.
>
> Entry and/or exit losses may need to be reduced where the structure width is significant compared with the cell size (Syme 2001b).
>
> Momentum is not transferred into or out of the 1D element from the 2D domain. “Suppressed” flow patterns in the 2D domain occur at the structure outlet when using 1D elements, especially if the structure width is significant compared with the cell size. The water tends to spread out evenly, rather than jet out as occurs if using a 2D representation. This may be overcome by applying “wing walls” in the 2D domain at the structure outlet by assigning flood free elevations to the ZU and ZV Zpts either side of where the 1D element discharges into the 2D domain.
>
> **2D Approach -** Preferred where the total structure width is greater than the cell size. The flow area must be adequately represented by the 2D Zpts and any adjustments to cell widths. The head drop across the structure during different flow regimes should be validated against other methods and/or literature.
>
> Some additional form losses are normally required to achieve correct head drop (see Syme 2001b). Where the cell size is less than the depth, use the Smagorinsky Viscosity formulation. Care should be exercised using cell sizes less than 2m (Barton 2001).
>
> Momentum is transferred through the structure, providing far more realistic flow patterns than using a 1D element.
>
> **2D Upstream Controlled Flow (Weirs and Supercritical Flow)**
>
> Where flow in the 2D domain becomes upstream controlled, xp automatically switches between either weir flow and/or upstream controlled friction flow.
>
> If Supercritical is set to ON the following rules apply. Note: the bed slope at ZU and ZV points is determined as the slope from the **upstream ZC** point to the ZU or ZV point in the direction of **positive** flow.

- Where the bed slope at a ZU or ZV point is in the same direction as the water surface slope, tests are carried out to determine whether the flow is upstream controlled or downstream controlled. The adopted flow regime is determined by comparing the upstream and downstream controlled regime flows (preference to the lower flow) and whether the Froude No exceeds 1 (unless changed by Froude Check). The equation used for upstream controlled flow is the Manning equation with the water surface slope set to the bed slope. The Froude It is recommended that the Froude No check be used (which is the default setting) as it provides more accurate switching. A further check that phases out the Froude Check as the water surface approaches the horizontal (otherwise in some situations, the flow would remain in the upstream controlled regime). This check can be disabled for backward compatibility using Froude Depth Adjustment.

- Weir flow only occurs if the bed slope is adverse (different direction) to the water surface slope. Weir flow across 2D cell sides is modeled by first testing whether the flow is upstream or downstream controlled. If upstream controlled, the broad-crested weir flow equation is used to replace the calculations for downstream controlled (sub-critical) flow conditions. Weir flow maybe switched off using the Free Overfall options.

> xp produces an increase in water level at transitions from supercritical flow to subcritical flow as occurs with a hydraulic jump. It does not, however, model the complex 3D flow patterns that occur at a hydraulic jump, as it uses a 2D horizontal plane solution. Results in areas of transition should be interpreted with caution. It is also important to be careful presenting results in areas of supercritical flow as complex flows (such as surcharging against a house) may occur that would yield higher localised water levels – it is good practice to also view the energy levels when providing advice on flood planning levels.
>
> If Supercritical is set to OFF, and Free Overfall is set to ON (the default), weir flow may occur on both adverse and normal bed slopes.
>
> The weir flow switch may be varied spatially over the grid by setting a weir factor of zero where there is to be no automatic weir flow. The weir factor also allows calibration or adjustment where the broad-crested weir equation is applied. The broad-crested weir equation is divided by the weir factor. Therefore, a factor of 1.0 represents no adjustment, while a factor greater than one will decrease the flow efficiency. Note: the weir factor is not the broad-crested weir coefficient. For further information, refer to Syme 2001b.

> The selection of the timestep is critically important for the success of a model. The run time is directly proportional to the number of timesteps required to calculate model behavior for the required time period, while the computations may become unstable and meaningless if the timestep is greater than a limiting value. This is known as the Courant stability criterion.

> **2D Domains**

> For the 2D scheme, the Courant Number generally needs to be less than 10 and is typically around 5 for most real-world applications (Syme 1991). The computation timestep in the Job Control settings and should be set in accordance with this criterion as given in the equation below.
>
> <img src="./media/image648.png" style="width:2.95625in;height:2.43333in" />
>
> As a rule, the timestep is typically half the cell size. For steep models with high Froude numbers and supercritical flow, smaller timesteps may be required. It is strongly advised to not simply reduce the timestep if the model is unstable, but rather to establish why it is unstable and, in most instances, adjust the model topography, initial conditions or boundary conditions to remove the instability.
>
> If the model is operating at high Courant numbers (\>10), sensitivity testing with smaller timesteps to demonstrate no measurable change in results should be carried out.
>
> The occurrence of high mass errors is also an indicator of using too high a timestep.

An “ERROR” keyword indicates an unrecoverable error and causes the simulation to stop. As many errors as possible are trapped before stopping.
>
> An “XY:” at the beginning of a line indicates the error, warning, check or other message has also been redirected to a .mif file. Opening the .mif file in the GIS often provides a far more rapid location of the message within the model domain(s) than via other ways.

> **Check Files**
>
> xp produces check files for quality control of a model’s input data. It is strongly recommended that models are quality controlled through reviews of the check files.

> **Time-Series Output**
>
> Time series data output is available in the following forms:

- \_PO.csv and \_LP\< name\>.csv files (also referred to as plot output (PO) or longitudinal profile (LP) data) created using 2d_po and 2d_lp layers). These files are typically used in spreadsheet software for graphing and analysing time-series results.

- In the \_TS.mif file (2d_po locations only). The \_TS.mif file also contains all 1D time based output. This file is used for graphing time series output within a GIS.

> Use Model Output in the 2D Job Control Settings to control the output times.
>
> **Identifying the Start of an Instability**
>
> Instabilities usually start with a one or a few computational points “bouncing” as a result of poor convergence of the mathematical equations being solved. To help identify the start of an instability, negative depth warnings are issued if the depth in a 2D cell or a 1D node becomes falls below –0.1m. Negative depth warnings are usually a pre-cursor to an instability. It is not uncommon, particularly in areas of rapid wetting and drying for negative depths to occur before the computational point is made dry (inactive). Hence a buffer of – 0.1m is used before reporting a WARNING.
>
> The WARNINGs are sent to the \_messages.mif file. Bring these into your GIS and they point directly at the location of the negative depth. If the number of these warnings are substantial (eg. if a model remains stable but with minor instabilities), select some of the first negative depth warnings in the attribute data (Browser Window in MapInfo) and display just those. The warnings are in order of occurrence. By tracing through the negative depth warnings in the vicinity of the instability, the trigger point of the instability can often be located.
>
> **Mass Balance Output**
>
> Mass balance information is generated by checking the box in the Model Output in the 2D Job Control Settings***.*** The cumulative mass error (CE) appears at the far right of the display lines on the DOS Window for each timestep displayed to the screen. A \_MB.csv file is also created in the results folder. The file contains information at each display time on the inflows and outflows, volume, predicted volume error and the mass and cumulative mass errors as a percentage, for all 2D domains and each individual 2D domain.
>
> The mass error values are based on dividing the estimated volume error by the average inflow/outflow through the domains. At the startup of a model, particularly when there is little or no flow, and or the model rapidly becomes wet, the cumulative mass error can appear high, however, this should drop away as the model “settles” down. The mass error is displayed as zero while there is less than 1m<sup>3</sup>/s of water moving through the model.
>
> The majority of models should fall within +/-1% cumulative mass error. If a model experiences higher mass errors this maybe due to using too large a timestep and/or areas of the model are sensitive or slightly unstable. Models with significant areas of complex, steep flows and/or rapid wetting and drying usually experience higher mass errors than those with predominantly more benign, sub-critical flows.
>
> Note that the estimation of mass errors is in itself a prediction and has errors associated with the estimation process. It is also recommended that conventional mass balance checks be carried out to cross-check.
>
> **.wor File**
>
> This file is a MapInfo workspace and is created for every simulation. It is named XXX.wor (XXX = xp project name) and is written to the project folder. The workspace contains all GIS layers used as input to the simulation, and is an excellent way of ascertaining which GIS layers were used to set up a model, particularly large models with many GIS inputs.
>
> The .wor file when opened in MapInfo simply opens the .tab layers. No Map or Browser windows are automatically opened. The file may also be viewed in a text editor.
>
> **2D Errors - The messages.mif File**
>
> The polygons and connectors created may have violated some of the required conditions for 2D modeling. In this case the 2D model may not run and become unstable. The messages and other information are written to a file called
