PREFACE

> The field of hydrology is of fundamental importance to civil and
> environ- mental engineers, hydrogeologists, and other earth scientists
> because of the environmental significance of water supply, major
> floods and droughts and their management, drainage and urban
> stormwater issues, floodplain man- agement, and water quality impacts.
> In recent years, hurricanes and storm surge have caused significant
> urban disasters, especially along coastal areas where urban
> development has expanded rapidly. This text was written to address the
> computational emphasis of modern hydrology at an undergrad- uate or
> graduate level, and to provide a balanced approach to important
> applications in hydrologic engineering and science.
>
> Increasing use and sophistication of personal computers has
> revolutionized the daily practice of hydrology. The Internet has
> revolutionized the accessibil- ity of hydrologic data and computer
> models. The impact of transferring online data from governmental and
> scientific sources to the practicing hydrologist or student has been
> phenomenal. Hydrologic data, digital terrain models, and mapping
> software linked with hydrologic modeling have allowed complex problems
> to be solved. Geographical information systems (GIS) and radar
> rainfall have greatly improved our ability to predict hydrologic
> response using distributed information. A number of major improvements
> have been made to existing hydrologic models, such as HEC and SWMM,
> and advances in distributed hydrologic modeling such as Vflo. A list
> of important websites and links currently used routinely in hydrology
> is contained in Appendix E and can be found at the textbook website:

> **THE EVOLUTION OF HYDROLOGY**

-   **Chapter 1:** Extensive updates and changes, and completely rewrit-
    ten with a more introductory coverage of topics, including simple
    rainfall runoff and hydrograph analysis with new examples and
    completely revised homework problems.

-   **Chapter 2:** Coverage of the unit hydrograph and includes hydro-
    logic losses such as evaporation and infiltration. New examples have
    been added on Green and Ampt infiltration, as well as many
    additional homework problems.

-   **Chapter 4:** Expanded coverage and new examples on flood routing.
    Many of the older numerical schemes have been simplified or removed,
    and new homework problems have been added to stream- line the
    chapter.

-   **Chapter 5:** Presents updated methods for simulating rainfall and
    runoff, flood hydrograph prediction, and flood control options in a

> watershed. New models are highlighted with new examples and a new
> detailed case study, including flood control alternatives. All new
> homework problems have been written as well.

-   **Chapter 10:** Describes the application of GIS and geospatial
    > infor- mation in hydrologic analysis and formulation of hydrologic
    > models. An updated list of available GIS and related software is
    > provided.

-   **Chapter 11:** Major advances in detecting accurate and representa-
    > tive rainfall with radar and rain gages are presented. The
    > applica- tion of radar rainfall as distributed model input is
    > described. Details on distributed hydrologic modeling are
    > presented for a case study, for which sample datasets are
    > available in Appendix E.

-   **Chapter 12:** Reviews the new emerging trends in flood control
    > methods and floodplain management, a vital topic given the recent
    > storm events in the United States, such as Hurricane Irene in the
    > northeast. A detailed discussion of massive hurricane impacts
    > along the Gulf Coast, including Hurricane Katrina and Ike, two of
    > the most damaging hurricanes in history.

-   **Chapter 13:** Brand new and includes emphasis on the San Antonio
    > River and Edwards Aquifer System in Central Texas, the Colorado
    > River Basin system, and the Thames River in England. The chapter
    > also briefly highlights international water issues in China and
    > South- east Asia. The chapter ends with a discussion of the
    > changing global condition and the need for sustainable interaction
    > between human and natural systems.

> **ORGANIZATION OF THE 5TH EDITION**
>
> The 5th edition of the text is divided into three main sections. The
> first sec- tion, consisting of the first four chapters, covers
> traditional topics in hydrol- ogy related to the water balance such
> as: (1) hydrologic principles, hydrologic cycle, and measurement
> techniques, (2) hydrologic analysis using hydrographs for
> rainfall-runoff, (3) statistical and flood frequency analysis, and (4)
> hydrologic and hydraulic flood routing methods. The sec- ond major
> section, Chapters 5 through 9, is designed to apply hydrologic theory
> and available hydrologic modeling techniques to several areas of
> engineering hydrology and design: watershed analysis, floodplain
> delinea- tion, ground water, and urban stormwater. The latest methods
> and com- puter models are emphasized in enough detail for practical
> use, and updated examples and new case studies are provided.
>
> Chapter 5 on Hydrologic Simulation Models has been completely redone
> and updated to include the latest model versions as highlighted below
> in the next section. Chapter 6, Urban Hydrology, presents methods and
> reviews available computer models for pipe and open channel storm
> drainage systems. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) is
> highlighted as the most comprehensive urban runoff model available
> today. Chapter 7, Floodplain Hydraulics, first reviews concepts from
> open channel flow and includes uni- form flow and critical flow
> coverage, as required to understand water surface
>
> profile computations. The HEC-RAS model is described in detail with a
> case study demonstrating the power of the model to evaluate natural
> floodplains. Chapter 8 presents ground water hydrology as a
> stand-alone chapter, including flow in porous media, aquifer
> properties, well mechanics, and computer appli- cations. Governing
> equations of flow are derived and applied to a number of ground water
> problems, including both steady-state and transient analyses. Chapter
> 9, written by James Thompson, is a comprehensive chapter on design
> applications in hydrology. It addresses design rainfall, small
> watershed design, hydraulic design, detention pond design, detailed
> culvert design, and flood- plain mitigation design issues. It is one
> of the most comprehensive design chap- ters ever written and presents
> both the theory and method behind modern hydrologic and hydraulic
> design techniques.
>
> In the final section of the 5th edition, three chapters (10, 11, 12)
> guide the user to the next generation of hydrologic computation,
> watershed eval- uation, and discussion of important severe storm
> impacts and flood man- agement. No other textbook presents this type
> of material all in one place. Chapter 13, a new chapter for the 5th
> edition, presents details of major water resource projects around the
> world.
>
> Chapter 10 presents the use of geographic information systems (GIS)
> and digital elevation models (DEMs) as important tools for watershed
> analysis, hydrologic modeling, and modern floodplain delineation. Many
> useful hydrologic datasets and software are now widely available in
> high- resolution digital form on the web (see Appendix E). Chapter 11
> depicts some of the latest technology on the use of NEXRAD radar data
> to esti- mate rainfall intensities over watershed areas. Radar
> rainfall has greatly improved our ability to predict rainfall patterns
> over a watershed and offers real advantages for hydrologic flood alert
> systems. Distributed hydrologic modeling is introduced that
> capitalizes on advances in radar rainfall detection.

The 5th edition of the text should provide the engineering or science
stu- dent with all the necessary theory to understand principles of
hydrology, hydrologic modeling, floodplain hydraulics and analysis, and
water resources in the modern digital world. The student or practicing
engineer should find the book a useful reference for hydrologic methods,
current models, design examples, and extensively documented case
studies. In addition, simple calculations and spreadsheet examples are
utilized and highlighted in numerous places in the 5th edition, which
contains over 80 worked examples, over 220 homework problems, and 6
major case studies.

> The World Wide Web offers many opportunities for access to regional
> data with minimal cost and effort (see Appendix E), but the U.S.
> Geological Survey, National Weather Service, National Resources
> Conservation Service,
>
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other state and local agencies
> should be emphasized for students as likely sources of regional
> hydrologic data.
>
> The text includes a Companion website *hydrology.rice.edu* where
> updates and information can be found regarding the 5th edition. Dr.
> Bedi- ent maintains the site that contains selected problems, example
> datasets,
>
> **AUDIENCE AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES**
>
> simple Excel programs, and dozens of PowerPoint presentations that are
> available to any instructors and students in the course at no charge.
> These resources are designed to improve the teaching of a hydrology
> course at either the undergraduate or graduate level. A detailed
> solutions manual with updated problems is available for the 5th
> edition. The solutions man- ual for the International Edition can be

> **INTRODUCTION TO HYDROLOGY**

**15**

> The **hydrologic cycle** is a continuous process in which water is
> evapo- rated from water surfaces and the oceans, moves inland as moist
> air masses, and produces precipitation if the correct vertical lifting
> conditions exist. The precipitation that falls from clouds onto the
> land surface of the earth is dis- persed to the hydrologic cycle via
> several pathways (Fig. 1--1). A portion of the **precipitation** *P*,
> or rainfall, is retained on the soil near where it falls and returns
> to the atmosphere via **evaporation** *E*, the conversion of water to
> water vapor from a water surface, and **transpiration** *T*, the loss
> of water vapor through plant tissue and leaves. The combined loss,
> called **evapotrans- piration** *ET*, is a maximum value if the water
> supply in the soil is adequate at all times. These parameters are
> further discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter and Section
> 2.6.
>
> Some water enters the soil system as **infiltration** *F*, which is a
> function of soil moisture conditions and soil type, and may reenter
> channels later as interflow or may percolate to recharge the shallow
> ground water. **Ground water** *G* flows in porous media in the
> subsurface in either shallow or deeper aquifer systems that can be
> pumped for water supply to agricultural and municipal water systems
> (see Chapter 8).
>
> The remaining portion of precipitation becomes overland flow or
> **direct runoff** *R*, which flows generally in a down-gradient
> direction to accu- mulate in local streams that then flow to rivers.
> Hydrologic analysis to deter- mine runoff response from a watershed
> area is covered in Chapter 2. Evaporation and infiltration are both
> complex losses from input rainfall and are difficult to measure or
> compute from theoretical methods, covered in detail in Sections 2.6,
> 2.7, and 2.8.

> Surface and ground waters flow from higher elevations toward lower
> elevations and may eventually discharge into the ocean, especially
> after large rainfall events (Fig. 1--1a). However, large quantities of
> surface water and portions of ground water return to the atmosphere by
> evaporation or *ET*, thus completing the natural hydrologic cycle
> (Fig. 1--1b). Precipitation from the atmosphere is a major force that
> drives the hydrologic cycle, and under- standing major weather

> **Ancient History**
>
> Biswas (1972), in a concise treatment of the history of hydrology,
> describes the early water management practices of the Sumerians and
> Egyptians in the Middle East and the Chinese along the banks of the
> Huang He (Yellow River). Archeological evidence exists for hydraulic
> structures that were built for irrigation and other water control
> activities. A dam was built across the Nile about 4000
> [b]{.smallcaps}.c., and later a canal for fresh water was constructed
> between Cairo and Suez.
>
> The Greek philosophers were the first serious students of hydrology,
> with Aristotle proposing the conversion of moist air into water deep
> inside mountains as the source of springs and streams. Homer suggested
> the idea

> of an underground sea as the source of all surface waters. The Romans
> con- structed numerous aqueducts to serve large cities as well as
> small towns and industrial sites. The Romans had the largest
> collection with water being sup- plied by 11 aqueducts constructed
> over a period of about 500 years. Figure 1--2 shows one of the famous
> aqueducts built in France during that early period. They served
> potable water and supplied the numerous baths and fountains in the
> city, as well as finally being emptied into the sewers, where the
> once-used gray water performed their last function in removing wastes.
> The construction of the Roman aqueducts is considered one of the most
> important engineering feats in history.
>
> Streamflow measurement techniques were first attempted in the water
> systems of Rome (a.d. 97) based on the cross-sectional area of flow.
> It remained for Leonardo da Vinci to discover the proper relationship
> between area, velocity, and flow rate during the Italian Renaissance.
> The first recorded measurement of rainfall and surface flow was made
> in the seven- teenth century by Perrault. He compared measured
> rainfall to the estimated flow of the Seine River to show the two were
> related. Perrault's findings were published in 1694. Halley, the
> English astronomer (1656--1742), used a small pan to estimate
> evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea and con- cluded that it was
> enough to account for tributary flows. Mariotte gaged the velocity of
> flow in the Seine River in Paris. These early beginnings of the
> science of hydrology provided the foundation for numerous advances in
> the eighteenth century, including Bernoulli's theorem, the Pitot tube
> for measur- ing velocity, and the Chezy (1769) formula, which form the
> basis for modern hydraulics and fluid measurement.
>
> During the nineteenth century, significant advances in ground water
> hydrology and hydraulics occurred. Darcy's law for flow in porous
> media was a major advance, as well as the Dupuit--Thiem well flow
> formula (Chapter 8). In addition, the Hagen--Poiseuille capillary flow
> equation was developed to describe flow in small channels. The
> Darcy-Weisbach equa- tion for pipe flow was also developed during this
> same period in the 1850s. In surface water hydrology, many flow
> formulas and measuring instruments
>
> were developed that allowed for the beginning of systematic stream
> gaging. In 1867, discharge measurements were organized on the Rhine
> River at Basel and quickly expanded throughout Europe.
>
> The U.S. Geological Survey set up the first systematic program of flow
> measurement in the United States on the Mississippi in 1888. During
> this same period, the United States founded a number of hydrologic
> agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1802), the U.S.
> Geological Survey (USGS, 1879), the Weather Bureau (1891), and the
> Mississippi River Commission (1893). The Price current meter was
> invented in 1885, and Man- ning's formula was introduced in 1889
> (Manning, 1889). The Weather Bureau is now called the National Weather
> Service (NWS) and is one of six organizations underneath the National
> Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration (NOAA). NOAA is the agency
> responsible for weather data collec- tion and severe-storm, river, and
> hurricane forecasting for the United States, and many of its websites
> are listed throughout the textbook. The USGS gag- ing network for
> rainfall, streamflow, and water quality is one of the most extensive
> in the world.
>
> **Early History (1930s--1950s)**
>
> The period from 1930 to 1950, which Chow (1964) called the Period of
> Ratio- nalization, produced a significant step forward for the field
> of hydrology, as government agencies began to develop their own
> programs of hydrologic research. Sherman's unit hydrograph (1932) (see
> Chapter 2), Horton's infil- tration theory (1933), and Theis's
> nonequilibrium equation (1935) in well hydraulics (Chapter 8) advanced
> the state of hydrology in very significant ways. Gumbel (1958)
> proposed the use of extreme-value distributions for frequency analysis
> of hydrologic data, thus forming the basis for modern statistical
> hydrology (Chapter 3). In this period, the U.S. Army Corps of
> Engineers (ACOE), the NWS within NOAA, the U.S. Department of Agri-
> culture (USDA), and the USGS made significant contributions in
> hydrologic theory and the development of a national network of gages
> for precipitation, evaporation, and streamflow measurements. The NWS
> is still largely respon- sible for rainfall measurements, reporting
> and forecasting of severe storms, and other related hydrologic
> investigations.
>
> The U.S. ACOE and the USDA Soil Conservation Service (now called the
> Natural Resources Conservation Service \[NRCS\]) made significant con-
> tributions to the field of hydrology in relation to flood control,
> reservoir development, irrigation, and soil conservation during this
> period. More recently, the USGS has taken significant strides to set
> up a national network of stream gages and rainfall gages for both
> quantity and quality data. Their water supply publications and special
> investigations have done much to advance the field of hydrology by
> presenting the analysis of complex hydro- logic data to develop
> relationships and explain hydrologic processes. The NWS and USGS both
> support numerous websites for the dissemination of watershed
> information and precipitation and streamflow data from thousands
>
> of gages around the country. Many of these sites are listed in
> Appendix E and on the textbook website
> ([http://hydrology.rice.edu/bedient).](http://hydrology.rice.edu/bedient))
>
> The government agencies in the United States have long performed vital
> research themselves, providing funding for private and university
> research in the hydrologic area. Many of the water resources studies
> and large dam, reservoir, and flood control projects in the 1930s and
> 1940s were a direct result of advances in the fields of fluid
> mechanics, hydrologic sys- tems, statistical hydrology, evaporation
> analysis, flood routing, and opera- tions research. Many of the
> advances from that era continue to this day as the methods to predict
> runoff, infiltration, and evaporation have not changed much in over 50
> years. Major contributions from Horton (1933, 1940, 1941) and from
> Penman (1948) in understanding hydrologic losses were related to the
> water and irrigation needs of the agricultural sector in the United
> States following the devastation of the dust bowl era of the 1930s.
>
> Major water resources projects built during the 1930s were a direct
> result of major floods on the Mississippi River and the economic
> depression across the nation. The building of the massive Hoover Dam
> on the Colorado River for flood and sediment control and water supply
> in the early 1930s provided employment for over 40,000 and was the
> largest construction proj- ect ever conceived to that point (see
> Chapters 12 and 13).
>
> **Modern History**
>
> In the 1950s and 1960s, the tremendous increase of urbanization
> following World War II in the United States and Europe led to better
> methods for predicting peak flows from floods, for understanding
> impacts from urban expansion, and for addressing variations in storage
> in water supply reservoirs. Major expansion of cities and water
> systems within the United States during the 1950s led to a need for
> better understanding of floods and droughts, especially in urban
> areas. Water resource studies became an everyday occur- rence in many
> rapidly developing areas of the United States, tied to the expansion
> of population centers in the southern, southwestern, and western
> states. Hydrologic analyses presented in detail in Chapters 2 through
> 9 in the text were a major component of many of these studies.
>
> During the 1970s and early 1980s, the evaluation and delineation of
> floodplain boundaries became a major function of hydrologists, as
> required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local
> flood control or drainage districts. In order for communities to be
> eligible for flood insurance administered by FEMA, they are required
> to delineate floodplain boundaries using hydrologic analysis and
> models. Floodplain analysis is cov- ered in detail in Chapters 5, 7,
> 9, and 12. This function has taken on a vital role in many urban
> areas, as damages from severe floods and hurricanes continue to plague
> the United States, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. The
> period from 2004 to 2010 accounted for numerous hurricanes that caused
> massive damages and deaths in several areas, especially along the
>
> coastlines of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The
> mas- sive Mississippi flood of 1993 wreaked havoc within the central
> United States, and was repeated in 2011 with major devastation to
> states from Illi- nois south to Louisiana (Chapter 12).
>
> In recent years, the traditional approaches to flood control have been
> reassessed. A study titled "Higher Ground" from the National Wildlife
> Fed- eration (1998) found a number of communities with large numbers
> of repet- itive flood losses, such as New Orleans and Houston. Since
> the great midwestern flood of 1993, there has been a significant shift
> in national flood policy away from using only structural solutions,
> such as levee and channel construction. Flood damage from Tropical
> Storm Allison in Houston in 2001 was a major wake-up call for better
> protection and warning systems in criti- cal urban areas. The massive
> devastation from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in August 2005 and
> Hurricane Ike in 2008 in Houston-Galveston will provide long-lasting
> incentive to improve our ability to warn for and recover from such
> severe storms. Modern methods for structural flood con- trol, as well
> as nonstructural approaches, better management of flood-prone areas,
> and voluntary property buyouts, must be considered in any overall
> flood management plan (Chapter 12). Chapter 13 explores several major
> water resources projects across the United States and Asia in terms of
> engi- neering significance as well as associated environmental and
> policy impacts on the nation.
>
> **Computer Advances**
>
> The introduction of the digital computer into hydrology during the
> 1960s and 1970s allowed complex water problems to be simulated as
> complete systems for the first time. Large computer models can now be
> used to match historical data and help answer difficult hydrologic
> questions (Singh and Frevert, 2006). The development of these tools
> over the past few decades has helped direct the collection of the
> hydrologic data to calibrate, or "match," the models against
> observation. In the process, the understanding of the hydrologic
> system has been greatly advanced. Hydrologic computer models developed
> in the 1970s have been applied to areas previously unstud- ied or only
> empirically defined. For example, urban stormwater, floodplain and
> watershed hydrology, drainage design, reservoir design and operation,
> flood frequency analysis, and large-river basin management have all
> bene- fited from the application of computer models.
>
> Hydrologic simulation models applied to watershed analysis are
> described in detail in Chapter 5. Single-event models such as HEC-HMS
> are used to simulate or calculate the resulting storm hydrograph
> (discharge vs. time) from a well-defined watershed area for a given
> pattern of rainfall intensity. Continuous models such as the
> Hydrological Simulation Pro- gram---Fortran (HSPF) and the Storm Water
> Management Model (SWMM) can account for soil moisture storage,
> evapotranspiration, and antecedent
>
> rainfall over long time periods. Statistical models can be used to
> generate a time series of rainfall or streamflow data, which can then
> be analyzed with flood frequency methods.
>
> Newer distributed hydrologic models (i.e., VFLO and the MIKE series of
> models) can handle input, output, and data manipulation at the
> watershed level (see Chapters 5, 10, 11, and 12). Unquestionably new
> digital approaches combined with distributed terrain modeling have
> revolutionized hydrology in recent years, just as the original wave of
> models did in the decade of the 1970s. Also faster computers and
> available datasets have been instrumental in advancing the field.
>
> The data revolution in hydrology and geographical information sys-
> tems (GIS) have made available newer and more accurate datasets on
> topog- raphy, slope, rainfall, soils, land use, and channel
> characteristics for many areas. Moreover, most hydrological and
> meteorological data may be retrieved online from agencies such as the
> USGS and NWS, and various county and municipal sources. These
> datasets, combined with existing simu- lation models in hydrology, if
> applied correctly, provide the most accurate approach to understanding
> complex water resources systems, and a new era in the science of
> hydrology has begun this decade. New design and operating policies are
> being advanced and implemented that could not have been real- ized or
> tested before without the aid of sophisticated computer models linked
> with digital data.

> **WEATHER SYSTEMS**
>
> The atmosphere is the major hydrologic link between oceans and
> continents on the planet, facilitating the cycle of water movement on
> earth. The hydro- logic cycle is shaped by the conditions of the
> atmosphere, with precipitation as the main input to the cycle. Water
> vapor content is both a major catalyst and a balancing factor of
> atmospheric processes that create the weather in the lower atmosphere.
> The following section reviews major elements of atmospheric processes
> that directly impact the hydrologic cycle. More details on atmospheric
> processes can be found in modern meteorology and hydrol- ogy textbooks
> (Anthes, 1997; Ahrens, 2000; Dingman, 2002).
>
> **Atmospheric Parameters**
>
> Pressure is defined as the force per unit area exerted on a surface,
> and **atmo- spheric pressure** measures the weight of the air per unit
> area. Average air pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atmosphere,
> or 1013 millibars (mb) or 14.7 lb/in.^2^ or 760 mm-Hg or 29.97 in.-Hg.
> Note that 1 mb = 10^2^ pascals (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m^2^. As
> elevation increases and the density of air molecules decreases,
> atmospheric pressure also decreases. The horizontal and vertical
> pressure variations that occur due to low- and high-pressure systems
> are responsible for wind, and help drive much of our weather. Abso-
> lute temperature (*T*), pressure (*P*), and density 1r2 are related
> through the
>
> ideal gas law, *P* = r*RT*, where *R* is the gas constant for the gas
> in question (see Eq. 1--1). At constant density, temperature is
> directly proportional to pressure; thus, with an increase in
> temperature comes an increase in pres- sure. Air pressure is
> proportional to density, so that in the atmosphere a decrease in
> temperature causes an increase in the density of the air mole- cules.
> Cold air masses are generally associated with the higher atmospheric
> pressure.
>
> **Humidity** is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the
> atmosphere and can be expressed in several ways. Specific humidity is
> the mass of water vapor in a unit mass of moist air. The **relative
> humidity** is a ratio of the air's actual water vapor content compared
> to the amount of water vapor at satu- ration for that temperature. The
> partial pressure of water vapor is the con- tribution made by water to
> the total atmospheric pressure. When a volume reaches its maximum
> capacity for water vapor, the volume is said to be satu- rated and can
> accept no more vapor. This vapor pressure is known as **satura- tion
> vapor pressure**. Vapor pressure is dependent on temperature; and as
> air is lifted and cools, its relative humidity increases until
> saturation, and then condensation of water vapor to liquid water can
> occur. The temperature to which a sample of air must be cooled to
> reach saturation is defined as the **dew point temperature**. These
> concepts are described in more detail later in this section.
>
> Water vapor has the ability, unique among gases, to change from one
> state of matter to another (solid, liquid, or gas) at the temperatures
> and pressures that typically exist on earth. A change in phase (e.g.,
> from liquid to vapor) requires that heat be released or absorbed. The
> processes of con- verting solid ice to liquid water, called melting,
> and water to vapor, called evaporation, both require significant heat
> exchange. It takes approximately 600 cal to convert 1 g of water to
> water vapor. When such changes take place, the heat is absorbed and no
> temperature change takes place. The heat used in this process is
> latent heat. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes
> into a liquid state. For this to occur, energy must be released in an
> amount equivalent to what was absorbed during evaporation. This latent
> heat often becomes the source of energy for severe thunderstorms,
> tornadoes, and hurricanes.
>
> **The Atmosphere and Clouds**
>
> Atmospheric weather systems are fueled by solar input and
> characterized by air masses in motion, circulating winds, cloud
> generation, and changes in tem- perature and pressure. Lifting
> mechanisms are required for moist air masses to cool and approach
> saturation conditions. As a result of the interaction of rising air
> masses with atmospheric moisture, the presence of small atmospheric
> nuclei, and droplet growth, precipitation in the form of rain, snow,
> or hail can result. The exact mechanisms that lead to precipitation
> are sometimes quite complex and difficult to predict for specific
> areas. But precipitation remains
>
> as the main input to the hydrologic cycle, and the hydrologist needs a
> general understanding of the mechanisms that cause its formation.
>
> Horizontal variations in atmospheric pressure cause air to move from
> higher pressure toward lower pressure, resulting in the generation of
> wind. Vertical displacement causes air to move as well, but at a far
> slower rate than horizontal winds. The vertical movement and lifting
> of air results in the formation of clouds. Clouds are familiar to all
> of us, and represent collec- tions of small droplets of water or tiny
> crystals of ice. The names of the basic clouds have the following
> roots:
>
> **cirrus**, feathery or fibrous clouds
>
> **stratus**, layered clouds
>
> **cumulus**, towering, puffy clouds **alto**, middle-level clouds
> **nimbus**, rain clouds
>
> The second aspect of cloud classification is by height. Anthes (1997)
> presents a detailed coverage of cloud types for the interested
> student. One type of high cloud of importance in hydrology is the
> **cumulonimbus**, one often found in heavy thunderstorms that produce
> massive rainfall. Cirrus clouds are very high collections of ice
> crystals and often indicate the approach of a cold front and that
> weather is about to change. While clouds result when air rises and
> cools, surface fog results from cooling near the surface or from the
> addition of enough water vapor to cause saturation. Fog is essentially
> a low cloud with a base that is very near the ground, often reducing
> the visibil- ity in the area within or around it. Marine fog is common
> along the Califor- nia and upper Atlantic coasts in the United States.
>
> **General Circulation**
>
> The general circulation of wind across the earth is caused by the
> uneven heating of earth's surface through solar input, and by the
> earth's rotation. At the equator, solar radiation input and
> temperature are greatest because of the shape and tilt of the globe
> relative to the sun. Three latitudinal circu- lation cells transport
> heat from the equator to the poles (Fig. 1--3). As warm air travels
> northward in the middle latitudinal cell on a spinning earth, it tends
> to shift to the right (toward the east) in the northern hemisphere due
> to the Coriolis force, thus causing the occurrence of winds called
> **westerlies**. These winds tend to drive the direction of major
> weather systems from west to east across major portions of the
> continental United States.
>
> Between 30 degrees north latitude and the equator, the flow is
> generally toward the south and is altered to create the trade winds
> (**easterlies**) by the Coriolis force in the northern hemisphere. The
> trade winds allowed explorers from Europe to sail across the ocean to
> the New World. The Coriolis force causes the flow along latitude
> circles (east/west) to be 10 times greater than

> the flow along the meridians (north/south). Around the 30 degrees
> north and south latitudes, descending air creates a region of minimal
> winds and little cloudiness that is known as the horse latitudes. Near
> the equator is another region of light and variable winds called the
> doldrums, or the intertropical convergence zone. This is the area of
> maximum solar heating, where surface air rises and flows toward both
> poles.
>
> **Jet streams**, first observed in 1946, are narrow bands of
> high-speed winds that circle each hemisphere like great rivers, at
> elevations extending from 2.5 or 3 miles to above the tropopause. The
> polar and subtropical jets are associated with the polar front near 45
> degrees latitude and 30 degrees latitude, respectively. The jet
> streams are highly variable and can flow at speeds as high as 100 mph
> faster than the air on either side of them. Jet streams have a major
> impact as the driving force for weather systems across the United
> States, especially in the winter season.
>
> **Air Masses and Fronts**
>
> Air masses are large bodies of air with fairly consistent temperature
> and humidity gradients in the horizontal direction at a given
> altitude. Air masses dominate our weather and are classified in two
> ways: the source from which
>
> they were generated, land (continental) or water (maritime), and the
> latitude of generation (polar or tropical). The four combinations are
> designated cP, cT, mP, and mT.
>
> Each of these types of air masses is present in the United States. The
> continental polar air mass emanates from Canada and passes over the
> north- ern United States, often dropping significant amounts of rain
> and snow on areas downwind of the Great Lakes. The maritime polar air
> mass also comes southward from the Atlantic coast of Canada and
> affects the New England states. Another maritime polar air mass comes
> from the Pacific and hits the extreme northwestern states. The
> maritime tropical air masses come from the Pacific, the Gulf of
> Mexico, and the Atlantic. The entire southern United States is
> affected by these air masses. The only time continental tropical air
> masses form is during the summer, and they originate in Texas and
> affect the states bordering to the north.
>
> The boundary between one air mass and another is called a frontal
> zone, or **front**. When two air masses meet, the front will slope
> diagonally, as the colder, denser air mass pushes under the warmer air
> mass. Between the two fronts, a transition zone occurs, usually 30 to
> 60 miles wide. Whether the masses are traveling against each other or
> in the same direction, the warmer air mass will be forced upward and
> cooled by expansion. Since cooling a parcel of air lowers its
> saturation vapor pressure, this may cause condensa- tion and the
> development of precipitation often associated with frontal sys- tems
> (Fig. 1--4). The NWS website provides an amazing amount of weather
> information and satellite data all on one place
> ([http://www.nws.noaa.gov/).](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/))

> Direction of the cold and warm fronts in the eastern United States.
> The cold fronts come from the North toward the Gulf and the warm
> fronts start from the Gulf to push inland.
>
> Development of surface cyclones along fronts occurs when an upper-
> level disturbance approaches a front. The upper-level patterns of
> conver- gence and divergence produce pressure changes at the surface,
> which then produce low-level circulation (**wave cyclone**). As a wave
> cyclone develops, low pressure forms at its apex and both the warm and
> cold currents move in a cyclonic pattern (counterclockwise in the
> northern hemisphere) around it. To the left of the apex, the cold
> front is advancing towards the warm air, and the warm front is
> receding to the right. The warm air between the fronts is known as the
> warm sector. The entire system generally moves toward the right
> (eastward), and ahead of the warm front the first sign of the
> approach- ing system is high cirrus clouds. As the center of low
> pressure approaches, the pressure falls and the wind increases and
> changes its direction to coun- terclockwise. The temperature begins to
> decrease as the frontal zone approaches. Within several hundred miles
> of the surface position of the front, precipitation begins, either
> rain or snow. Fronts can be fast moving in the winter or can be slowed
> or stalled due to the presence of other air masses or high-pressure
> systems in the fall or spring (Anthes, 1997). Warm fronts can also
> generate rainfalls as they move across an area.
>
> Fronts are a major factor in U.S. weather patterns, especially from
> September through April in most years. The type of weather
> accompanying the passage of the cold front depends on the front's
> sharpness, its speed, and the stability of the air being forced aloft.
> Often there are towering cumulus clouds and showers along the forward
> edge of the front. Sometimes, espe- cially in the Midwest during the
> spring, several **squalls**, or a strong line of storms, precede the
> front. Tornadoes can form in these storm cells, especially in areas of
> north Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. But in other cases, nim-
> bostratus clouds and rain extend over a zone of 50 to 60 miles. After
> the frontal passage, the wind changes sharply and the pressure begins
> to rise. Within a short distance behind the cold front, the weather
> clears, the tem- perature begins to fall, and the visibility greatly
> improves.

> **Thunderstorms**
>
> Thunderstorm activity is characterized by cumulonimbus clouds that can
> produce heavy rainfall, thunder, lightning, and occasionally hail.
> Thunder- storms are the result of strong vertical movements in the
> atmosphere and usually occur in the spring or summer in the United
> States. They require warm, moist air, which when lifted will release
> enough latent heat to provide the buoyancy needed to maintain its
> upward motion. Accordingly, they gen- erally occur in warm air masses
> that have become unstable either through extreme low-pressure systems,
> surface heating, or forced ascent over moun- tains. The geographic
> pattern of thunderstorm occurrence in the United States is a result of
> both an area's distance from source air masses and its topography.
> Florida and the Gulf Coast are affected most frequently, some- times
> as often as 100 times in a year.

> The Cumulonimbus cloud that signals that a storm is approaching.
>
> Thunderstorms develop in three characteristic stages. The first is the
> cumulus stage, when moist air rises and cools and condenses into a
> cumulus cloud. The cumulus cloud then continues to grow taller as the
> rising air condenses at successively higher levels (Fig. 1--5). The
> diameter of the storm cell grows in width from about 1 mile to 6 to 9
> miles and vertically to 5 or 6 miles. The rising air is no longer able
> to retain water droplets and rain begins to fall.
>
> The rain marks the beginning of the second stage of the thunder-
> storm, the mature stage. During the mature stage, the large water
> particles or hail in the clouds begin to fall because they have become
> too large to be supported by the updraft. As this happens, drier air
> around the cloud is being drawn into it, in a process known as
> entrainment. This drying of the air results in the evaporation of some
> rain drops, which cools the air. The air is now colder and heavier
> than the air around it and, while the upper part of the cloud still
> has a strong updraft, a lower part of the storm cloud begins to
> descend as a downdraft. This downdraft eventually reaches the ground
> and spreads away from the thunderstorm, causing the cool gusts of wind
> that usually foreshadow the arrival of a thunderstorm. Meanwhile, the
> upper part of the cloud reaches a stable part of the atmosphere, and
> high-altitude winds may create a typical anvil shape (Fig. 1--6). The
> cloud reaches its greatest vertical development in this stage,
> extending upward over 7.5 mi (40,000 ft, 12 km). Lightning,
> turbulence, heavy rains, and, if present, hail are all found at this
> time. The second stage is the most intense period of the thunderstorm.
>
> When the downdraft has spread over the entire storm cell and the
> updraft has been cut off, the storm begins its final stage, the
> dissipating stage. The rate of precipitation diminishes and so the
> downdrafts are also gradually subdued. The final flashes of lightning

> **Hurricanes**

> **Tropical cyclones** or **hurricanes** are intense cyclonic storms
> that form over the tropical oceans, between 5 and 20 degrees latitude.
> With extreme amounts of rainfall and winds that can exceed 186 mph
> (300 km/hr), trop- ical cyclones are the most destructive storms on
> earth. The local name for this storm varies throughout the world:
> typhoon in Eastern Asia, cyclone in India, and baguio in the China
> Sea. The North American term, used in this discussion, is hurricane.
> By international agreement, a storm is a hur- ricane if it has wind
> speeds of at least 74 mph (119 km/hr) and a rotary circulation. When
> its wind speeds are between 39 mph (63 km/hr) and 73 mph (119 km/hr),
> it is a tropical storm. Tropical disturbances with winds that do not
> exceed 39 mph (61 km/hr) are tropical depressions. All tropical storms
> and hurricanes are given proper names in alphabetical order, start-
> ing at the beginning of the alphabet when the storm season begins on
> June 1 and starting over during the next season. Hurricanes are
> classified accord- ing to a scale based on central pressure, storm
> surge height, and wind speed. The scale has five categories, ranging
> from category 1, a hurricane of minimal damage, to category 5, a
> hurricane of catastrophic proportions (see Table 1--1).

> The warm, moisture-laden air of the tropical oceans possesses an enor-

> condensation from vapor to water. Hurricanes develop most often during
> the late summer when the oceans are warm (26°C or higher) and are thus
> able to provide the necessary heat and moisture to the air. The
> hurricane season in the West Indies extends from June 1 to November 1,

> **Moisture Relationships**
>
> Atmospheric moisture is a necessary source for precipitation and is
> generally provided from evaporation and transpiration. Precipitation
> across the United States is largely due to proximity of evaporation
> from oceans and the Gulf of Mexico and to subsequent transport over
> the continent by the atmo- spheric circulation system. Common measures
> of atmospheric moisture, or humidity, include vapor pressure, specific
> humidity, mixing ratio, relative humidity, and dew point temperature.
> (Most of these terms were defined earlier in the chapter.) Under moist
> conditions, water vapor can be assumed to obey the ideal gas law,
> which allows derivation of simple relations between pressure, density,
> and temperature.
>
> The partial pressure is the pressure that would be exerted on the sur-
> face of a container by a particular gas in a mixture. The partial
> pressure exerted by water vapor is called **vapor pressure** and can
> be derived from Dalton's law and the ideal gas law as

> r*~w~* = vapor density or absolute humidity (g/cm^3^),
>
> *R* = dry air gas constant = 2.87 \* 10^3^ mb cm^3^/g°K,
>
> *T* = absolute temperature (°K).
>
> The factor 0.622 arises from the ratio of the molecular weight of
> water (18) to that of air (29). Near the earth's surface, the water
> vapor pressure is 1% to 2% of the total atmospheric pressure, where
> average atmospheric pres- sure is 1013.2 mb (1 mb = 10^2^ pascals
> (Pa)). **Saturation vapor pressure** is the partial pressure of water
> vapor when the air is completely saturated (no further evaporation
> occurs) and is a function of temperature.
>
> **Relative humidity** (*RH*) is approximately the ratio of water vapor
> pressure to that which would prevail under saturated conditions at the
> same temperature. It can also be stated as *RH* = 100 *e*\>*e~s~*.
> Thus, 50% relative humidity means that the atmosphere contains 50% of
> the maximum moisture it could hold under saturated conditions at that
> temperature. Typical relative humidity averages (high and low
> percentages) for eight major American cities are as follows: Houston
> (89, 67), Seattle (84, 62), Chicago (80, 64), New York
>

>
> In order for vapor to condense to water to begin the formation of
> precipita- tion, a quantity of heat known as latent heat must be
> removed from the moist air. The **latent heat** of condensation *L~c~*
> is equal to the latent heat of evapora- tion *L~e~*, the amount of
> heat required to convert water to vapor at the same temperature. With
> *T* measured in °C,

*L~e~* = - *L~c~* = 597.3 - 0.57(*T* - 0°C), (1--5)

where *L~e~* is in cal/g. The latent heat of melting and freezing are
also related:

> *L~m~* = - *L~f~* = 79.7,
>
> where *L~m~* is also in cal/g. Thus, it takes about 7.5 times the
> energy to evapo- rate a gram of water compared to melting a gram of
> ice.
>
> As moist, unsaturated air rises, the relative humidity increases, and
> at some elevation saturation is reached and relative humidity becomes
> 100%. Fur- ther cooling of the air results in condensation of the
> moisture at a defined lifting condensation level (LCL). Latent heat of
> condensation is released, warming the air and lowering the atmospheric
> lapse rate, or the rate of temperature change with elevation. As
> discussed earlier, latent heat exchange is the major energy source
> that fuels tropical cyclones and hurricanes. It has also been observed
> that a relation does not necessarily exist between the amount of water
> vapor and the resulting precipitation over a region. Thus,
> condensation can occur in cloud formations without the production of
> precipitation at the ground surface.
>
> Meteorologists use the moisture relationships and the latent-heat con-
> cepts to obtain pressure--temperature relationships for cooling of
> rising moist air in the atmosphere. The rate of temperature change
> with elevation in the atmosphere is called the **adiabatic lapse
> rate**. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) is 9.8°C per km and
> assumes no phase changes of water. The average ambient lapse rate is
> about 6.5°C per km, but varies with moisture conditions. An unstable
> atmosphere is one in which the ambient lapse rate is greater than the
> DALR. A stable atmosphere is one in which the ambient lapse rate is
> less than the DALR, and an air parcel tends to cool faster than the
> environment as it rises vertically. Figure 1--8 shows the variation of
> lapse rates and different types of atmospheric conditions, with an
> unstable atmo- sphere being very conducive to lifting of moist air and
> to formation of severe weather and/or rainfall conditions.

    surroundings. The atmosphere is stable with respect to unsaturated,

3.  a phase change must occur with resulting condensation onto small
    nuclei in the air,

4.  droplets must grow large enough to overcome drag and evaporation to
    reach the ground.

> Orographic precipitation is caused by mechanical lifting of moist air
> over mountain ranges. Notable examples include the western side of the
> Cascade Mountains, the western side of the Andes in Chile, and the
> western coast of Norway. On the lee side of mountain barriers are dry
> areas, called rain shadows, since most of the moisture is dropped as
> rain or snow over the mountain ranges. Good examples of rain shadows
> can be found east of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and east of
> the Sierra Nevada range in California (see Fig. 1--10).

> **Condensation** of water vapor into cloud droplets occurs due to
> cooling of moist air to a temperature below the saturation point for
> water vapor. This is most commonly achieved through vertical lifting
> to levels where pressure and temperature are lower. A large portion of
> the atmospheric mass lies within 18,000 ft of the surface and contains
> most of the clouds and moisture. Condensation can be caused by (1)
> adiabatic cooling (no heat loss to sur- roundings), (2) mixing of air
> masses having different temperatures, (3) cool- ing by advection of
> cold air masses, and (4) cooling by radiation. Adiabatic cooling is by
> far the most important producer of appreciable precipitation.

> Small condensation nuclei must be present for the formation of cloud
> droplets. Such nuclei come from many sources, such as ocean salt, dust
> from clay soils, industrial combustion products, and volcanoes, and
> they range in size from 0.1 m to 10 m. Cloud droplets originally
> average 0.01 mm in diam- eter, and it is only when they exceed 0.5 mm
> that significant precipitation occurs. It may take hours for a small
> raindrop (1 mm) to grow on a conden- sation nucleus. As vapor-laden
> air rises, it cools as it expands; and as satura- tion occurs, water
> vapor begins to condense on the most active nuclei. The principal
> mechanism for the supply of water to the growing droplet in early
> stages is diffusion of water-vapor molecules down the vapor-pressure
> gradi- ent toward the droplet surface. As the droplets increase in
> mass, they begin to move relative to the overall cloud. However, other
> processes must support the growth of droplets of sufficient size
> (0.5--3.0 mm) to overcome air resis- tance and to fall as
> precipitation. These include the coalescence process and the
> ice-crystal process.
>
> The **coalescence process** is considered dominant in summer shower
> precipitation. As water droplets fall, the smaller ones are overtaken
> by larger ones, and droplet size is increased through collision. This
> can produce significant precipitation, especially in warm cumulus
> clouds in tropical regions. The **ice-crystal process** attracts
> condensation on freezing nuclei because of lower vapor pressures. The
> ice crystals grow in size through contact with other particles, and
> collisions cause snowflakes to form. Snow- flakes may change into rain
> droplets after entering air in which the tem- perature is above
> freezing. Snowfall and snowmelt processes are presented in detail in
> Chapter 2.

> **Point Measurement**
>
> The main source of moisture for annual rainfall totals is evaporation
> from the oceans; thus, precipitation tends to be heavier near the
> coastlines, with distor- tion due to orographic effects---that is,
> effects of changes in elevation over mountain ranges. In general,
> amount and frequency of precipitation is greater on the windward side
> of mountain barriers (the western side for the United States) and less
> on the lee side (eastern side), also shown in Figure 1--10.
> Considerable amounts of precipitation data are available from the NWS,
> the USGS, and various local governmental agencies. A number of useful
> websites for precipitation data are listed in Appendix E and on the
> textbook website
> [http://hydrology.rice.edu.](http://hydrology.rice.edu/)
> Interpretation of national networks of rainfall data shows extreme
> variability in space and time, as can be seen in annual and monthly
> variations in Figures 1--10 and 1--11, respectively.
>
> Time variation of precipitation occurs seasonally or within a single
> storm, and distributions vary with storm type, intensity, duration,

(c) Isohyetal method

> The **Thiessen polygon method** \[Fig. 1--16(b)\] allows for areal
> weighting of rainfall from each gage. Such a polygon is the locus of

> are drawn between stations located on a map. Perpendicular bisectors
> are drawn to form polygons around each gage, and the ratio of the area
> of each polygon *A~i~* within the watershed boundary to the total area
> *A~T~* is used to weigh each station's rainfall. The method is unique
> for each gage network and does not allow for orographic effects (those
> due to elevation changes), but it is probably the most widely used of
> the three available methods.
>
> The **isohyetal method** \[Fig. 1--16(c)\] involves drawing contours
> of equal precipitation (isohyets) and is the most accurate method.
> However, an extensive gage network is required to draw isohyets
> accurately. The rainfall calculation is based on finding the average
> rainfall between each pair of contours, multiplying by the area
> between them, totaling these products, and dividing by the total area.
> The isohyetal method can include orographic effects and storm
> morphology and can represent an accurate map of the rainfall pattern,

(a) For the arithmetic averaging method, only the gages within the
    watershed are used---in this example the gages B and D. Thus, the
    arithmetic average is

> (6.74 + 6.01)\>2 = 6.38 in.

(b) The first step in the Thiessen polygon method is to connect all
    nearby rain gages by straight lines. The result is a system of tri-
    angles, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure E1--3b. Next, we
    construct perpendicular bisectors of the dashed lines in Figure
    E1--3c. The bisectors meet at a common point inside or outside the
    triangle. The resulting polygons around each rainfall gage are known
    as the Thiessen polygons.

> **SIMPLE RAINFALL-- RUNOFF**
>
> One of the simplest rainfall--runoff formulas, which is often used for
> drainage design purposes in small watersheds and/or basins, is the

> prediction of peak flow *Q~p~* (cfs) from the formula

where

> *Q~p~* = *CiA* (1--13)
>
> *C* = runoff coefficient, variable with land use,
>
> *i* = intensity of rainfall of chosen frequency for a duration equal

>
> *t~c~* = equilibrium time for rainfall occurring at the most remote
> portion of the basin to contribute flow at the outlet (min or hr),
>
> *A* = area of watershed (acres).
>
> The Rational Method is usually attributed to Kuichling (1889) and
> Lloyd- Davies (1906), but Mulvaney (1851) clearly outlined the
> procedure in a paper in Ireland. The underlying assumption is that a
> steady, uniform rainfall rate will produce maximum runoff when all
> parts of a watershed are contributing to out- flow, a condition that
> is met after the time of concentration *t~c~* has elapsed. Time of
> concentration *t~c~* is defined as the time for a wave of water to
> propagate from the most distant point in the basin to the outlet (see
> Section 2.1). Runoff is as- sumed to reach a maximum when the rainfall
> intensity lasts as long as the *t~c~*. The runoff coefficient is
> assumed constant during a storm event. More details can be found in

> systems, culverts, and open channels. Chapters 6 and 9 present
> detailed discussion and examples of the rational method applied to
> small watershed areas. Larger wa- tersheds (greater than a few square

**STREAMFLOW**

> The hydrologic cycle is shown as a schematic in Figure 1--1, where
> precipita- tion *P* initially falls on the land surface, and it may
> distribute to fill **depres- sion storage**, infiltrate to become soil
> moisture and shallow ground water, or travel as interflow to a
> receiving stream. Evaporation *E* is often a small component of a
> specific storm event, since it is minimal as rain is actually falling,
> and is usually only a factor in longer-term water balances. Depression
> storage capacity is usually satisfied early in storm passage, followed
> by infil- tration capacity into the soil (see Fig. 1--20). Eventually,
> overland flow and surface runoff commence after soil storage and
> depression storage are satis- fied. Overland flow then quickly moves
> down-gradient toward the nearest small rivulet or channel, which then

> The classic concept of streamflow generation by **overland flow** is

> heterogeneity, which exists across natural watersheds, and developed
> the partial area con- tribution concept (Betson, 1964). This model
> recognized that only certain portions of a watershed regularly
> contribute overland flow to streams and that no more than about 10% of
> a watershed contributes overland flow. In urban environments with
> large areas of impervious cover, the overland flow percentage may be
> larger. Significant surface runoff occurs only after rainfall
> intensity exceeds infiltration capacity, or (*i* 7 *f*) and soil
> moisture storage has been filled. Infiltration *f* is the loss rate
> into the soil system.
>
> The channel may contain a certain amount of **baseflow** coming from
> ground water and soil contributions even in the absence of rainfall.
> Discharge from rainfall excess, after infiltration losses have been
> subtracted, makes up the **direct-runoff hydrograph (DRO)**. The total
> storm hydrograph consists of direct runoff plus baseflow. The duration
> of rainfall determines the portion of watershed area contributing to
> the peak, and the intensity of rainfall deter- mines the resulting
> peak flow rate. If rainfall maintains a constant intensity for a very
> long time, maximum storage is achieved and a state of equilibrium dis-
> charge is reached, where the hydrograph tends to level off to a
> constant value for a period of time. The condition of equilibrium
> discharge is seldom attained over a large basin in nature because of
> the variability of actual rainfall.

> Chapters 6 and 9). As can be seen, the shape and timing of the
> hydrograph are largely related to watershed shape characteristics, and

> intensity. The contributions also depend on the level of **soil
> moisture storage** *S~D~* vs. **field capacity** *F* of the soil,
> which is defined as the amount of water held in place after excess

>
> However, the extreme case where both *i* 7 *f* and *F* 7 *S~D~* is
> typical of a large storm event in which direct surface runoff,
> interflow, and base flow all contribute to the hydrograph. In this
> case, the intensity of rainfall domi- nates the system, and large

> the response. In more forested and natural watersheds, infiltration
> and surface roughness may be major factors and significantly alter the
> hydrograph.
>
> Infiltration is one of the most complex of hydrologic phenomena. Hor-
> ton (1933) showed that when the rainfall rate *i* exceeds the
> infiltration rate *f*, water infiltrates the surface soils at a rate
> that generally decreases with time (Fig. 1--28). These rates are
> usually reported in inches per hour. For any given soil, a limiting

> **Recession and Base Flow Separation**
>
> It is generally customary to consider the hydrograph to be divided
> into only two parts: direct runoff (DRO) and base flow (BF), as shown
> in Figures 1--26 and 1--27. DRO may include some interflow, whereas
> base flow is considered to be mostly from contributing ground water.
> In most urban streams, base flow will be a relatively small component,
> usually less than a few percent, while it can be a significant
> component in a large river basin.
>
> Several techniques exist to separate DRO from base flow based on the

>
> where
>
> *q*~0~ = specified initial discharge, *q~t~* = discharge at a later

>
> Equations of this form are used often in engineering to describe
> first-order decay or depletion. Equation (1--14) will plot as a
> straight-line depletion curve on semilogarithmic paper, and the
> difference between this curve and
>
> the total hydrograph plotted on the same paper represents the DRO.
> Several storms should be used in order to develop a master depletion
> curve (Mc- Cuen, 2005). In practice, there are three simpler methods
> for handling base flow separation. The base flow recession can be
> extended forward under the peak of the hydrograph, starting with the
> point of lowest discharge and then extending at constant discharge to
> a point on the recession limb (*AD* in Fig. 1--27). The inflection
> point on the recession is assumed to be the point where the DRO ends.
> A second method is the concave method, where base flow is extended
> under the peak of the hydrograph and then is connected to the
> inflection point on the recession curve (*ABC*). Figure 1--27 shows
> two of the above methods. Computerized methods for base flow
> separation are also available (Sloto and Crouse, 1996).
>
> The separation methods all suffer the disadvantage of being arbitrary
> and somewhat inaccurate. At present, base flow separation is more an
> art than a science. In many cases of practical interest such as urban
> drainage, base flow is often neglected because it represents such a
> small component. Base flow is usually more important in natural
> streams and large rivers because of the contribution along the banks
> from a water table.

> **Net Storm Rainfall and the Hydrograph**
>
> Surface runoff phenomena have been discussed above, and the
> distribution of gross rainfall can be divided into components of
> infiltration, depression storage, detention storage, and direct
> runoff. We can write the continuity equation for this process as

> It is often important to determine the time distribution for rainfall

> rainfall excess include the Horton infiltration method and the f index
> method, with initial loss included for depression storage, as shown in

> rainfall and hydrograph vol- umes using various infiltration equations
> (i.e., compute in./hr over the water- shed area), as described in
> detail in Example 1.6. The Horton method estimates infiltration with

> **HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT**
>
> Hydrologic processes vary in space and time, and accurate measurement
> requires the use of sophisticated instruments, which are usually at a
> fixed location in space. The resulting data from rainfall,
> evaporation, or stream- flow levels measured over time create a time
> series, which may be further analyzed statistically. The overall
> sequence of steps for hydrologic measure- ment includes

1.  Sensing, which transforms the intensity of the process into a
    measur- able signal;

2.  Recording, usually in electronic form;

3.  Transmitting to a central processing site via telemetry;

4.  Translating, which converts the record into a data sequence;

5.  Editing, or checking for any errors in the data;

6.  Storing, in a computer database for viewing;

7.  Retrieving the data for further use.

> The advent of advanced telemetry, radar systems, use of the Internet,
> and use of large database storage devices has revolutionized
> hydrologic informa- tion storage, retrieval, and distribution. A
> number of useful websites often used in hydrology for rainfall and
> streamflow data are listed in Appendix E.
>
> **Atmospheric Parameters and Precipitation**
>
> The measurement of atmospheric moisture near the ground often utilizes
> a climate station, which usually consists of a psychrometer (or
> hygrometer) to measure humidity, a rainfall gage, an evaporation pan,
> and an anemometer for wind speed and direction. Total incoming or
> outgoing radiation can be measured with a radiometer. Weather balloons
> are used to measure tem- perature, humidity, air pressure, and wind
> speed at various elevations above the earth.
>
> The fundamental instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure is the
> mercurial **barometer**, which is constructed by filling a long glass
> tube with mercury. The barometer acts as a weighing balance, and
> changes in atmo- spheric pressure are detected from changes in the
> height of the column of mercury. The **psychrometer** is an instrument
> based on temperature differ- ences between two thermometers, one of
> which is covered in a wet cloth, called the wet bulb. The difference
> in temperature of the dry and wet bulbs, when ventilated, is a measure
> of degree of saturation of the air, which is a measure of relative
> humidity.
>
> Precipitation or rainfall is measured at a point with either
> non-recording or recording gages. The non-recording gage consists of a
> simple open tube with readings along the side for visually determining
> rainfall amounts. Recording gages are required in urban settings for
> flood control studies if the time distribution of rainfall is desired.
> The tipping bucket recording gage operates off a pair of small buckets
> (Fig. 1--14a), which move in a flip-flop motion and make electrical
> contact for every increment of rainfall. The buck- ets direct water
> into a reservoir, which can be checked for cumulative totals at the
> end of a storm event. The gage usually records every 0.01 in. or 0.1
> in. of rain and telemeters this to a central computer for storage and
> analysis.
>
> **Radar** (radio detection and ranging) has been used to measure
> rainfall rates on the ground since 1994, and GIS methods have greatly
> improved our ability to determine rainfall rates for specific
> watershed areas. Chapter 11 presents more details.
>
> **Evaporation and Infiltration Losses**
>
> **Evaporation** is the process by which water in its liquid or solid
> state is trans- formed into water vapor, which mixes with the
> atmosphere. **Evapotranspi- ration** (*ET*) is considered separately
> as the combined loss of water vapor from the surface of plants
> (transpiration) and the evaporation of moisture from soil. Knowledge
> of evaporation processes is important in predicting water losses to
> evaporation from a lake or reservoir. On average, approxi- mately 70%
> of the mean annual rainfall in the United States is returned to the
> atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration. However, variations in
> evaporation across the continent can be very large due to effects of
> solar input, location of mountains, and proximity to oceans. On an
> annual basis, evaporation rates can exceed mean annual rainfall,
> especially in arid regions
>
> of the southwest. For example, arid areas in Texas, Arizona, New
> Mexico, Nevada, and southern California can exceed 70 inches per year,
> compared to about 30 to 40 inches per year for much of the rest of the
> country. For the case of evaporation from a lake surface, water loss
> is a function of solar radiation, temperature of the water and air,
> difference in vapor pressure between water and the overlying air, and
> wind speed across the lake.
>
> Evaporation is important in the long-term water balance and is usually
> of concern for large-scale water resources planning and water supply
> studies, especially in the Western states where evaporation rates can
> exceed rainfall rates. During typical storm periods, with intensities
> of 0.5 in./hr, evaporation is on the order of 0.01 in./hr and is
> normally neglected for flood flow studies and urban drainage design
> applications.
>
> Measurement of evaporation is usually from a standard class A pan
> (Fig. 1--29), which is filled to 8 in. and then observed on a daily
> basis. Adjust- ments are made for rainfall input using a rainfall gage
> nearby. Methods to compute and measure evaporation and
> evapotranspiration are covered in detail in Section 2.6. Evaporation
> and ET are very difficult to measure accu- rately for large
> watersheds.
>
> **Infiltration**, or movement of water from the surface into the soil
> zone, can be measured with a ring infiltrometer, which is a ring about
> 2 ft in diam- eter driven into the soil. Water is placed in the ring,
> and the rate of infiltra- tion, *f*, is measured by the drop in water
> level over time. Carefully controlled experiments require the use of
> tensiometers to measure capillary suction with depth, electrical
> resistance to record moisture content, and wells to record the
> response at the water table below. Infiltration is one of the most
> difficult hydrologic parameters to measure because of the extreme
> variations in soil and water conditions, which can greatly affect the
> measured rate. In actual watersheds, infiltration is often determined
> by the difference between gross rainfall and direct runoff measured
> from a hydrograph. Both simple and advanced infiltration methods are
> presented in Sections 2.7 and 2.8.

> **Streamflow Measurement**
>
> Streamflow is generally measured by observing stage, or elevation
> above a specified elevation datum (i.e., mean sea level), in a channel
> and then relat- ing stage to discharge via a rating curve. A staff
> gage is a fixed scale set so that a portion is immersed in water and
> can be read manually during storm passage. A wire-weight gage is
> lowered from a bridge structure to the water surface, and readings are
> taken as a function of time through a storm event. A crest stage gage
> uses a small amount of cork inside an enclosed staff gage. The cork
> floats as the water rises and adheres to the scale recording at the
> highest water level.
>
> Most automatic recording gages, such as those used by the USGS for
> routine streamflow monitoring, use a float-type device to measure
> stage or a gas bubbler to measure pressure (Fig. 1--30a). The bubble
> gage senses water level by maintaining a continuous stream of gas in a
> small pipe under the water. Another approach is to use a pressure
> transducer near the bottom of a stream that senses the pressure or
> height of water that sits above the monitor. In some urban basins,
> hydrologic data are often transmitted over telephone lines or through
> telemetry directly into computers. Acoustic Doppler flow meters (ADFM)
> have recently emerged as a new method to accurately measure flow rate
> by measuring the actual velocity profile in a pipe or open channel.

> 0.2*D* and 0.8*D* (down from the surface), where *D* is stream depth,
> and average the two values (see Fig. 1--30b).
>
> The total discharge is found by dividing the channel into several
> sections, as shown in Figure 1--30b. The average velocity of each
> section is multiplied by its associated area (width times depth of
> section), and these are summed across the channel to yield total
> discharge *Q* corre- sponding to a particular stage *z*, obtaining one
> point on the graph in Fig- ure 1--31. Other points are obtained by
> measuring velocity at different stages in the stream. Rating curves
> can change through time, as water- sheds change in terms of land use
> and channel type, and should be rechecked periodically.
>
> It will be shown in Chapter 4 that actual rating curves can be looped
> because of storage and hydraulic effects in the channel, and the
> single- valued rating curve is at best an approximation to the actual
> relationship (see Fig. 4--14). A more detailed discussion of
> streamflow prediction and measurement is contained in Chapter 4.

> is equipped with telemetry for radio signals back to a base station or

> **CONCEPT CHECK**

1.  What is the hydrologic cycle? What are the pathways that
    precipitation falling onto the land surface of the earth is
    dispersed to the hydrologic cycle?

2.  Who is responsible for the first recorded rainfall measurements?
    Describe the technique used to obtain these measurements.

3.  Explain the difference between humidity and relative humidity.

4.  Explain how air masses are classified. Where are these types of air
    masses located?

5.  List seven major factors that determine a watershed's response to a
    given rainfall.

> **PROBLEMS**

6.  A lake with a surface area of 750 acres was monitored over a period
    of time. During a one-month period, the inflow was 35 cfs, the
    outflow was 28 cfs, and a 1.5-in. seepage loss was measured. During
    the same month, the total precipita- tion was 4.8 in. Evaporation
    loss was estimated as 6.0 in. Estimate the storage change for this
    lake during the month.

7.  Clear Lake has a surface area of 610,000 m^2^ (61.0 ha). For a given
    month, the lake has an inflow of 1.5 m^3^/s and an outflow of 1.25
    m^3^/s. A + 1.0-m storage change or increase in lake level was
    recorded. If a precipitation gage recorded a total of 20 cm for this
    month, determine the evaporation loss (in cm) for the lake. Assume
    that seepage loss is negligible.

8.  In a given month, a watershed with an area of 1500 m^2^ received 100
    cm of precipitation. During the same month, the loss due to
    evaporation was 15 cm. Ignore losses due to transpiration and
    infiltration due to ground water. What would be the average rate of
    flow measured in a gage at the outlet of the wa- tershed in
    *m*^3^\>day?

9.  In a given year, a watershed with an area of 2000 km^2^ received 120
    cm of precipitation. The average rate of flow measured in a gage at
    the outlet of the watershed was 30 m^3^/sec. Estimate the water
    losses due to the combined effects of evaporation, transpiration,
    and infiltration due to ground water. How much runoff reached the
    river for the year (in cm)?

10. Using the data from problem 1.9, what is the runoff coefficient?

11. Plot Equation (1--4) as a graph (*e~s~* vs. *T*) for a range of
    temperatures from

> \- 305C to 405C and a range of pressures from 0 to 70 mb. The area
> below the curve represents the unsaturated air condition. Using this
> graph, answer the following:

a.  Select two saturated and two unsaturated samples of air from the
    dataset of pressure and temperature given below:

> Pressure (mb): {10, 20, 30}
>
> Temperature (5C): {10, 20, 30}

b.  Let A and B be two air samples, where A: (*T* = 30°C, *P* = 20 mb)
    and B: (*T* = 30°C, *P* = 40 mb). For each sample, determine the
    following:

    i.  Saturation vapor pressure

    ii. Dew point

    iii. Relative humidity

c.  Suppose both samples A and B were cooled to 20°C. What would be
    their relative humidity? What would be their dew point temperature?

12. The gas constant *R* has the value 2.87 × 10^6^ cm^2^/s^2^ °K for
    dry air, when pres- sure is in mb. Using the ideal gas law (*P* =
    r*RT*), find the density of dry air at 255C with a pressure of 1150
    mb. Find the density of moist air at the same pressure and
    temperature if the relative humidity is 65%.

13. At a weather station, the air pressure was measured to be 95.1 kPa,
    the air temperature was 225C, and the dew point temperature was
    185C. Calculate the corresponding vapor pressure, relative humidity,
    specific humidity, and air density. First compute *e* and *e~s~*.

14. What are the three main mechanisms for generation of vertical air
    motion?

15. Describe the naming system for describing basic clouds.

16. Below are three different atmospheric systems. The dashed line
    represents the dry adiabatic lapse rate where as the solid line
    represents the dry ambient lapse rate. Label whether the atmosphere
    is stable, unstable, or neutral:

21. Table P1--21 lists rainfall data recorded at a USGS gage for the
    storm of Sep- tember 1, 1999. The basin area is 2050 acres. Using
    these data, develop a rain- fall hyetograph (in./hr vs. *t*) in
    15-min intervals and determine the time period with the highest
    intensity rainfall.

23. What is the runoff coefficient for the September 1, 1999, storm,
    > where Coeff.

> = *R*\>*P*?

24. The following questions refer to Figure 1--15, the IDF curve for
    > Houston, Texas.

    a.  What is the return period of a storm that recorded 3.1 in./hr
        > for 2 hr in Houston?

    b.  What amount of rain (in.) would have to fall in a 6-hr period to
        > be consid- ered a 100-yr storm in Houston?

    c.  What is the return period of a storm that lasts 1 hr and records
        > 3.5 in. of rainfall?

    d.  Develop and plot a 6-hr, 100-yr storm design rainfall using 1-hr
        > time steps (see Fig. 1--8). Assume the maximum hourly value
        > occurs between hours 3 and 4.

        i.  Find the rainfall intensity for a 1-hr duration and plot the
            > rainfall intensity in in./hr between the hours of 3 and 4
            > on a bar graph.

        ii. Then, find the rainfall intensity for a 2-hr duration;
            > multiply the in- tensity by the duration of rain to get
            > the volume. Plot the difference between the 2-hr duration
            > volume and the 1-hr duration volume for hour 2 to 3 on a
            > bar graph.

        iii. Continue in the same way for the 3-hr duration, plotting
             > the new intensity to the right of the maximum (hour
             > between 4--5). (Find the 3-hr volume and subtract the
             > 2-hr volume.)

        iv. Then, find the rainfall intensity for a 6-hr duration and
            the respective volume. Plot the remaining volume (6-hr minus
            3-hr) over the 3 hr, assuming equal distribution between
            them, with two bars to the left and one to the right of the
            maximum (time intervals 0--1, 1--2, and 5--6).

25. Given the stream section shown in Figure P1--25 and the following
    measure- ments, calculate the total discharge throughout the section
    (Table P1--25).

26. Assume that stations B through L in Problem 1--25 have all become
    0.2 ft deeper. In addition, a tributary has joined the stream and
    added approximately 600 cfs to the flow in the channel. Calculate
    the new discharge amounts for each station by altering the depths
    and adding the tributary's contribution across the channel in
    proportion to the modified discharge distribution. As- sume velocity
    distribution remains unchanged.

27. The incremental rainfall data in the table were recorded at a
    > rainfall gage on a small urban parking lot of 1 acre. Be careful
    > to use a 0.5-hr time step and record intensity in cm/hr.

    a.  Plot the rainfall hyetograph.

    b.  Determine the total storm rainfall depth (inches).

    c.  If 100% of the rainfall occurs as runoff and the time base of a
        > triangular hydrograph (flow rate vs. time) is 3 hr, find the
        > peak flow of the hydro- graph in cfs. Be careful with units.

> *Hint:* First find the volume of rainfall, then equate it to the area
> under the hydrograph.

**2.1**

> **WATERSHED CONCEPTS**
>
> **88**
>
> The **watershed** is the basic unit used in most hydrologic
> calculations relating to the water balance or computation of
> rainfall--runoff and other losses. The **watershed boundary** defines
> a contiguous area, such that the net rainfall or runoff over that area
> will contribute water to the outlet (Fig. 1--19(b)). Rain that falls
> outside the watershed boundary will generate runoff to some other
> outlet. A watershed boundary can be drawn from a topographic map by
> defining the ridgeline to the outlet, and runoff will generally travel
> from higher to lower elevation in a direction perpendicular to the
> elevation con- tours (see Fig. 1--19(b)).
>
> Hydrologists are most often concerned with the amount of surface
> runoff generated within a watershed that becomes streamflow for a
> given input rainfall pattern. The main watershed characteristics that
> affect hydro- logic response include the size, shape, slope, soil
> type, and storage within a watershed area. These issues are described
> in some detail in this chapter and form the basis for more detailed
> analyses in later chapters. The **hydrograph**, as presented earlier,
> is a plot of flow rate vs. time for a given location within a stream
> and represents the main hydrologic response function. Several
>
> example watersheds were depicted in Figure 1--19(a), and a typical
> water- shed with subareas depicted is shown in Figure 1--22.
>
> Watersheds are often characterized by one main channel and by tribu-
> taries that drain into a main channel at one or more confluence
> points. The subarea of a tributary can be delineated by starting at
> the confluence and drawing a boundary along the subarea ridgeline.
> Larger watersheds can have many subareas that contribute runoff to a
> single outlet. An important water- shed parameter is drainage area
> *A*, since it reflects the volume of water that can be generated from
> rainfall. Watershed length measures are depicted for subarea E in
> Figure 1--22. Channel length *L* is usually measured along the main
> channel from the outlet to the basin divide. Length to centroid *L~c~*
> is measured along the main channel to a point nearest the centroid
> (center of mass) of the watershed. These two length parameters help
> determine water- shed shape and are used extensively in unit
> hydrograph calculations dis- cussed later (Section 2.3).
>
> Another important physiographic parameter is **channel slope *S ***or
> **watershed slope *S*~0~**, which reflects the rate of change of
> elevation with dis- tance along the main channel or within an overland
> flow area. Both slope measures are used in performing unit hydrograph,
> flood routing, and time- of-travel calculations. Slope estimates are
> used in several of the unit hydro- graph methods described later in
> this chapter. Field surveys or topographic maps, either paper or
> electronic, can be used to measure elevation changes so that watershed
> or channel slopes can be determined.
>
> **Soil types** in a watershed are critical, as they determine
> infiltration rates that can occur for the area. Soil properties can
> vary significantly across a watershed area, and the USDA Natural
> Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is responsible for developing
> soils maps to provide information on soil type, soil texture, and
> hydrologic soil groups. The three main soil classes are characterized
> by particle diameter *d* in mm, for sand, silt, and clay. Typical
> values are listed in Table 8--2 in Chapter 8. Soil texture is
> important in determining water-holding capacity and infiltration
> capacity of a soil layer. Thus, sands generally infiltrate water at a
> greater rate than do silts or clays. Of course, there can be mixtures
> of sizes, which can complicate the overall soil structure. The NRCS
> classified thousands of soils on the basis of runoff potential and
> grouped them into four hydrologic soil groups, A, B, C, and D. Type A
> infiltrates at the highest rate, D at the lowest. The relationship of
> soil type to infiltration capacity is presented in detail in Sec-
> tions 2.8 and 2.9.
>
> **Land use and land cover**, in the form of parking lots and urban
> develop- ment, can have profound effects on watershed response. In
> fact, many of the methods described later were developed to address
> urban development impacts in a watershed. For example, the **Rational
> Method** \[see Eq. (1--13)\] uses a coefficient *C* to reflect the
> runoff potential of a watershed. The value of *C* for commercial
> (0.75) is greater than residential (0.3), which is greater than
> forested (0.15), indicating that more intense development generates
>
> greater rates of runoff for the same rainfall (see Sections 6.4 and
> 9.3). Urban development is also characterized by the percent
> imperviousness, or paved area, which can range from 50% to 90% for
> commercial compared to 20% to 40% for residential areas (see Table
> 2--1). Several of the unit hydrograph methods (Section 2.3) contain
> parameters that relate to urban land use effects.

> **UNIT HYDROGRAPH**

**THEORY**

> Sherman (1932) originally advanced the theory of the unit hydrograph
> (UH), defined as "basin outflow resulting from 1.0 inch (1.0 mm) of
> direct runoff generated uniformly over the drainage area at a uniform
> rainfall rate during a specified period of rainfall duration." An
> important point here is that UH is composed of 1.0 inch of direct
> runoff, which is equivalent to 1.0 inch of net rainfall for a given
> duration, *D*, and therefore all losses to infiltration must be
> subtracted before computations. Several assumptions inherent in the
> unit hydrograph approach tend to limit its application for any given
> watershed (Johnstone and Cross, 1949):

1.  Rainfall excesses of equal duration are assumed to produce
    hydrographs with equivalent time bases regardless of the intensity
    of the rain.

2.  Direct runoff ordinates for a storm of given duration are assumed
    directly proportional to rainfall excess volumes. Thus, twice the
    rain- fall produces a doubling of hydrograph ordinates.

3.  The time distribution of direct runoff is assumed independent of
    antecedent precipitation.

4.  Rainfall distribution is assumed to be the same for all storms of
    equal duration, both spatially and temporally.

> The classic statement of unit hydrograph theory can be summarized
> briefly: The hydrologic system is linear and time invariant (Dooge,
> 1973). The linear assumption implies that complex storm hydrographs
> can be pro- duced by adding up individual unit hydrographs, adjusted
> for rainfall vol- umes and added and lagged in time. For example, a
> 2-inch rainfall in X hours will produce double the response of 1 inch
> falling in X hours over a given watershed. While the assumptions of
> linearity and time invariance are not strictly correct for every
> watershed, we adopt them as long as they are useful. Nonlinear
> examples exist in open-channel flow, laboratory runoff models, and
> actual watersheds.

> a rising limb, a crest segment, and a recession curve (see Fig.

> and **time to peak**, *t~p~*, are also illustrated. The main timing
> aspects of the hydrograph can be charac- terized by the following
> parameters:

1.  **Duration** of rainfall excess (*D*): the time from start to finish
    > of rain- fall excess.

2.  **Lag time** (*t~p~*): the time from the center of mass of rainfall
    > excess to the peak of the hydrograph.

3.  **Time of rise** (*T~R~*): the time from the start of rainfall
    > excess to the peak of the hydrograph.

4.  **Time of concentration** (*t~c~*): the time for a wave (of water)
    > to propa- gate from the most distant point in the watershed to the
    > outlet. One estimate is the time from the end of net rainfall to
    > the inflection point of the hydrograph.

5.  **Time base** (*T~b~*): the total duration of the DRO hydrograph.

> If rainfall--runoff data exist, it is useful to develop unit
> hydrographs from measured rainfall events and streamflow from gages in
> a defined water- shed. The following general rules should be observed
> in developing unit hydrographs from gauged watersheds:

1.  Storms should be selected with a simple structure with relatively
    > uniform spatial and temporal distributions.

2.  Watershed sizes should generally fall between 1.0 and 100 mi^2^ in
    > modern watershed analysis.

3.  Direct runoff should range from 0.5 to 2.0 in.

4.  Duration of rainfall excess *D* should be approximately 25% to 30%
    > of lag time *t~p~*.

5.  A number of storms of similar duration should be analyzed to obtain
    > an average unit hydrograph for that duration.

6.  Step 5 should be repeated for several rainfalls of different
    > duration.

> The following are the essential steps for developing a unit hydrograph
> from a single storm hydrograph (see Fig. 2--1 and Example 2--1):

1.  Analyze the hydrograph and separate base flow.

2.  Measure the total volume of DRO under the hydrograph and con- vert
    > this to inches (mm) over the watershed.

3.  Convert total rainfall to rainfall excess through infiltration
    > methods, such that rainfall excess = DRO, and evaluate duration
    > *D* of the rainfall excess that produced the DRO hydrograph.

4.  Divide the ordinates of the DRO hydrograph (Fig. 2--1(b)) by the
    > volume in inches (mm) and plot these results as the unit
    > hydrograph

> for the basin (Fig. 2--1(c)). The time base *T~b~* is assumed constant
> for storms of equal duration and thus it will not change.

5.  Check the volume of the unit hydrograph to make sure that it is 1.0
    in. (1.0 mm), and graphically adjust ordinates as required.

> Because of assumptions of linearity inherent in the UH development,

> violate linearity. If intensity variations are large over the
> long-duration storm, assumptions of linearity may be violated. Also,
> if storage effects in the water- shed are important, assumptions may
> be violated. For large watersheds (above 100--500 mi^2^), it is
> usually advisable to divide the watershed into a number of subareas so
> that individual UHs can be developed for each. Typ- ically, UH should
> not exceed areas of 5 to 10 sq mi.
>
> Amount of runoff and areal distribution of runoff can cause variations
> in the shape of the hydrograph. For large basins, it is usually best
> to develop UHs for subareas and then add and lag, or convolute, them
> together to gen- erate an overall hydrograph. Peaks of UHs derived
> from very small events are often lower than those derived from larger
> storms because of differences in interflow and channel flow times.
> Assumptions of linearity can usually be verified by comparing
> hydrographs from storms of various magnitudes. If nonlinearity does
> exist, then derived UHs should be used only for generating events of
> similar magnitude, and caution should be exercised in using unit
> hydrographs to extrapolate to extreme events. Despite these
> limitations, when unit hydrographs have been used in conjunction with
> modern flood routing methods, resulting flood prediction for small and
> large basins is quite accurate. Detailed applications of the unit
> hydrograph are presented later in this chapter and in Chapters 5 and
> 9.
>
> **S-Curve Method**
>
> A UH for a particular watershed is defined for a specific duration *D*
> of rainfall excess (RF~net~). The linear property of the UH can be
> used to gen- erate a UH of larger or smaller duration. For example,
> given a 1-hr UH for a particular watershed, a UH resulting from a 2-hr
> unit storm can be developed by adding two 1-hr UHs, the second one
> lagged by 1 hr, adding together the ordinates, and dividing the result
> by 2. In this way, the 1 in. of rainfall in 1 hr has been distributed
> uniformly over 2 hr in deriving the 2-hr UH (Fig. 2--2). This lagging
> procedure is restricted to integer multi- ples of the original
> duration. In the same way, the 3-hr UH results from adding and lagging
> three together and dividing the ordinates by 3 (see Example 2--3).
>
> The **S-curve method** allows construction of a UH of any duration.
> Assume that a UH of duration *D* is known and that we wish to generate
> a UH for the same watershed with duration *D*\'. The first step is to
> generate the S-curve hydrograph by adding a series of UHs of duration
> *D,* each lagged by time period *D*. This corresponds to the runoff
> hydrograph result- ing from a continuous rainfall excess intensity of
> 1 *D* in./hr, where *D* is measured in hours. Note that an equilibrium
> hydrograph (S-curve) results

> and is equivalent to a continuous rainfall intensity falling until
> inflow and outflow are equal.
>
> By shifting the S-curve in time by *D*\' hr and subtracting ordinates
>
> between the two S-curves, the resulting hydrograph (Fig. 2--3, curve
> b) must be due to rainfall of 1 *D* in./hr that occurs for *D*\' hr.
> Thus, to con- vert curve b to a UH, we must multiply all the
> hydrograph ordinates by *D D*\' resulting in the UH of duration *D*\'.
> A homework problem explores these calculations in detail. The
> procedure is ideally suited for an Excel spread sheet.
>
> **Unit Hydrograph Convolution**
>
> The real importance of the UH approach is demonstrated in the develop-
> ment of storm hydrographs due to an actual rainfall event over a
> watershed. UH ordinates *U~j~* are multiplied by rainfall excess
> *P~n~* and added and lagged in a sequence to produce a resulting storm
> hydrograph, which ideally can be done using available Excel
> spreadsheets. Hydrograph convolution, the procedure of deriving a
> storm hydrograph from a multiperiod rainfall excess, is illustrated in
> Example 2--2. For actual watersheds, these calcula- tions are almost
> always done in a hydrologic model such as HEC-HMS (see Chapter 5).
>
> Each unit hydrograph is added at the time corresponding to the rain-
> fall spike that produced a response. Base flow can be added to produce
> a
>
> realistic storm hydrograph if base flow values are available for the
> water- shed under study. Care should be taken in this calculation to
> ensure that the time increments of rainfall excess correspond exactly
> to the duration of the UH. For example, 1-hr time increments should be
> used with the 1-hr UH. The governing equation for the storm hydrograph
> in discrete form is called the **convolution equation**:

*n*

> *Q~n~* = a *P~i~U~n~*~-*i*+1~, (2--1)

> *i* = 1

> *Q~n~* = *P~n~U*~1~ + *P~n~*~-1~*U*~2~ + *P~n~*~-2~*U*~3~ + g +
> *P*~1~*U~j~*,
>
> where *Q~n~* is the storm hydrograph ordinate, *P~i~* is rainfall
> excess, and *U~j~* (*j* = *n* - *i* + 1) is the unit hydrograph
> ordinate. Periods of no rainfall can also be included, as shown in
> Example 2--2.

> **STORM HYDROGRAPH FROM THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH**

> Given the rainfall excess hyetograph and the 1-hr UH below, derive the
> storm hydrograph for the watershed using hydrograph convolution (add
> and lag). Compute the resulting storm hydrograph and assume no losses
> to infiltration or evapotranspiration.

>
> The first line of development was based on the rational method modi-
> fied to include the travel time to the outlet for a particular
> watershed. Clark (1945) assumed that watershed response would be given
> by routing the time-- area relationship through an element of linear
> storage (see Eq. 2--23), which tends to attenuate and time-lag the
> hydrograph. The Clark unit hydrograph is contained in HEC-HMS and is
> presented in detail later in this section and in Table 5--10. The
> second approach to UH development assumed mathe- matical
> representations for the shape of the UH. A useful approach was
> advanced by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS, 1964, 1986), based on
> mea- surements from thousands of small watershed areas, which
> represented a dimensionless UH of discharge vs. time by a gamma
> function (discussed later). Since volume is fixed, only one parameter
> is required to determine the entire UH, either the *t~p~* or the peak
> flow rate, *Q~p~*.
>
> In the late 1950s, both approaches began to converge after the impor-
> tant contributions of O'Kelly (1955) and Nash (1958, 1959). O'Kelly's
> work was based on replacing the time--area curve by a UH in the shape
> of an isosceles triangle. Empirical expressions were necessary to
> transform the methods of Clark (1945) into usable UH techniques for
> actual basins. John- stone and Cross (1949) proposed one of the first
> relationships for *t~c~*, the time of concentration in hours, defined
> earlier in the chapter.
>
> *t~c~* = 5.0(*L*\> 1*S*)^0.5^, (2--6)

> and for **storage delay time**, *K*, in hours,

> *K* = 1.5 + 90(*A*\>*LR*), (2--7)
>
> where *L* is the length of the main stream in mi, *A* is the area in
> mi^2^, *S* is the slope in ft/mi, and *R* is an overland slope factor.
>
> Hydrologists have realized that a number of parameters are important
> in determining the shape and timing of the UH for a watershed. The lag
> or time to peak *t~p~* and the time of concentration *t~c~* are often
> used (Fig. 2--1(a)). The time of rise *T~R~* measured from time zero
> to the hydrograph peak is sometimes used. The time base *T~b~* of the
> hydrograph is included to define the duration of direct runoff. These
> timing parameters must be statistically or theoretically related to
> watershed characteristics in developing a syn- thetic UH.
>
> The discharge parameter most often used is the peak discharge *Q~p~*.
> A **routing parameter** *K* is sometimes included when the hydrograph
> has been routed through a linear reservoir with storage delay time
> *K*. This tends to delay and attenuate the input hydrograph. Watershed
> parameters of most concern include area *A*, main channel length *L*,
> length to watershed centroid *L~c~*, and slope of main channel *S*
> (see Section 2.1 and Fig. 1--22).
>
> **Assumptions and Modifying Factors**
>
> Most synthetic UH methods assume that the UH of a basin represents the
> integrated effect of size, slope, shape, and storage characteristics.
> As long as these factors are constant between two basins and do not
> vary with time, the unit response will be identical for the two
> basins. For two basins of the same size, if the slope of one is
> greater or if the basin shape of one is more con- centrated (if the
> length/width ratio is lower), the shape of the hydrograph will shift,
> as shown by the shift from *a* to *b* in Figure 2--5. Storage
> character- istics of the basin relate to slope, soil type, topography,
> channel resistance, and shape. If upstream reservoir storage is
> combined with downstream chan- nelization, the UH may shift to curve
> *b* due to a more rapid rise time from concrete channels and less
> infiltration loss from urban development. Finally, if an elongated
> basin were fully developed, one might expect a shift to curve *c*,
> where time of rise is much shorter and peak flow is much greater than
> in the original UH, *a*. Such a case is shown in Figure 2--6 for a
> fully developed watershed, Brays Bayou in Houston, Texas. Original
> synthetic hydrograph methods generally do not consider urbanization
> effects, but more modern empirical formulas usually account for urban
> channels, percent impervious (paved) area, or percent storm-sewered
> area.

> Time (hr)
>
> Most of the methods for synthetic UHs relate lag time *t~p~* or time
> of rise *T~R~* of the hydrograph to measures of the length of the main
> channel and shape of the basin. Some methods also relate timing to the
> inverse of the slope of the main channel or land. Thus, the longer the
> basin and the smaller the slope, the greater the time of rise of the
> hydrograph, as expected. Fig- ure 1--19(a) (Chapter 1) shows the
> general effect of watershed shape and land use (i.e., elongated vs.
> concentrated) on UH response.
>
> A second relation is usually presented between peak flow *Q~p~* and
> area of basin, and between *Q~p~* and the inverse of the *t~p~* or
> *T~R~* of the hydrograph, thus indicating that larger areas produce
> higher *Q~p~*. From continuity, the higher the peak flow, the smaller
> *t~p~* must be to keep the volume of the unit
>
> hydrograph constant with 1.0 in. of direct runoff. This is easily seen
> by refer- ring to Figure 2--5, where curves *a*, *b*, and *c* are all
> unit hydrographs. The following sections describe a few of the more

> Once the three quantities *t~p~*, *Q~p~*, and *T~b~* are known, the UH

> **Clark UH Method**
>
> The Clark (1945) UH is based on the use of a watershed and is modeled
> as a linear channel in series with a linear reservoir to account for
> translation and attenuation, respectively. This conceptual model
> defines the outflow from the linear channel as inflow (*I~i~*) to the
> linear reservoir, and the outflow
>
> (*O~i~*) from the linear reservoir as the instantaneous unit
> hydrograph (IUH). The linear channel uses an area--time relationship
> (i.e., isochrones of travel time to the outlet of watershed), and it
> is used to estimate the time distribu- tion of runoff from the basin.
> Time of concentration is represented by the time of runoff from the
> most remote part of the basin to the outlet. The linear reservoir
> signifies the combining effects of storage and resistance from the
> basin. Hoggan (1997) described the Clark method in details using the
> concept of the instantaneous unit hydrograph. Derivation starts with
> the relationship between the reservoir outflow and the storage is
> expressed as
>
> *S~i~* = *RO~i~*, (2--23)
>
> where
>
> *S~i~* = storage at end of period *i*, *O~i~* = outflow during period
> *i*, *R* = storage coefficient.

>
> Two major parameters of the Clark unit hydrograph are the time of con-
> centration *T~c~* and the storage coefficient *R*, which is the slope
> of the storage-- outflow curve for the linear reservoir. *T~c~* and
> *R* values can usually be obtained
>
> from observed hydrographs for gaged basins: *T~c~* is estimated as the
> time from the end of a burst rainfall excess to the inflection point
> on the receding limb; *R* is estimated by dividing the direct-runoff
> discharge at the inflection point by the slope of the curve at that
> point. The inflection point means where inflow to the linear reservoir
> is zero. At the inflection point, the continuity equation can be

> *R* = -(*Oi* - *Oi* - 1)\>Δ*t*. (2--29)
>
> Equation (2--29) theoretically produces the value of *R* as the ratio
> between the average discharge at the inflection point and the negative
> slope of the hydrograph at this point (which is negative).
>
> For ungaged basins, *T~c~* is usually determined from an analysis of
> travel time in the basin or from regression relationships that have
> been developed for the region. Even though the storage coefficient
> (*R*) cannot be obtained from measurable watershed characteristics
> directly, many regression equa- tions have been developed from some
> regions. Because *T~c~* and *R* are inter- dependent, the combining
> variables, *T~c~* + *R* and *R* (*T~c~* + *R*) are always used in unit
> hydrograph computations. Thus, the Clark method is now called the TC
> and R method, and is routinely used in HEC-HMS models, as shown in
> Table 5--10.
>
> Once a UH of given duration based on known storms or synthetic methods
> has been developed for a particular basin under a given set of physio-
> graphic conditions, it can then be utilized for a number of hydrologic
> cal- culations (Fig. 2--9). Such hydrographs can be developed for
> almost any area where UH methods have been developed or by applying
> general methods such as SCS's or Snyder's. In particular, for a single
> basin area, the UH can be used with a given storm event to determine
> the storm hydrograph through the add-and-lag procedure. For complex
> watersheds of several subbasins:

1.  Design storm hydrographs for selected recurrence-interval storms
    (10-yr, 25-yr, 100-yr) can be developed through convolution (adding
    and lagging) procedures for a given watershed area (Fig. 2--9(a)).

2.  Effects of land use changes, channel modifications, storage
    additions, and other variables can be tested to determine changes in
    the UH (Fig. 2--9).

3.  Storm hydrographs for each subbasin can be simulated by adding,
    > lagging, and routing the flows produced by unit hydrographs
    > through channel reaches (Chapter 4). Effects of various rainfall
    > pat- terns and land use distributions can be tested on overall
    > hydrologic response of the large watershed (Fig. 2--9(b)), as
    > demonstrated in Example 2--7.

4.  Storage routing methods (Chapter 4) can be used to translate inflow
    > UHs through a reservoir or detention basin of particular size to
    > attenuate peak flow or lag time to the peak of the hydrograph.
    > This is used for analysis of flood control options.

> **HYDROGRAPH CONVOLUTION**
>
> Given UH~1~ and UH~2~ for two subareas of a watershed that meet at
> conflu- ence point *A*; use the 10-yr 6-hr design rainfall for Houston
> (Fig. 1--15) to find the resulting storm hydrograph at the point of
> confluence. Use hydrograph convolution (add and lag). Assume
> infiltration losses are
>
> 0.15 in. for the first hour and 0.1 in./hr thereafter. Estimate the
> area of subarea 1. Figure E2--7 shows the watershed.

**HYDROLOGIC**

> **LOSS--- EVAPORATION**

**AND ET**

> **Introduction to Evaporation**
>
> Evaporation is the process by which water in its liquid or solid state
> is trans- formed into water vapor, which as a gas mixes with the
> atmosphere. Evapo- transpiration (*ET*) is considered separately as
> the combined loss of water vapor from the surface of plants
> (transpiration) and the evaporation of mois- ture from soil. Knowledge
> of evaporation processes is important in predict- ing water losses to
> evaporation from a lake or reservoir. On average, approximately 70% of
> the mean annual rainfall in the United States is returned to the
> atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration. However, vari- ations in
> evaporation across the continent can be very large due to effects of
> solar input, location of mountains, and proximity to oceans. On an
> annual basis, evaporation rates can exceed mean annual rainfall,
> especially in arid regions of the southwest. For example, arid areas
> in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and southern California can
> exceed 70 in. per year, com- pared to about 30 to 40 in. per year for
> much of the rest of the country.
>
> For the case of evaporation from a lake surface, water loss is a
> function of solar radiation, temperature of the water and air,
> difference in vapor pres- sure between water and the overlying air,
> and wind speed across the lake. As evaporation proceeds in a
> closed-container system at a constant tem- perature, pressure in the
> air space increases because of an increase in partial pressure of
> water vapor. Evaporation continues until vapor pressure of the
> overlying air equals the surface vapor pressure; at this point, the
> air space is said to be saturated at that temperature, and further
> evaporation ceases. This state of equilibrium would not be reached if
> the container were open to the atmosphere, in which case all water
> would eventually evaporate. Ther- mal energy is required to increase
> the free energy of water molecules to allow escape across the
> liquid--gas interface. The amount of heat required to convert water to
> vapor at constant temperature (597 cal/g at 0°C) is called the latent
> heat of evaporation, as given in Equation (1--5).
>
> As vaporization continues over a flat free-water surface, an accumula-
> tion of vapor molecules causes an increase in the vapor pressure *e*
> in the air just above the water surface, until eventually condensation
> begins. The air is saturated when the rate of condensation equals the
> rate of vaporization and *e* equals the saturation vapor pressure.
> However, various convective transport processes operate to transport
> the vapor (by wind-driven currents) and prevent equilibrium from
> occurring.
>
> Evaporation is important in the long-term water balance and is usually
> of concern for large-scale water resources planning and water supply
> studies. Dur- ing typical storm periods, with intensities of 0.5
> in./hr, evaporation is on the order of 0.01 in./hr and is normally
> neglected for flood flow studies and urban drainage design
> applications. Evaporation has been extensively studied in the United

> **Water Budget Method for Determining Evaporation**
>
> The water budget method for lake evaporation is based on the
> continuity equation. Assuming that change in storage Δ*S*, surface
> inflow *I*, surface out- flow *O*, subsurface seepage to ground water
> flow *GW*, and precipitation *P* can be measured, evaporation *E* can
> be computed as
>
> *E* = - Δ*S* + *I* + *P* - *O* - *GW*. (2--33)
>
> The approach is simple in theory, but evaluating seepage terms can
> make the method quite difficult to implement. The obvious problems
> result from errors in measuring precipitation, inflow, outflow, change
> in storage, and subsurface seepage. Good estimates using the method
> were obtained for Lake Hefner, near Oklahoma City, with 5% to 10%
> error. It should be emphasized that Lake Hefner was selected from more
> than one hundred lakes and reservoirs as one of three or four that
> best met water budget requirements and had minimal seepage losses to
> the subsurface.
>
> **Mass Transfer Method**
>
> Mass transfer techniques are based primarily on the concept of
> turbulent transfer of water vapor from a water surface to the
> atmosphere. Numerous empirical formulas have been derived to express
> evaporation rate as a function of vapor-pressure differences and wind
> speed above a lake or reservoir. Many such equations can be written in
> the form of a diffusive flux of water vapor, whose concept dates back
> to Dalton's original theories (Brutsaert, 1982):
>
> *E* = (*e~s~* - *e~a~*)(*a* + *bu*), (2--34)
>
> where
>
> *e~s~* = saturation vapor pressure at the *T~s~* of the water surface,
>
> *e~a~* = vapor pressure at some fixed level above the water surface,
> the product of relative humidity times saturation vapor pressure at
> *T~a~* of the air,
>
> = wind speed,
>
> *a*, *b* = empirical constants.
>
> An obstacle to comparing different evaporation formulas is the vari-
> ability in measurement heights for *u* and *e~a~*. Reducing all
> formulas to the same measurement level of 2 m (6.5 ft) for wind speed
> and vapor pressure and taking into account the 30% difference between
> reservoir and pan evap- oration, the scatter between the common
> formulas is considerably reduced. The formula with the best database
> is the Lake Hefner formula given by Marciano and Harbeck (1954), which
> also performed well at Lake Mead (Harbeck, 1958). Some formulas use a
> zero value of the constant *a* in Equa- tion (2--34), due probably to
> small local air movements with velocities insuf- ficient to remove
> excess vapor from above a pan surface. Harbeck and Meyers (1970)
> present the formula

>
> *e*~2~ = vapor pressure 2 m above water surface (mb),
>
> *u*~2~ = wind speed 2 m above the water surface (m/s).
>
> **Energy Budget Method**
>
> The most accurate and complex method for determining evaporation uses
> the energy budget of a lake (Fig. 2--13). The overall energy budget

> refilled when the depth has fallen to 7 in. The water surface level is
> measured daily, and evaporation is computed as the
>
> difference between observed levels, adjusted for any precipitation
> measured in a standard rain gage. Alternatively, water is added each
> day to bring the level up to a fixed point. Pan evaporation rates are
> higher than actual lake evapora- tion and must be adjusted to account
> for radiation and heat-exchange effects. The adjustment factor is
> called the pan coefficient, which ranges from 0.64 to
>
> 0.81 and averages 0.70 for the United States. However, the pan
> coefficient var- ies with season, exposure, and climatic conditions
> and should be used only for rough estimates of lake evaporation. Pan

> **Evapotranspiration**

For a water budget over the whole watershed, one is usually concerned
with the total evaporation from all free-water surfaces, plus
**transpiration**, the loss of vapor through small openings (stomata) in
plant tissue (e.g., leaves). For most plants, transpiration occurs only
during daylight hours during photo- synthesis, which can lead to diurnal
variations in the shallow ground water table in heavily vegetated areas.
The combined evaporation and transpira- tion loss is called
**evapotranspiration (ET)** and is a maximum if the water supply to both
the plant and soil surface is unlimited. The maximum possible loss is
limited by meteorological conditions and is called **potential ET**
(Thornthwaite, 1948); potential ET is approximately equal to the
evapora- tion from a large, free-water surface such as a lake. Thus,
methods discussed in the previous section for evaporation can be used to
predict potential ET. Large surface area and high temperature of leaves
can easily create transpiration rates that equal or even exceed
potential ET. Exceedance is possible in instances of an "oasis" of
well-watered vegetation, such as a crop or golf course, located in a
larger area in which actual ET is less than the potential. Actual
transpiration and, hence, actual ET are usually lim- ited by moisture
supply to the plants. Obviously the effect of limited mois- ture will
depend on plant characteristics such as root depth and the ability of
the soil to transport water to the roots. These effects have led to
various empirical factors that may be applied to potential ET, computed
using one of the evaporation methods discussed previously. For example,
Penman (1950) determined that ET from a vegetated land surface in Great
Britain was 60% to 80% of potential ET computed using his method; Shih
et al. (1983) used a value of 70% for crops in southern Florida. On the
other hand, Priestly and Taylor (1972) multiplied Penman equation
evaporation by 1.26 for well-watered crops to compute ET. Other
empirical formulas

1.  The soil under consideration is homogeneous and stable, implying
    that macropores and preferential migration pathways should not be
    considered.

2.  The supply of ponded water at the surface is not limited (an assump-
    tion subject to modification below).

3.  A distinct and precisely definable wetting front exists, and as
    > water continues to infiltrate, the wetting front advances at the
    > same rate with depth.

4.  The capillary suction just below the wetting front is uniform
    > through- out the profile and constant in time during the
    > infiltration event.

5.  The soil is uniformly saturated above the wetting front, and the
    > vol- umetric water contents remain constant above and below the
    > advanc- ing wetting front.

> At the wetting front, the average capillary suction head c is used to

    Remem- bering that the hydraulic conductivity that transmits water
    downward based on the hydrostatic pressure is accompanied by the
    suction head, c, which pulls water downward into unsaturated soil,
    Equation (2--52) indicates that the infiltration rate is a value
    greater than the saturated hydraulic conductiv- ity as long as there
    is sufficient water at the surface for infiltration, as sketched in
    curves B--C and D of Figure 2--19c. The infiltration rate decreases
    as the cumulative infiltration increases.

> Solution of the Green and Ampt equation requires the estimation of
> three parameters: the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity
> (*K~s~*), the moisture deficit (*M~d~*), and the wetting front suction

> water flow (the porosity minus the thin film of water surrounding all

> Three rainfall-infiltration scenarios are possible:
>
> **Case 1: *i ***\* ***K~s~*.** The rainfall intensity is less than the

> **SNOWFALL AND SNOWMELT**
>
> A small percentage (about 13%) of precipitation over the entire U.S.
> falls as snow, but it can be a dominant source of streamflow,
> especially in mountain- ous areas during spring melt. This is
> certainly true of the western United States, but significant
> percentages of runoff in the northeast and midwest also originate as
> snow. Because the storage and melting of snow play an important role
> in the hydrologic cycle of some areas, hydrologists must be able to
> reliably predict the contribution of snowmelt to overall runoff.
> Because snowmelt begins in the spring and the derived runoff is out of
> phase with periods of greatest water demand, control schemes such as
> storage res- ervoirs have been implemented in many areas for water
> supply. Under cer- tain conditions, snowmelt can also contribute to
> flooding problems, especially in larger river basins with mountainous
> areas. In addition to forecasting flood situations, snowmelt
> predictions are also valuable to power companies that generate
> hydroelectricity and to irrigation districts.
>
> Because of the range of uses for estimating the contribution of snow-
> melt to streamflow and the variation of conditions applicable to each
> case, many methods have been developed for computing snowmelt as it
> affects streamflow. These methods have consistently found that the
> timing and
>
> amount of runoff depend mainly on three factors: the energy of a
> snowpack available for melt, the areal extent of the melting
> snowcover, and the effects of storage on the movement of the meltwater
> (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Snow measurements are obtained using standard and recording rain
> gages, snow stakes, and snow boards, which measure accumulation over a
> period of time. Snow surveys at a number of spaced points along a snow
> course are necessary to account for drifting and blowing snow. The
> Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) uses devices called snow
> pillows, which continuously record and transmit the pressure from snow
> at the bottom of a snowpack. The NRCS has about 500 telemetry sites
> ("SNOTEL" sites) throughout the western United States transmitting
> data from snow pillows.
>
> The distribution of mean annual snowfall in the United States is quite
> variable, and errors may be large in mountainous regions because of
> the lack of measurements in remote areas. There is a gradual increase
> in snowfall with latitude and elevation, and from 400 to 500 in./yr
> (\~1000 cm/yr) can occur in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range of the
> western United States. Large snows
>
> can also occur near the Great Lakes, with average values over 100 in.
> (254 cm).
>
> **Physics of Snowmelt**
>
> The energy exchanged between the snowpack, the atmosphere, and the
> earth's surface is the controlling factor in rates of snowmelt. Other
> geo- graphic, topographic, and surface cover factors are also
> important. Density of snow is a major aspect of predicting runoff and
> is determined by several factors. Snow that is formed under dry, cold
> conditions will be less dense than snow formed under wet and warmer
> conditions. As snow accumulates on the ground over a period of time,
> its density increases with the settling and compaction due to factors
> such as wind. Wind increases the density of snow in two ways: First,
> the turbulence breaks ice crystals into smaller ones, making them
> settle more compactly, and second, drag forces are exerted on the
> surface of snow due to the moving air and particles. Newly fallen snow
> has a density about 10% that of liquid water, but the density can
> increase to 50% with aging. The depth of water that would result if
> all the snow melted is called the **snow water equivalent, SWE**, and
> is given by the equation
>
> SWE = 0.01 *d~s~*r*~s~*, (2--55)
>
> where SWE is in mm, snowdepth *d~s~* is in cm, and r*~s~* is in
> kg/m^3^. The density of snow is often assumed to be 100 kg/m^3^. Hence
> a rule of thumb for new snow is that the depth of water equivalent is
> approximately 1/10 the depth of the snowpack. *Ripe snow* holds all
> the liquid water it can against the action of gravity. If a snowpack
> is ripe, additional rain can not only result in runoff itself but also
> warm the snow due to the release of the latent heat when the rain
> fuses with the pack (Male and Gray, 1981). Hence, any heat added to
> ripe snow will produce runoff. Heat added to a snowpack at a
> temperature below freezing will act to warm it.
>
> Snowmelt and evaporation are both thermodynamic processes and can be
> studied with an energy-balance approach. The energy for snowmelt is
> derived from the following: (1) net solar radiation, (2) net longwave
> radia- tion exchange (from atmosphere and clouds), (3) conduction
> (diffusion) and convection transfer of sensible heat to or from the
> overlying air, (4) conden- sation of water vapor from the overlying
> air, (5) conduction from the under- lying soil, and (6) heat supply by
> incident rainfall. The heat exchange at the snow--air interface
> dominates the snowmelt process, and heat exchange with the soil is
> secondarily important.
>
> For each gram of water melted in a snowpack at 0°C (32°F), 80 cal/g of
> latent heat must be supplied. Thus, if the density of water is 1 g/cm,
> 80 cal will melt 80 cm^3^ (water equivalent) of snow. Hence, 80 ly
> (cal/cm^2^) are required to melt 1 cm depth of snow. Meltwater may
> refreeze with cooling, or it may drain from the snowpack, contributing
> to soil moisture, streamflow, or ground water recharge. Snowmelt
> computations are made difficult by the variations in solar radiation
> received by the surface and variations in the **albedo**, the
> reflection coefficient equal to the ratio of reflected to incident
> shortwave radiation.
>
> Although only 5% to 10% of incoming shortwave radiation is reflected
> by a water surface, up to 83% is reflected by a clean, dry snow
> surface. As the snow ages, its albedo can drop to less than 50%
> because of structural changes, and shortwave radiation penetrates to
> varying depths, depending on snow density. New precipitation affects
> the albedo of a snowpack: A snowfall increases the albedo to 0.8 and
> rain reduces it to 0.4 (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Snow radiates essentially as a black body (emissivity = 0.97)
> according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and outgoing longwave radiation
> at 0°C is equivalent to 8.4 cm (3.3 in.) of melt over a one-day
> period. Because of re- radiation from the atmosphere back to the
> earth, longwave radiation loss is equivalent to only about 2 cm (0.8
> in.) of melt per day under clear skies and near-freezing temperatures.
>
> Heat exchange between a snowpack and the atmosphere is affected by
> conduction, convection, condensation, and evaporation (Anderson, 1976;
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1956). However, very little evaporation
> from snow occurs. Direct transformation of snow (ice) to vapor, known
> as *sublimation,* is an important part of the water balance in the
> Arctic. Wind velocity and air temperature are primary factors
> affecting the density of new snow. The rate of transfer of sensible
> heat (convection) is proportional to the temperature difference
> between the air *T~a~* and the snow *T~s~* and to the wind velocity
> *v.* Condensation melt is proportional to the vapor-pressure
> difference between the snow surface and the atmosphere and to the wind
> velocity. The transfer of heat from the underlying soil to the
> snowpack is small on a daily basis but may accumulate to several
> centimeters of melt during an entire season. This may be enough to
> keep the soil saturated and to produce a rapid response of runoff when
> melting occurs. Raindrop temperature is reduced as it enters a
> snowpack, and an equivalent amount of heat is imparted to the snow
> based on the surface wet-bulb temperature. For example, the heat
> available in 10 mm of rain at 10°C will melt about 1.2 mm of water
> from the snowpack.
>
> In many basins of very high relief, the lower limit of snowcover (the
> snow line) is dynamic and moves up and down the slope. As melting pro-
> ceeds, snowcover recedes more rapidly on southerly and barren slopes,
> with the rate of snowmelt decreasing with elevation. Given the
> temperature at an index station, an area--elevation curve for the
> basin, and the average snow- line elevation, one can compute the area
> subject to melting based on the rate of change of temperature with
> elevation, typically about 1°C per 100 m (5°F per 1000 ft) increase in
> elevation.
>
> **The Snowpack Energy Budget**
>
> The snowpack energy budget is written in terms of the energy flux to
> and from the snowpack, with units of energy per unit area per unit
> time. The most convenient units for *Q* are cal/cm^2^-day (ly/day). In
> terms of the energy budget components mentioned earlier,

Δ*H*\>Δ*t* = *Q~N~* + *Q~g~* + *Q~c~* + *Q~e~* + *Q~p~*, (2--56)

> where
>
> Δ*H* = change in heat storage in snowpack,
>
> *Q~N~* = net (incoming minus reflected minus outgoing) shortwave and
> longwave radiation,
>
> *Q~g~* = conduction of heat to snowpack from underlying ground,
>
> *Q~c~* = convective transport of sensible heat from air to snowpack
> (negative if from snowpack to air),
>
> *Q~e~* = release of latent heat of vaporization by condensation of
> water vapor onto snowpack,
>
> *Q~p~* = advection of heat to snowpack by rain.
>
> If the change in storage is positive, it will act either to warm the
> snow, or to ripen the snow, or to produce melt. These are the three
> phases of snow melt, though they do not always occur in clear, steady
> sequence (Dingman, 2002). Detailed computation of net shortwave and
> longwave radiation is discussed in detail in Gray and Prowse, (1993).
> Convective heat transport and con- densation melt are both diffusive
> processes; the heat flux is proportional to the gradient of
> temperature for the former and to the gradient of vapor pressure for
> the latter. Diffusivities or transfer coefficients are functions of
> wind velocity and surface roughness. Heat transfer to or from the
> ground *Q~g~* is usually neglected unless the snowpack and ground
> surface tempera- tures are both known. Heat advected by rain into the
> snowpack is simply proportional to the difference between the rain
> temperature (usually as- sumed equal to the wet-bulb temperature) and
> the temperature of the snow.
>
> Using a given time duration and the sum of energy budget components in
> ly/day (*Q*~1~ + *Q*~2~ + *Q*~3~ + g), missing variables such as water
> output can be found from equations for heat storage change (Δ*H*) (see
> Dingman, 2002, for examples). The equations for each phase of snowpack
> development (warming, ripening, and melting) are similar to those of
> simple melting ice.

> *h~s~* is the depth of the snow, and *L* is the latent heat of fusion

>
> **Degree-Day or Temperature-Index Melt Equations**
>
> Degree-day or temperature-index equations are empirical or can result
> from a linearization of the energy budget equation (Huber and
> Dickinson, 1988). The simplest equation used is
>
> *M* = *D~f~* (*T~i~* - *T~B~*), (2--61)

> *M* = daily melt as a depth of water equivalent (in./day; mm/day),
>
> *T~i~* = index air temperature (°F; °C),
>
> *T~B~* = base melt temperature (°F; °C),
>
> *D~f~* = degree-day melt factor, (in./day-°F; mm/day-°C).
>
> Empirical degree-day factors range from 0.05 to 0.15 in./day-°F and
> can be determined by several equations, one of the simplest being
>
> *D~f~* = 0.011r*~s~*, (2--62)
>
> where *D~f~* is in units of mm/day-°C above 0°C and r*~s~* is the snow
> density in kg/ m^3^. This factor is affected by location, time of
> year, and meteorological condi- tions, and more complex equations may
> take into account vegetation transmis- sion for radiation, solar
> radiation, and snow albedo (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Equation (2--61) is basically a regression equation; ACOE (1956)
> results are shown in Figure 2--20. Either the maximum or average daily
> tem- perature for the portion over 0°C is usually used for the index
> air tempera- ture *T~i~*, and 0°C is most commonly used for *T~B~*
> (Gray and Prowse, 1993). However, base melt temperatures can be below
> freezing, since Equation (2--62) represents a linearization about

> variables of the energy-balance and temper- ature-index models
> (Dingman, 2002). The final results show good accuracy for both models,
> although some years favored one over the other. During the melting
> phase, Anderson closely matched both snow--water equivalent (SWE) over
> time and daily water output with lysimeter and visual observation
> data. Although both models worked well, each requires detailed
> knowledge of the local environment and changes in conditions. The

> **Computation of Runoff from Snowmelt**
>
> Synthesis of runoff hydrographs associated with snowmelt can be short
> term, for a few days, or long term, for a complete melt season.
> Short-term forecast- ing is used in preparing operational plans for
> reservoirs or other flood con- trol works and for calculating design
> floods. To forecast a few days in advance, only the present condition
> of a snowpack and stream flow are required. Programs used to predict
> runoff from snowmelt include the ACOE Streamflow Synthesis and
> Reservoir Regulation (SSARR) and the U.S. NWS River Forecasting
> System, Snow Accumulation and Ablation Model. For long-term
> forecasting over a whole season, initial conditions are required as
> well as reliable predictions of meteorologic parameters.
>
> Snowmelt occurs only from those portions of a watershed covered by
> snow, and elevation is significant, since rates of snowmelt generally
> decrease with higher elevation due to a general reduction in
> temperature. Elevation effects can be considered by dividing a basin
> into a series of elevation zones, where the snow depth, losses, and
> snowmelt are assumed uniform in each. In most practical cases,
> snowmelt is estimated by the index methods presented in the previous
> section. The budget method itself is used in design flood studies.
> Once inflow water has been calculated, storage routing techniques are
> used to accommodate surface and ground water components, each with a
> different storage time and number of routing units. Storage routing
> methods are treated in detail in Chapter 4.
>
> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 2 presents the concept of rainfall--runoff analysis, or the
> conversion of pre- cipitation to runoff or streamflow, a central
> problem of engineering hydrology. Gross rainfall must be adjusted for
> losses to infiltration, evaporation, and depression stor- age to
> obtain rainfall excess, which equals direct runoff (DRO).
>
> The UH is defined as 1 in. (1 mm) of direct runoff generated uniformly
> over a basin for a specified period of rainfall and is a powerful
> method still used for many watershed studies. The concept of the UH
> allows for the conversion of rainfall ex- cess into a basin
> hydrograph, through a linear adding and lagging procedure called
> hydrograph convolution.
>
> UHs can be derived from actual storm data for gauged basins. Synthetic
> UHs represent theoretical or empirical approaches that can be applied
> to ungaged basins. These are most often used for the analysis of
> watersheds where limited gauging might exist. Most synthetic UH
> formulas relate parameters such as time to peak or lag time to
> measures of channel length, slope, watershed size, and watershed
> shape. A second rela- tion usually correlates peak flow to basin area
> and lag time. UHs are greatly affected by urban development and
> channelization, and UH techniques have been customized for local or
> regional conditions using statistical methods (Chapter 3). Several of
> the more popular UH methods are presented with examples, including
> Snyder, SCS, and Clark (TC & R), all contained within the HEC-HMS
> computer model (Chapter 5).
>
> Kinematic wave methods developed in the 1970s for overland flow hydro-
> graphs and channel hydrographs were based on solutions of the
> continuity and Man- ning's equation for a given geometry. Kinematic
> wave methods are now more useful with the current popularity of
> numerical methods and advanced hydrologic models, which include
> HEC-HMS from the U.S. ACOE Hydrologic Engineering Center (2006, 2010)
> and distributed hydrologic models (Vieux, 2002).
>
> Hydrologic losses are covered in detail in Chapter 2, including
> evaporation and ET for water bodies and vegetated surfaces. The Penman
> equation is presented along with a detailed example of its use.
> Infiltration loss is presented using both simple empiri- cal methods
> such as Horton and more physics-based methods such as Green and Ampt.
> Several examples and homework problems are included to cover these
> methods in detail. Chapter 2 also presents snowfall and snowmelt
> theory as it relates to the rain- fall--runoff process. The physics of
> snowmelt is briefly covered, and energy budget and empirical
> degree-day equations are shown that can be used to estimate melt rates
> in in./day or cm/day as a function of air temperature, snow
> temperature, and other fac- tors. Snowmelt can be a significant factor

> **CONCEPT CHECK**

1.  What characterizes a watershed?

2.  Describe the four assumptions made that are inherent to the unit
    hydrograph.

3.  What physical factors affect the shape and timing of the unit
    hydrograph?

4.  Discuss the parameters that describe the main timing aspects of the
    hydrograph.

5.  What two characteristics of the hydrograph do most methods for the
    synthetic unit hydrographs relate?

6.  In order to determine which of the three excavation sites could have
    potentially contributed to the sedimentation of the three lakes, it
    is necessary to determine the watershed boundaries and the
    contributing drainage areas of the system of lakes. Catchment basins
    (watersheds) can be determined by connecting ridge lines and
    dividing lines. Ridge lines will follow the elevation isocontours,
    and dividing lines are perpendicular to the elevation isocontours at
    the end and start at the confluences of streams. Using the map on
    the textbook website displaying the elevation data, determine the
    following:

    a.  How many confluences are displayed on the map?

    b.  Delineate the watersheds using the elevation isocontours. The
        total drainage area of the study area is approximately 238
        acres.

    c.  Determine which of the three lakes may be affected by
        accelerated sedimentation.

    d.  Determine which of the three excavation sites may be responsible
        for the accelerated sedimentation of the lakes.

7.  A watershed has the following characteristics:

> *A* = 2600 ac
>
> *L* = 5 mi.
>
> *S* = 53 ft/mi.
>
> *y* = 40%
>
> The channel is lined with concrete.
>
> The watershed is a residential area with 1/4-ac lots. The soil is
> categorized as soil group B. Assume that the average watershed slope
> is the same as the chan- nel slope. Determine the UH for this area for
> a storm duration of 1 hr using the SCS triangular UH method.

8.  Determine the storm hydrograph resulting from the rainfall pattern
    in Figure P2--8a using the triangular 1-hr UH given in Figure
    P2--8b.

a.  Using storm hydrograph, estimate the vol of runoff in inches over
    the watershed.

b.  Estimate the vol of infiltration (in.).

c.  Estimate tp for the entire event.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
12. Plot the hydrograph for the storm data given in Problem 1.22 (flow
    > rate vs. time). Label the following:

    a.  peak flow *Q~p~*,

    b.  time to peak *t~p~* (distance from the center of mass of
        > rainfall to the peak flow),

    c.  time of rise *T~R~* (distance from the start of discharge to the
        > peak flow),

    d.  time base *T~B~* (distance from the start of discharge to the
        > end of discharge).

13. Using the convolution equation, develop a storm hydrograph for the
    > rainfall intensity *i* and infiltration *f* given in the table (at
    > the end of each time step) using the 30-min unit hydrograph U
    > given below.

> Unit hydrograph for Subbasin C.

20. Redo Example 2--6 if the watershed is soil type B in good cover
    forest land. How does the forested area compare to the meadow UH?

21. Sketch the SCS triangular and curvilinear UHs and the mass curve for
    a 100-mi^2^ watershed which is 60% good condition meadow and 40%
    good cover forest land. The watershed consists of 70% soil group C
    and 30% soil group A. The average slope is 100 ft/mi, the rainfall
    duration is 3 hr, and the length to divide is 18 mi.

22. A small watershed has the characteristics given below. Find the peak
    discharge *Q~p~*, the basin lag time *t~p~*, and the time base of
    the unit hydrograph *T~b~*~,~ using Snyder's method.

> A = 200 mi.^2^; *C~t~* = 1.70; L = 27 mi.; L*~c~* = 15 mi.; C*~p~* =
> 0.7

23. For a 55 mi^2^ watershed with *C~t~* = 2.2, L = 15 mi., *L~c~* = 7
    mi., and *C~p~* = 0.5, find

> *t~p~*, *Q~p~*, *T~b~*, and D. Plot the resulting Snyder UH.

24. Watershed data are provided on Figure 1--22 for a small forested
    watershed that contains seven subareas as shown. Compute an SCS UH
    (dimensionless) for subarea B, based on lengths and areas from the
    watershed. Assume a wa- tershed slope of 0.5% and a CN = 70.

25. Assume the watershed in Example 2--5 has gone through extensive
    commercial and industrial growth on the wooded area. Now 50% of the
    formerly wooded areas have become urbanized, so of that portion, 40%
    is commercial and busi- ness and 60% is fair condition lawn space.
    Assume the soil is 50% group B and 50% group C for all areas. Using
    Figure 2--8, determine the runoff volume for a rainfall of 6 in.

26. Make sure that the unit hydrograph for subbasin C is a unit
    hydrograph (sub- basin C area = 770 ac). The unit hydrograph for
    subbasin C is graphed in Figure P2--27.

28. Using Figure 2--14, find the daily evaporation from a shallow lake
    > with the following characteristics:

> Mean daily temperature = 25.6°C, Daily solar radiation = 550
> cal/cm^2^,
>
> Mean daily dew point = 4.4°C,
>
> Wind movement (6 in. above pan) = 5.5 ft/s.

29. A class A pan is maintained near a small lake to determine daily
    evaporation (see table). The level in the pan is observed at the end
    of everyday. Water is added if the level falls *near* 7 in. For each
    day the difference in height level is calculated between the current
    and previous day, and the precipitation value is from the current
    day. Determine the daily lake evaporation if the pan coefficient is
    0.70.

30. Given an initial rate of infiltration equal to 1.5 in./hr and a
    final capacity of 0.5 in./hr, use Horton's equation \[Eq. (2--42)\]
    to find the infiltration capacity at the following times: *t* = 10
    min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 6 hr. You may assume a
    time constant *k* = 0.25/hr.

32. A 5-hr storm over a 15-ac basin produces a 5-in. rainfall: 1.2
    in./hr for the first hour, 2.1 in./hr for the second hour, 0.9
    in./hr for the third hour, and 0.4 in./hr for the last 2 hr.

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> **Scope of the Chapter**
>
> Many processes in hydrology must be analyzed and explained in a
> probabi- listic sense because of their inherent randomness. For
> instance, it is not pos- sible to predict streamflow and rainfall on a
> purely deterministic basis in either the past (hindcasting) or the
> future (forecasting), since it is impossible to know all their causal
> mechanisms quantitatively. Fortunately, statistical methods are
> available to organize, present, and reduce observed data to a form
> that facilitates their interpretation and evaluation. This chapter
> pres- ents methods by which the uncertainty in hydrologic data may be
> quantified and presented in a standard probabilistic framework. The
> primary objective is to relate the magnitude of a hydrologic event,
> such as a flood, to its prob- ability and vice versa. Within this
> chapter, the word "flood" is used generi- cally to mean the magnitude
> of a hydrologic event. Although actual flood data are used in
> examples, the same techniques may be applied to precipita- tion and
> many other hydrologic variables.
>
> **174**
>
> **Random Variables**
>
> A random variable is a parameter (e.g., streamflow, rainfall, stage)
> that can- not be predicted with certainty; that is, a random variable
> is the outcome of a random or uncertain process. Such variables may be
> treated statistically as either **discrete** or **continuous**. Most
> hydrologic data are continuous and are analyzed probabilistically
> using continuous frequency distributions. For example, values of flow
> in the hydrograph sketched in Figure 3--1(a) can equal any positive
> real number to the accuracy of the flow meter; that is, the data are
> continuous. However, the data themselves are often presented in a
> discrete form because of the measurement process. For example, daily
> streamflows might be estimated to the nearest cfs. This form of data
> presen- tation is called **quantized continuous**; that is, the
> continuous observations are assigned to discrete ranges. This is also
> illustrated in Figure 3--1(a), in which flows are assigned to the
> nearest cfs.
>
> Discrete random variables can take on values only from a specified
> domain of discrete values. For example, flipping a coin will produce
> either a head or a tail; rolling a die produces an integer from 1 to
> 6. The output from a tipping-bucket rain gage is a hydrologic example
> (Fig. 3--1(b)): There either is

> or is not a tip during any time interval. Quantized-continuous data
> could be treated as discrete; indeed, they are discretized whenever
> tabulated data are processed, since numerical values must be truncated
> (e.g., to the gage accuracy for flow or to the nearest 0.01 in. for
> rainfall). However, for frequency analysis this is usually very
> inconvenient because of the enormous range of values that would have
> to be considered. For example, if streamflows are measured to the
> nearest cfs and there is a range of flows from 0 to 5000 cfs, then
> 5000 discrete intervals would have to be considered. Approximating the
> record as continuous is much easier. Although discrete frequency
> distributions are sometimes applied to continuous variables (e.g.,
> storm rainfall depths), most applications of discrete distributions in
> hydrology are to a random variable that represents the *number* of
> events satisfying a certain criterion---for example, the number of
> floods expected to exceed a certain magnitude during a period of
> years.
>
> **Presentation of Data**
>
> A key assumption of frequency analysis is that the data are
> **independent**; that is, the magnitude of a future event does not
> depend upon the magnitude of past events. While underlying
> climatological mechanisms in hydrology, such as the El Niño--Southern
> Oscillation (ENSO), may affect long-term flow records, climatological
> cause-and-effect mechanisms are difficult to quantify (Tootle et al.,
> 2005). A qualitative judgment regarding the presence of a nonrandom
> pattern in the time series of hydrologic data can often be made on the
> basis of a plot of the time series (a time series is a record of
> magnitude vs. the time at which it occurs). For instance, a 75-yr
> record of the Siletz River near the western Oregon coast is shown in
> Figure 3--2. A 5-yr running average (the average of the given year and
> the four preceding years) is also shown, as

> visual indicators of flow changes that might indicate changes in the

> chosen for this exam- ple largely because its watershed is relatively

> **nonstationarity** in the time series are illustrated in Figure 3--3.
> The statistical descriptors of the data (e.g., mean, variance) change
> in Figure 3--3(a) due to a linear trend---for example, due to
> urbaniza- tion or other development that increases runoff. Long-term
> cyclic trends are shown in Figure 3--3(b), perhaps due to
> climatological changes. The variance of the flows is reduced around
> 1970 in Figure 3--3(c), perhaps due to construc- tion of a dam
> upstream of the gage. Finally, the average flow decreases around 1970
> in Figure 3--3(d), perhaps due to upstream diversions. Formal methods
> for evaluating such changes or trends in time series are discussed by
> Priestly (1981), Helsel and Hirsch (1992), Salas (1993), and Chatfield
> (2003).

> presence of two or more causative mechanisms for the time series data.

> To aid in the selection of a fitted frequency distribution, quantized-
> continuous data are often presented in the form of a *bar chart,* or
> **histogram**. The height and general shape of the histogram are
> useful for characterizing the data and lend insight into the selection
> of a frequency distribution to be applied---for example, whether or
> not the distribution should be symmetric or skewed. Using streamflows
> as an example, the range of flows is first divided into **class
> intervals**, and the number of observations (**frequency**)
> corresponding to each class interval is tabulated. The width of the
> class inter- vals should be small enough so that the underlying
> pattern of the data may be seen but large enough so that such a
> pattern does not become confusing. The value used for the class
> interval can alter the viewer's impression of the data (Benjamin and
> Cornell, 1970); this value may conveniently be altered in many
> computer plotting programs so that the engineer can compare many
> different options. As an aid, Panofsky and Brier (1968) suggest
>
> *k* = 5 log~10~ *n*, (3--1)
>
> where *k* is the number of class intervals and *n* is the number of
> data values. Class intervals do not have to be of constant width if it
> is more convenient to group some data into a larger, aggregated
> interval.
>
> If the ordinates of the histogram are divided by the total number of
> observations, **relative frequencies** (probabilities) of each class
> interval result, such that the ordinates sum to 1.0, providing an
> alternative method of plot- ting the data. Still a third way is in the
> form of a **cumulative frequency dis- tribution**, which represents a
> summation of the histogram relative frequencies up to a given interval
> and is the probability that a value along the abscissa is less than or
> equal to the magnitude at that point. Both relative frequencies and
> cumulative frequencies are extensively used in hydrology and are best
> illustrated by an example.

> **PROBABILITY CONCEPTS**
>
> Consider an experiment with *N* possible outcomes, *X*~1~, *X*~2~, . .
> . , *X~i~*, . . . , *X~N~*. The outcomes are **mutually exclusive** if
> no two of them can occur simultane- ously. They are **collectively
> exhaustive** if they account for all possible out- comes of the
> experiment. The **probability** of an event *X~i~* may be defined as
>
> the relative number of occurrences of the event after a very large
> number of trials. This probability may be estimated as *P*(*X~i~*) =
> *n~i~ n*, where *n~i~* is the number of occurrences (frequency) of
> event *X~i~* in *n* trials. Thus, *n~i~ n* is the relative frequency
> or probability of occurrence of *X~i~*. (See Fig. 3--4.)
>
> A **discrete probability** is simply the probability of a discrete
> event. If one defines *P*(*X~i~*) as the probability of the random
> event *X~i~*, the following conditions hold on the discrete
> probabilities of these events when considered over the sample space of
> *N* possible outcomes:
>
> 0 ≤ *P*(*X~i~*) ≤ 1, (3--2)

*N*

> a *P*(*X~i~*) = 1. (3--3)
>
> *i* = 1
>
> The probability of the **union** (occurrence of either, symbolized by
> U) of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of
> each:

*P*(*X*~1~ U *X*~2~) = *P*(*X*~1~) + *P*(*X*~2~). (3--4)

> Two events *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~ are **independent** if the occurrence of
> one does not influence the occurrence of the other. The probability of
> the **intersection** (occurrence of both, symbolized by ∩) of two
> independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ U *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~). (3--5)
>
> For events that are neither independent nor mutually exclusive,

*P*(*X*~1~ U *X*~2~) = *P*(*X*~1~) + *P*(*Y*~1~) - *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~).
(3--6)

> The conditional probability of event *X*~1~ given that event *Y*~1~
> has occurred is
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ \| *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~)\>*P*(*Y*~1~). (3--7)
>
> If events *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~ are independent, then Equations (3--5) and

*P*(*X*~1~ \| *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~)\>*P*(*Y*~1~) =
*P*(*X*~1~). (3--8)

>
> **CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES**
>
> Let event *Y*~1~ be the condition that a rainstorm occurs on a given
> day and event *X*~1~ be the condition that lightning is observed on a
> given day.
>
> Let probabilities of these events be

>
> *P*(*Y*~1~) = 0.1 (Probability of rain = 10%)

> *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~) = *P*(*Y*~1~ \| *X*~1~) . *P*(*X*~1~) = 0.15.

> **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**
>
> The behavior of a random variable may be described by its probability
> dis- tribution. Every possible outcome of an experiment is assigned a
> numerical value according to a discrete **probability mass function**
> (PMF) or a continuous **probability density function (PDF)**. In
> hydrology, discrete random variables are most commonly used to
> describe the *number* of occurrences that satisfy a certain criterion,
> such as the number of floods that exceed a specified value or the
> number of storms that occur at a given location. Examples later in
> this chapter will be of this type. As a rule, discrete random
> variables are associ- ated with parameters that can assume only
> integer values. However, it is possible to round continuous variables
> to the nearest integer or to rescale to integers. For example, 2.18
> in. of rain is 218 hundredths of an inch of rain.
>
> Occasionally, it is convenient to treat a continuous variable in a
> dis- crete sense, as for the flows described in Figure 3--4. Let the
> notation *P*(*x*~1~)
>
> mean the probability that the random variable *X* takes on the value
> *x*~1~ { Δ*x*.
>
> From Figure 3--4, Δ*x* = 2500 cfs, or half of the class interval. Thus
> letting *X*
>
> represent "discrete" streamflows, we can assign relative frequencies
> from Figure 3--4:

*P*(7500) = 0.013, *P*(27,500) = 0.093,

*P*(12,500) = 0.173, *P*(32,500) = 0.080,

> *P*(17,500) = 0.360, *P*(37,500) = 0.000,
>
> *P*(22,500) = 0.267, *P*(42,500) = 0.013.
>
> Note that these values satisfy the probability axioms of Equations
> (3--2) and (3--3). Furthermore, for discrete probabilities,
>
> *P*(*a* ≤ *x* ≤ *b*) = a *P*(*x~i~*). (3--9)
>
> *a* ≤ *x~i~* ≤ *b*
>
> The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) is defined as

> *F*(*x*) = *P*(*X* ≤ *x*) = a *P*(*x~i~*). (3--10)

> The most common means used in hydrology to indicate the probability of
> an event is to assign a **return period**, or **recurrence interval**,
> to the event. The return period is defined as follows:
>
> An annual maximum event has a return period (or recurrence interval)
> of *T* years if its magnitude is equaled or exceeded once, *on the
> average*, every *T* years. The reciprocal of *T* is the exceed- ance
> probability, 1 - *F*, of the event---that is, the probability that the
> event is equaled or exceeded in any one year.
>
> Thus, the 50-yr flood has a probability of 0.02, or 2%, of being
> equaled or exceeded in any single year. It is imperative to realize
> that the return period implies nothing about the actual time sequence
> of an event. The 50-yr flood does not occur like clockwork once every
> 50 yr. Rather, one expects that on the average, about twenty 50-yr
> floods will be experienced during a 1000-yr period. There could in
> fact be two 50-yr floods in a row (with probability

2.  \* 0.02 = 0.0004 for independent events). For this reason, labeling
    a 50-yr flood as a "2% flood" is often a clearer indication to the
    public as to its true likelihood of occurrence in any one year.

> The concept of a return period implies independent events and is usu-
> ally found by analyzing the series of maximum annual floods (or

>
> A further option is to use all the data in the historic time series,
> whether or not they are independent. This is called the **complete
> series**; an example is the series of 365 daily average streamflows.
> Note that the maximum daily average streamflow is not necessarily the
> maximum flow for the day, since the U.S. Geological Survey records
> hourly or 15-min values and determines the maximum flow as the highest
> recorded value and the daily average as the average of the 24 or 96
> recorded values. Frequency information derived from such a complete
> series is usually shown in a **flow-duration curve** (Searcy, 1959),
> which is a plot of magnitude vs. percentage of time the mag- nitude is
> equaled or exceeded (Fig. 3--12). The information from such an
> analysis cannot be directly related to return period, since the values
> in the complete series are not necessarily independent; for example,
> day-to-day average streamflow values are highly correlated.

> discrete distribution considered in this text; it is very commonly
> used in hydrology.

> **EXAMPLE 3--7**
>
> **CRITICAL FLOOD DESIGN**
>
> Consider the 50-yr flood 1*p* = 0.022.

a.  What is the probability that at least one 50-yr flood will occur
    during the 30-yr lifetime of a flood control project? This is just
    the risk of failure discussed above, and the distribution of the
    number of failures is *B*(30, 0.02). Thus, from Equation (3--51),

> Risk = 1 - (1.0 - 0.02)^30^
>
> = 1 - 0.98^30^
>
> = 1 - 0.545
>
> = 0.455.
>
> If this risk is too great, the engineer might design for the 100-yr
> event for which the risk is
>
> Risk = 1 - 0.99^30^ = 0.26
>
> and the reliability is 0.74. For this latter circumstance, there is a
> 26% chance of occurrence of the 100-yr event over the 30-yr life- time
> of the project.
>
> When it is not possible to reduce the risk to a desired level by
> designing for a high (but hypothetical) return period event, an
> alternative is to design for the **probable maximum flood**, which is
> the flood that results from the **probable maximum precipitation
> (PMP)** event. The PMP is the highest precipitation likely to occur
> under known meteorological conditions (Smith, 1993; Mays, 2001)
>
> and has been computed for most areas of the United States by the
> National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center
> ([http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/studies/pmp.html).](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/studies/pmp.html))

b.  What is the probability that the 100-yr flood will not occur in 10
    yr? In 100 yr?

For *n* = 10, *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - *P*)^10^ = 0.99^10^ = 0.904,

For *n* = 100, *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - *p*)^100^ = 0.99^100^ = 0.37.

> Thus, there is a 37% chance (37% reliability) that the 100-yr flood
> will not occur during a sequence of 100 yr.

c.  In general, what is the probability of having no floods greater than
    the *T*-yr flood during a sequence of *T* yr?

> *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - 1\>*T*)*^T^*.

As *T* gets large, this approaches 1\>*e* (Benjamin and Cornell, 1970,

> p\. 234). Thus for large *T*,
>
> *P*(*x* = 0) ≈ *e*^-1^ = 0.368 (the reliability)

and

> *P*(*x* ≥ 0) ≈ 1 - *e*^-1^ = 0.632 (the risk).
>
> As an approximation, the *T*-yr flood will occur within a *T*-yr
> period with approximately a 2 3 probability.
>
> **The Exponential Distribution**
>
> Consider a process of random arrivals such that the arrivals (events)

    storms?

> Prob(*t* ≥ 96) = 1 - *F*(96) = *e*^-0.0135^.96 = 0.27.

b.  What is the probability that the separation between two storms will

Prob(*t* = 12) = 0,

c.  What is the probability that the separation between two storms will
    be less than or equal to 12 hr?

Prob(*t* ≤ 12) = *F*(12) = 1 - *e*^-0.0135^.12 = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

> theorem states that under very general conditions, as the number of

> large number of random variables will approach the normal
> distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution (Benjamin and
> Cornell, 1970). Many physical processes can be conceptualized as the

> **The Lognormal Distribution**
>
> Consider a hypothetical runoff calculation, in which runoff is equal
> to the *product* of functions of several random factors, such as
> rainfall, contributing area, loss coefficient, and evaporation. In
> general, if a random variable *x* results from the product of a large
> number of other random variables (i.e., a "multiplicative mechanism"),
> then the distribution of the logarithm of *x* will approach normality,
> since the logarithm of *x* will consist of the sum of the logs of the
> contributing factors. In hydrology, it is easy to conceive of many
> contributing factors to runoff that are inherently random and about
> which there is very little deterministic information. Hence, a
> multiplicative mechanism for runoff may be a very reasonable
> assumption. In general, a random variable has a **lognormal**
> distribution if the log of the random vari- able is distributed
> normally. For example, if *y* = log *x* and if *y* is distributed
> normally, then *x* is distributed lognormally.
>
> The lognormal PDF is sketched in Figure 3--15. Because it is bounded
> on the left by zero, has a positive skewness, and is easily used
> through its relationship to the normal, it is widely applied in
> hydrology. The skewness is a function of the coefficient of variation:
>
> *g* = 3*CV* + *CV*^3^. (3--60)
>
> The skewness of the transformed variable *y* is, of course, zero,
> since *y* is distributed normally.
>
> Although the PDF of *x* (the untransformed variable) can easily be
> derived (Benjamin and Cornell, 1970), it is seldom needed. Instead,
> the moments of *y* = log *x* (either base 10 or natural logs may be
> used) are found, and the normal distribution is used for *y*. This may
> be done in two ways. The method of moments requires that the moments
> of the untransformed data be calculated and related to the moments of
> the logs. When the natural log is used (i.e., *y* = ln *x*), these

> **APPLICATION OF LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION TO FLOOD FLOWS**
>
> Repeat Example 3--10 using the lognormal distribution. Parameters of
> the logs (base 10) were calculated in Example 3--3.

(a) What is the 100-yr flood?

> The *z* value was found in Example 3--10 to be 2.326. Thus,
>
> *y*~100~ = 4.29209 + 2.326 . 0.12905 = 4.5923
>
> **EXAMPLE 3--11**

and

> *Q*~100~ = 10*^y^*100 = 39,100 cfs.
>
> This value is much higher than the estimate (34,620 cfs) from the
> normal distribution. But it is a better estimate because the lognor-
> mal distribution more accurately reflects the skewness of the actual
> flow data. (Note that it is a good practice to carry several
> significant figures when working with logarithms, and round only for
> the final answer.)

(b) What is the probability that a flow will be less than or equal to
    30,000 cfs?

> The value of *y* = log~10~ 30,000 = 4.4771.
>
> *z* [4.4771 - 4.2921]{.underline} 1.4337.
>
> 0.12905
>
> Interpolating linearly in Table D--1, *F* 11.43372 = 0.9242. The
> return period of a 30,000-cfs flood is thus 1\> 11 - 0.92422 = 13.1
> yr.

(c) How do the moment estimates from the log-transformed data com- pare
    > with those found using Equations (3--61) and (3--62)? These two
    > equations must be solved for the moments of the logs. With data

> **The Gamma (Pearson Type 3) Distribution**
>
> This distribution receives extensive use in hydrology simply because
> of its shape and its well-known mathematical properties. The
> three-parameter gamma distribution is sketched in Figure 3--15 and has
> the pleasing proper- ties of being bounded on the left (the lower
> limit is 5015 cfs) and of positive skewness. (The distribution can
> also be used with negative skewness.) Although the three parameters of
> the PDF are simple functions of the mean, variance, and skewness
> (Kite, 1977; Bobée and Ashkar, 1991), it is more common in hydrologic
> applications to evaluate the CDF with frequency fac- tors (Section

> that spreadsheet functions such as Excel's GAMMADIST and GAMMAINV make
> it possible to avoid the tedious process of using any tabular values;

>
> *Q~T~* = *Q* + *K*(*C~s~*, *T*) . *S~Q~*. (3--67)

The frequency factor *K* \[Eq. (3--43)\] serves as the required function

*h*(*F*) as long as it is not also a function of skewness. For example,

1.  Estimate the mean of the logs and the standard deviation of the logs
    using the procedure just described for the normal distribution. That
    is, the logarithm of the value plotted at 50% is the mean of the
    logs:

> *y* = ln *x~m~* = ln *x*~50~ (3--71)

> *S~y~* = ln *x*~84.1~ - ln *x*~50~ = ln(*x*~84.1~\>*x*~50~), (3--72)
>
> *y* = ln *x*.

2.  Knowing these moments of *y*, the moments of the untransformed
    variable *x* must be calculated from the relationships given in
    Equa- tions (3--61) and (3--62).

> but these tests are seldom helpful in discriminating among different

> tend to lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that the distribution
> fits the data. See, for example, the very wide 90% confidence
> intervals plotted in Figure 3--18 using the *KS* statistic. An
> alternative is to use heuristic measures of goodness of fit, such as
> the average of absolute values of deviations between the fitted and
> plotted CDF (Benson, 1968). Another possibility is to include the
> third and fourth moments of the data in the analysis, since these may
> be used to categorize different distribu- tions (Harr, 1977). But the
> problems of estimation of higher moments have already been discussed.
> Better alternatives (in the sense of greater discrimina- tion among
> alternative distributions) are the probability plot correlation coef-
> ficient method and L-moment tests, summarized by Stedinger et al.
> (1993). In the end, the decision is often subjective and based on a
> preference for the underlying mechanism of one distribution vs.
> another. That is, the engineer may prefer the multiplicative mechanism
> of the lognormal distribution or the empiricism of the gamma or log
> Pearson type 3 distributions.
>
> Graphical comparison of the fitted and plotted CDFs is of considerable
> use in the decision. King (1971) has shown the form that several CDFs
> exhibit when plotted on the probability paper of another distribution,
> and Reich and Renard (1981) apply these shapes to hydrology. For
> example, if the data are plotted on lognormal paper and a Gumbel
> distribution fits the data, the data should appear with curvature.
> Unfortunately, the gamma and log Pearson 3 distributions cannot be
> assessed in this manner, since they have no probability paper.
>
> Instead of trying several distributions and attempting to select the
> best fit, one could simply accept the recommendations of the U.S.
> IACWD (1982) (formerly the U.S. Water Resources Council; Benson,
>
> 1968\) that the LP3 distribution is best suited for flood frequency
> analysis. On the other hand, the log-Gumbel (extreme-value type II)
> was deter- mined by the Natural Environment Research Council (1975) to
> be pref- erable for flood frequency analysis in Great Britain.
> Individual rivers are likely to vary in their optimal distribution,
> and the question of which distribution to use for floods and myriad
> other hydrologic variables will always remain open.
>
> **GRAPHICAL COMPARISON OF FOUR DISTRIBUTIONS**
>
> Which distribution is best for the data for the Siletz River? One very
> qualitative assessment can be made from the four PDFs shown in Fig-
> ure 3--15. From the figure, we see little difference among them. How-
> ever, common practice is to compare the CDFs on probability paper; and
> for this purpose, all the distributions may be plotted together on
> lognormal paper for another qualitative assessment. Several predicted
> magnitudes are needed, since all but the lognormal will plot as smooth
> curves. These calculations are shown in Table 3--8 (including more
> than just the required two points for the lognormal). The resulting
> plots are shown in Figure 3--19 along with selected data points (only
> every fifth data point is plotted in the middle of the distribution,
> in order to have a better view of the four fitted distributions).

> ![](./images/media/image209.png)It is important to realize that, were
> confidence limits shown (as on Fig. 3--18), they would be very wide at
> the upper limit of the CDF, reflect- ing the uncertainty of predicting
> the magnitude of, say, the 100-yr flood from only 75 yr of data. The
> uncertainty can be quantified by computing the standard deviation of
> the estimates at the extremes, using a different procedure for each
> distribution (Kite, 1977; Stedinger et al., 1993). One way to reduce
> the uncertainty is to use a longer period of record (not pos- sible)
> or a regional analysis, in which regional streamflow data are
>
> aggregated and used in a regression-type analysis (Section 3.7). The
> National Research Council (1988) study describes several options for
> improvements of frequency estimates, including regional analysis,
> better structure in models, and focusing on the upper extremes (for
> floods).

> Finally, plots such as Figure 3--19 can be used to interpolate for
> flood frequencies for the gamma and LP3 distributions, as suggested in
> Examples 3--12 and 3--13, in lieu of the use of tables or spreadsheet
> functions. Given the uncertainty inherent in flood frequency
> estimates, two-significant- figure accuracy from a plot is generally
> accurate enough. For instance, the nonexceedance probability of a flow
> of 30,000 cfs is approximately 93% by any of the four distributions,
> with a corresponding return period of about 14 years.

>
> All the computations, tables, and figures in this chapter were
> prepared eas- ily in Excel. Functions for obtaining the cumulative
> normal distribution and its inverse and the cumulative gamma
> distribution and its inverse are par- ticularly helpful. On the other
> hand, preparation of probability paper plots of the type of Figures
> 3--18 and 3--19 takes more effort, since the vertical lines of the
> probability scale must be inserted ("drawn") and labeled by the user.
> Nonetheless, the task is straightforward.
>
> Flood frequency software is available from various sources. The Hydro-
> logical Frequency Analysis (HFA) program may be purchased as an
> adjunct to the text by Bobée and Ashkar (1991) for analysis and
> probability plots of various formulations of the gamma and LP3
> distributions. The Bulletin 17B procedure of the IACWD (1982) has been
> programmed by the Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering
> Center (HEC), and is available as the program HEC-SSP (HEC Statistical
> Software Package). See the HEC web- site
> (<http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/)> for information about how to obtain
> the software. A similar program for Bulletin 17B analysis, PEAKFQ, has
> been prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey and may be downloaded from
> its website,
> [http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/surface_water.](http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/surface_water)
> At the same location, the program SWSTAT may be downloaded, which
> performs many different kinds of statistical and related analyses on
> time-series data, includ- ing preparation of flow-duration curves,
> trend analysis, and a simplified form of the Bulletin 17B analysis.

> Flood frequency estimates illustrated in this chapter rely upon a
> record of flows measured at one station. The shorter the record, the

> **REGIONAL ANALYSIS**
>
> Hosking and Wallis (1997). One alternative is to perform regional
> esti- mates of key statistics, such as skewness, illustrated with the
> discussion of Figure 3--10. Another alternative is a regional
> regression: *T*-year floods are computed for as many streams as
> possible using the LP3 distribution, sometimes with the aid of
> simulation models, and their magnitudes regressed against catchment
> characteristics. The relationship often takes the form of a multiple
> regression analysis (power-function form), in which catchment area is
> usually the most important independent variable. In this way,
> uncertainty in a short-record-length estimate at one station is bal-
> anced against a longer-record estimate at other stations. Such
> relationships are also good ways in which to estimate flood peaks at
> ungaged locations. The U.S. Geological Survey has prepared these
> relationships for many locations in the United States. Examples
> include Harris et al. (1979) and Cooper (2005) for western Oregon,
> Sauer et al. (1983) for urban areas in the United States, Laenen
> (1983) for urban areas in western Oregon, and Franklin and Losey
> (1984) for Tallahassee, Florida. An automated pro- gram, NFF (for
> National Flood Frequency), which incorporates all pub- lished results
> for the United States, has been published by the USGS (Ries and
> Crouse, 2002). Local offices of the USGS should be contacted for
> access to studies for specific regions.
>
> The nationwide urban equations of Sauer et al. (1983) depend on local
> estimates of rural peaks and cannot be demonstrated here. However, as
> an example, the USGS (Franklin and Losey, 1984) has performed a flood
> fre- quency analysis on 15 basins in the Tallahassee, Florida, area
> using a com- bination of continuous simulation and regression. The
> resulting regression equation for most of the Tallahassee area is
>
> *Q~p~*(*T*) = *C~p~A^a^IA^b^*, (3--82)
>
> where
>
> *Q~p~* = predicted flood peak for return period *T* (cfs),
>
> *A* = drainage area (mi^2^),
>
> *IA* = impervious area as percentage of total area *A*,
>
> and *C~p~*, *a*, and *b* are coefficients that are functions of return
> period, as given in Table 3--9. The 15 basins ranged from 0.2 to 16
> mi^2^ and imperviousness ranged from 5.8% to 54%. Coefficients of
> determination (*R*^2^) for the multiple regression ranged from 0.97 to
> 0.99 for the indicated equations, but standard errors of estimate were
> 18% to 30%. That is, there is a 68% chance (one standard deviation on
> either side of the mean, for the normal distribution) that the unknown
> "true" flood estimate will fall within 18% to 30% of the true mean.
> The regression predictions are mainly for use in ungaged catch- ments.
> For example, for the 3.44 mi^2^ McGinnis Arm Catchment in Tallahas-
> see, the imperviousness percentage is 28.3, for which Equation (3--82)
> yields a 10-yr peak flow of 1850 cfs.

> **SUMMARY**
>
> This chapter contains only a sampling of possible topics in frequency
> analysis. Other topics of particular importance are improved
> estimation procedures by the method of maximum likelihood and
> L-moments (see Section 3.3), and confidence limits and uncertainty
> (see Section 3.6). The reader may refer to the cited references for
> ad- ditional information.
>
> In this chapter, introductory definitions related to description of
> data and probability theory are followed by methods for fitting
> theoretical frequency distri- butions to measured data. One discrete
> and five continuous distributions are de- scribed and applied. The
> emphasis is on flood frequency analysis, but the procedures can be
> applied to any set of independent hydrologic data, such as rainfall,
> stage, annual flow volumes, temperatures, and water quality
> parameters. Apart from the recommended use of the log-Pearson 3
> distribution for flood frequency analysis in
>
> the United States (IACWD, 1982), there is no consensus regarding
> distributions most suited to any particular variable; however, for
> storm runoff quality, studies have shown that storm runoff event mean
> concentrations (i.e., flow-weighted av- erage storm event
> concentrations) are almost universally distributed lognormally
> (Driscoll, 1986).
>
> Although most of the distributions discussed can also be applied to
> minima (e.g., droughts), the parameter estimates may vary from those
> given for the maxima to accommodate the possible negative skewness of
> the droughts. For use of any dis- tribution other than the normal for
> minima, reference should be made to Gumbel (1958), Benjamin and
> Cornell (1970), Stedinger et al. (1993), or Haan (2002) for parameter
> estimation.

1.  This chapter employs Siletz River data for the continuous period
    1925--1999. As of this writing, peak flow data through water year
    2010 are available on the USGS Oregon surface water data webpage
    [http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/sw,](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/sw)
    including for Gage Number 14305500, which is the Siletz River. You
    will be asked in different problems in this chapter to update the
    Chapter 3 examples by using the 86-yr record, 1925--2010.

    a.  Download the peak flow data for the Siletz River, and enter the
        data into a spreadsheet.

    b.  Plot the 86 years of peak flows (1925--2010) and a 5-yr running
        mean vs. their water year, to update Figure 3--2. Comment in
        general about the appearance of this time series, in the manner
        of the discussion of Figure 3--2.

    c.  Using the updated data, develop new relative frequency and
        cumulative frequency histograms; that is, update Figures 3--4
        and 3--5.

2.  \(a\) Use the data found in Problem 3.1 to calculate the mean,
    standard devia- tion, and skew coefficient (Eqs. 3--37, 3--38, and
    3--40) of the updated Siletz River data (1925--2010).

(b) Repeat part (a) using the logs (base 10) of the Siletz River data.

(c) Develop the weighted skewness of the logs according to the Bulletin
    17B protocol. That is, redo Example 3--3. At the conclusion of this
    problem, you should have an updated version of Table 3--2.

    1.  A temporary cofferdam is being designed to protect a 5-yr
        construction project from the 30-yr flood. What is the
        probability that the cofferdam will be overtopped:

        a.  at least once during the 5-yr project,

        b.  not at all during the project,

        c.  in the first year only,

        d.  in the fourth year and fifth year exactly?

    a.  The probability that the park will flood next year

    b.  The probability that the park will flood at least once in the
        > next 20 yr

    c.  The probability that the park will flood three times in the next
        > 20 yr

    d.  The probability that the park will flood 10 times in the next 20
        > yr

5.  This problem asks you to perform a descriptive analysis using real
    > data of inter- est to you. The problem should be done using
    > spreadsheet or similar software.

    a.  Download a series of annual maximum flows for a river of
        > interest to you. USGS data may be obtained starting at the
        > website <http://water.usgs.gov/> nwis/. Import the data into
        > your spreadsheet or similar software. Convert the lines of
        > text data into columnar data.

    b.  Note the characteristics of the basin from its description in
        > the USGS files. What are the basin area and latitude and
        > longitude of the gage? Are there diversions, controls, or
        > storage (e.g., reservoirs) upstream?

    c.  Plot the time series of peak flows and log~10~ (flows) vs. water
        year. The series of log~10~ (flows) should have a lower
        coefficient of variation. Does the shape of the time-series plot
        of flows suggest that the time-series of river peak flows is
        nonstationary? If so, discuss possible reasons.

    d.  Compute and plot relative-frequency histograms for the flows and
        log (flows). Discuss any difference in skewness evident from the
        two plots.

    e.  Compute the following statistics for the series of flows and for
        the series of log~10~ (flows): number, average, unbiased
        variance, unbiased standard deviation, coefficient of variation,
        unbiased skewness, maximum, and minimum.

6.  For the data of Problem 3.25, compute a weighted skew coefficient
    according to the Bulletin 17B method.

7.  For the data of Problem 3.25, fit a log Pearson 3 distribution to
    the peak flows, using the method of moments described in this text.
    Use the weighted skew coefficient computed in Problem 3.26.

    a.  Compute estimated flows for return periods listed in Table 3--4.

    b.  Plot the fitted CDF on lognormal probability paper.

    c.  Using the Cunnane plotting-position formula (with parameter *a*
        = 0.4), plot enough of the measured flows to provide a
        comparison similar to Figure 3--19. Discuss the fit.

8.  Repeat Problem 3.27 using the lognormal and three-parameter gamma
    distributions.

9.  For a station of interest to you, download 10 yr of daily average
    streamflow data from the USGS website
    [http://water.usgs.gov/nwis/.](http://water.usgs.gov/nwis/) Paste
    the data into a spreadsheet and convert the text data to columns.
    Construct and plot a flow- duration curve for these data. From the
    table and chart, what are the flows equaled or exceeded 20%, 50%,
    and 90% of the time?

10. Interevent times for winter storms arriving at Corvallis, Oregon,
    for the months November through April for the winters of 1996--97,
    1997--98, and 1998--99 were determined, and a frequency histogram
    prepared as shown in the table below. The average interevent time
    was 2.59 days.

    a.  Fit an exponential distribution to these data by finding the
        parameter l.

    b.  Plot the relative-frequency histogram and the fitted exponential
        PDF on the same chart. Care may need to be taken to be sure that
        the histogram and PDF are properly aligned. Each day (0--1,
        1--2, and so on) is a class interval.

    c.  From the relative-frequency histogram, compute the
        cumulative-frequency histogram and plot on arithmetic graph
        paper.

    d.  On two-cycle semilog paper (or using spreadsheet options for
        log-scales), plot the empirical CDF from part (c) and the fitted
        CDF. On this "prob- ability paper," values should be plotted at
        the class mark, centering on

> half-days. The empirical values from part (c) should be plotted as
> individual points, and one fitted CDF (exceedance probability) should
> be plotted as a straight line.

e.  What is the probability that the time between winter storms is ≤ 3
    > days? Compute using both the empirical CDF and the fitted CDF.

12. Using statistics for Siletz River peak flows, 1979--1999 (Table
    > 3--1), generate a se- ries of normally distributed synthetic
    > streamflows by following these guidelines.

    a.  By performing a regression of flows for the period 1980--1999
        > vs. flows during 1979--1998, verify that the serial
        > correlation coefficient for this time period is 0.1411.

    b.  Verify that the mean and unbiased standard deviation for the
        > full 21-year period are 19,343 cfs and 7217 cfs, respectively.
        > Use these values for part (c).

    c.  The list of 21 *N*(0, 1) random numbers below was generated in
        Excel using the Tools/Data Analysis/Random Number Generation
        option with a seed of 12345. (The option for a seed allows one
        to generate identical sequences of random numbers.) Assuming
        that the initial flow = mean (at "step 0"), generate a sequence
        of 21 random flows using Equation (3--83). Com- pute the mean,
        standard deviation, and serial correlation coefficient of the
        synthetic flow sequence to see how well these statistics are
        preserved. *Optional:* Create a new series of *N*(0, 1) random
        numbers and repeat the generation. Notice that as the mean and
        standard deviation of the random numbers differ from 0 and 1,
        respectively, so do the mean and standard deviation of the
        synthetic sequence differ from their historic values.

> The movement of a flood wave down a channel or through a reservoir and

> The **storage routing** concept is most easily understood by referring

> time *t*~1~, inflow and outflow are equal and the maximum storage is
> reached. For times exceeding *t*~1~, outflow exceeds inflow and the
> reservoir empties. Area *C* represents the volume of water that flows
> out of the reservoir and must equal area *A* if the reservoir begins
> and ends at the same level. The peak of the outflow from a reservoir
> should intersect the inflow hydrograph as shown in Figure 4--1, since,

a.  Determine the average storage for each one-day period (Δ*t* = 1
    day). Graph storage vs. time for the reservoir for the event. Assume
    that *S*~0~ = 0 (the reservoir is initially empty).

b.  What is the (approximate) maximum storage reached during this storm
    event?

> River routing differs from reservoir routing in that storage in a
> river reach of length *L* depends on more than just outflow. The peak
> of the out- flow hydrograph from a reach is usually attenuated and
> delayed compared with that of the inflow hydrograph. Because storage
> in a river reach is a function of whether stages are rising or
> falling, storage in this case is a func- tion of both outflow and
> inflow for the routing reach (see Section 4.3). Also, as river stages
> rise high enough to inundate a floodplain beyond the banks of the
> channel, significant velocity reductions are observed in the
> floodplain compared with the main channel. Example 4--2 presents
> differences between river and reservoir routing.

> Hydraulic routing is more complex and accurate than hydrologic

> The Muskingum method assumes that flow and storage are both related to

> *x* = weighting factor, which varies from 0 to 0.5 for a given reach.
>
> For the case of linear reservoir routing where *S* depends only on
> outflow, *x* = 0 in Equation (4--4). In smooth uniform channels, *x* =
> 0.5 yields equal weight to inflow and outflow, which theoretically
> results in pure translation of the wave. A typical range for most

> To determine Muskingum coefficients, we guess a value of *x* and then
> plot \[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\] vs. *S*. The one plot that comes closest
> to being a straight line is chosen to determine the coefficient
> values. The average value is *x* = 0.2 for a natural stream.
> Therefore, we assume that *x* must lie between
>
> 0.1 and 0.3. Plots of \[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\] vs. *S* are made for *x*
> = 0.1, *x* = 0.2, and *x* = 0.3 using the values listed in Table E4--4
> (see Fig. E4--4).

The lower outflow is an 18-in. reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) that will
be assumed to behave as an orifice with an entrance loss coefficient,
*C~d~*, of 0.9:

*Q*orifice = *CdAo* 22*gh*,

> where
>
> *Q*~orifice~ = orifice outflow (cfs or cms),
>
> *C~d~* = orifice entrance loss coefficient,
>
> *A~o~* = orifice area = p*D*^2^ 4 for a circular pipe of diameter *D*,
> *g* = gravitational acceleration (32.2 ft/s^2^ or 9.8 m/s^2^), and
>
> *h* = depth above the orifice centerline (ft or m).
>
> The ogee spillway is assumed to behave like a weir (Davis, 1952;
> French, 1985) with equation
>
> *Q*~weir~ = *C~e~* 12\>32 22*g L*1*h* - *h*~0~21.5,
>
> where
>
> *Q*~weir~ = spillway discharge (cfs or cms),
>
> *C~e~* = weir discharge coefficient,
>
> *L* = weir length (perpendicular to discharge) (ft or m), and
>
> *h*~0~ = elevation of weir crest (ft or m).
>
> For this example, *D* = 1.5 ft, *C~d~* = 0.9, *C~e~* ≈ 0.7 (Davis,
> 1952), *L* = 15 ft, and *h*~0~ = 5 ft. The orifice and weir outflows
> are assumed to obey the indicated equations even for low heads. The
> stage--discharge analysis
>
> could be refined in the event that this assumption must be modified.
> The sum of the orifice and weir outflows constitutes a **rating
> curve** for the small reservoir. The rating curve could be tabular or
> derived from exper- iments in lieu of equations such as those for the
> orifice and weir.
>
> Using the depth, storage, and outflow relationships developed in the
> table, route the hydrograph through the reservoir. What is the maximum
> height reached in the reservoir for this inflow? Use Δ*t* = 10 min.

> **SOLUTION**
>
> There are two steps to the solution: In step 1, we develop a storage-
> indication curve from the indicated geometry and outflow
> relationships. This will involve additional computations to determine
> storage vs. depth. Step 2 is the routing procedure using the
> continuity equation and the storage-indication curve.
>
> The geometry of the trapezoids results in the surface areas shown in
> the table. Storage (volume) *S* is the integral of surface area *A*:
>
> *S* = 1*A dh*.
>
> The integration is performed numerically in the table, using the
> **trapezoi- dal rule**. In this case, incremental volumes are computed
> by assuming the function *A h* can be approximated as a series of
> trapezoids with sides *A~i~* and *A~i~*~+1~ and width Δ*h*. Then the
> incremental volume is
>
> Δ*S [Ai ]{.underline}*[+ *Ai* + 1]{.underline} Δ*h*.
>
> 2
>
> Thus, the incremental volume between depth 2 ft and 3 ft is

Δ*S* =

> 9233 ft^2^ + 11,064 ft^2^
>
> 2
>
> . 1 ft = 10,148 ft^3^.
>
> Cumulative volume is simply the sum of the incremental volumes. Note
> that the elevation increment Δ*h* need not remain constant and can be
> reduced if greater definition of outflows is needed---above the weir
> crest, for instance. Also, note that the depth *h* is an intermedi-
> ate variable in the computations and is not used in the remainder of
> the procedure. Finally, observe the importance of accurate contours,
> normally derived from a survey, in developing the stage-vs.-volume
> relationship.
>
> Next, we develop a storage-indication curve for the pond. This is a
> plot of 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* vs. *Q* (where *Q* is total outflow). For
> instance, at *Q* = 50 cfs, *S* = 59,173 ft^3^ and

2*S* 2(59,173 ft^3^)

> Δ*t* + *Q* = (10 min)(60 s/min) + 50 cfs = 247 cfs.
>
> These values are tabulated in the preceding table, and the storage-
> indication curve is plotted in Figure E4--5(c). The curve is simply
> another way of presenting the hydraulic relationship between storage
> and outflow. The meaning is that if by another mechanism the quantity
> 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* can be determined, then the outflow *Q* can be
> determined from this relation- ship. Note that the storage-indication
> curve has nothing to do with the inflow hydrograph; the only link is

**KINEMATIC WAVE**

**ROUTING**

> The kinematic wave assumption is that inertial and pressure effects
> are unimportant and that the weight or gravity force of fluid is
> approximately balanced by the resistive forces of bed friction \[Eq.
> (4--30) and Table 4--1\]. Kinematic waves will not accelerate
> appreciably and can flow only in a downstream direction without any
> crest subsidence. Hence, kinematic wave methods cannot account for
> backwater. The flood wave will be observed as a uniform rise and fall
> in water surface over a relatively long period of time. Thus,
> kinematic waves represent the characteristic changes in discharge,
> velocity, and water surface elevation with time at any one location on
> an overland flow plane or along a stream channel. Kinematic waves are
> often classified as uniform, unsteady flows.
>
> The kinematic wave method of routing overland and river flows is
> included in the HEC-HMS program, as described in detail in Chapter 5.
> The following discussion and numerical solutions are based on the HMS
> program because of the wide acceptance and availability (Hydrologic
> Engineering
>
> Center, 2006). Kinematic wave routing is also an important aspect of
> the Storm Water Management Model (Huber and Dickinson, 1988), as
> described in Chapter 6, and the Vflo model described in Chapter 11.
>
> The concept incorporated into HEC-HMS uses various elements such as
> overland flow planes, collector channels, and main channels to route
> kine- matic waves (Fig. 4--9). These various elements are combined to
> describe basin and subbasin responses to storm events. Overland flow
> is handled

> After overland runoff is routed down the length of the overland flow

**HYDRAULIC RIVER**

**ROUTING**

> The application of the Saint Venant equations \[Eqs. (4--23) and
> (4--27)\] in flood routing involves solving them simultaneously down
> the length of a stream channel. An excellent review of methods is
> given by Price (1974), who compares four of the more important
> numerical methods for hydraulic flood routing with exact analytical
> solutions for the monoclinal wave (Sec- tion 4.5). Price found that
> the four-point implicit numerical scheme of Amein and Fang (1970) was
> the most efficient of the methods and is most accurate when Δ*x* Δ*t*
> is approximately equal to the speed of the monoclinal wave, the
> kinematic wave speed. In the numerical schemes, the stage was defined
> at the upstream boundary, and rating curve conditions were specified
> at the downstream boundary.
>
> The objective of the numerical flood routing method is to simulate the
> propagation of a flood downstream in a river, given a stage or
> discharge hydrograph at an upstream section. The preceding methods
> provide the most accurate solution available for predicting floods
> downstream in a large river or for considering effects of channel
> alteration or reservoir storage. Because the computational effort is
> relatively large for any numerical solu- tion, careful consideration
> should be given to selecting one of the available hydraulic methods
> vs. one of the simpler, approximate methods such as kine- matic wave
> or the Muskingum method.
>
> **Characteristic Methods**
>
> The early approaches to numerical flood routing were based on the
> charac- teristic form of the governing equations. This form basically
> replaces the par- tial differential equations with four ordinary
> differential equations, which are then solved numerically along the
> characteristic curves. Henderson (1966) and Overton and Meadows (1976)
> present details of the conversion. However, the characteristic method
> is cumbersome because of required interpolation over
>
> the variable grid mesh in space and time. The method involves
> integration along two sets of characteristic curves, and a network of
> variable points is located in the *xt*-plane by the intersection of
> the forward and backward char- acteristic curves. With the advent of
> the more efficient implicit methods described in the sections that
> follow, the characteristic method offers no addi- tional accuracy with
> relatively complex interpolation problems.
>
> **Explicit Methods**
>
> Explicit methods are primarily the outcome of the pioneering work of
> Stoker (1957) and Issacson et al. (1956). A network of nodes, as shown
> in Figure 4--13, is defined for solving the governing equations in *x*
> and *t*. The variables are known at points *L*, *M*, and *R.* The
> centered difference solution is used to solve Equations (4--23) and
> (4--27) for velocity *v*(*P*) and depth*y*(*P*) at point *P*. The
> initial condition and boundary conditions (upstream and downstream)
> must be known from inflow hydrographs and stage--outflow relations.
> The major disadvantage of the explicit approach is the requirement of
> using small time steps, known as the Courant condition, to avoid
> stability problems \[Δ*t* ... Δ*x c*, where *c* is defined in Eq.
> (4--34)\].
>
> **Implicit Methods**
>
> Implicit methods have received the most interest in recent years
> because they overcome the stability problems of explicit methods and
> allow fewer time steps for flood routing. The four-point implicit
> method of Amein and Fang (1970) has the feature of solving the
> nonlinear simultaneous finite- difference equations using the Newton
> iteration technique. In this method, a set of *N* equations with *N*
> unknowns results from writing the equations in space and time and
> incorporating upstream and downstream boundary con- ditions. The
> details of the iteration process are given in Amein and Fang (1970)
> with relevant boundary conditions. The method was applied to sev- eral
> actual flood predictions in North Carolina and was found to be
> accurate and more efficient than the explicit or characteristic
> methods. Computer

> level simultaneously, and larger Δ*x* and Δ*t* values can be used than
> in the explicit method.

> **Diffusion Model**
>
> The diffusion wave model (also called the noninertia model) is
> intermediate in complexity between the kinematic wave model and the
> full dynamic wave model and assumes that the inertia terms in Equation
> (4--27) are negligible compared with the pressure, friction, and

> 0*t* + *c* 0*x* = *D*~1~ 0*x*2 , (4--63)
>
> where *c* is wave celerity and *D*~1~ is a diffusion coefficient
> (defined in the next section). The effect of the diffusion term,
> compared with the kinematic wave, is to make *y* decrease in the view
> of an observer moving at velocity *c*. Thus, attenuation of the flood
> wave is included in the diffusion model, but not for the kinematic
> wave. Attenuation may be important in long rivers or for rivers with
> large floodplains.
>
> The kinematic model applies to shallow flow on steep slopes or to
> long- duration flood waves. The diffusion model applies to a wider
> range of condi- tions, and the full dynamic model applies to any
> condition.

> The Muskingum method presented in Section 4.2 is based on the
> continuity equation and the storage--discharge relation. Cunge (1969)

> to produce a unique relationship between the two for a particular
> location and cross section. However, unless flow can be approximated

> will be greater during the rising stage of a flood hydrograph than
> during the falling stage, leading to a loop rating curve, as shown in
> Figure 4--14. If the hydrograph has multiple peaks, the curve can be
> very complex, as shown in Figure 4--14(a). A theoretical shape for a
> smooth, single-peak hydrograph is shown in Figure 4--14(b).

> The physical explanation for the hysteresis present in the rating

> **Unsteady or Dynamic Models**
>
> Hydrologic routing techniques are not adequate for modeling unsteady
> flows subject to backwater or tidal effects and channels with very
> mild bottom slopes. Chapter 7 discusses the unsteady state version of
> HEC-RAS which uses UNET as the internal program for computations. The
> St. Venant equa- tions, as described earlier, are typically used to
> solve unsteady flow prob- lems. As a result of the development of
> computer hardware and software technology, simulation software became
> widely available to solve the full St. Venant equations in the 1980s
> and 1990s. In the United States, there are two widely used dynamic
> models using the St. Venant equations, FLDWAV and UNET. The FLDWAV
> model that evolved from its earlier versions DAM- BRK (1984) and
> DWOPER (1978) was developed by D. Fread and has been mainly applied to
> the national river forecast; while the UNET model was developed by
> Barkau and has been incorporated into the USACE Hydro- logic
> Engineering Center's River Analysis Systems (HEC-RAS) in order to
> simulate one-dimensional unsteady flow through a full network of open
> channels (Barkau, 1992; HEC, 2010).
>
> Discrete solution over a grid and iteration are the two major
> processes in the computational process in solving the St. Venant
> Equations. HEC-RAS uses an implicit finite-difference scheme in the
> stage of discretization to determine the new values of water level and
> discharge at a discrete point based on all discrete points and with at
> least two time steps solved simultane- ously. This implicit scheme is
> found more stable than other explicit schemes. Both HEC-RAS and DWOPER
> use the four-point numerical scheme. Solv- ing the implicit equations
> requires an iteration approach, which means that at a given time step,
> successive solutions of water level and discharge are obtained until
> the difference of the latest values and the values from the previous
> iteration is small enough. Thus, it is regarded to have converged on
> the correct value. For instance, HEC-RAS uses 0.02 ft and 20 as the
> default water-level convergence and the maximum number of iterations.
>
> The unsteady flow component in HEC-RAS was developed primarily for
> subcritical flow regime calculations. But with version (4.1) of
> HEC-RAS, the model is able to perform mixed flow regime (subcritical,
> super-critical, hydrau- lic jumps, and draw downs) calculations in the
> unsteady flow computation mod- ule. The hydraulic calculations for
> cross sections, bridges, culverts, and other hydraulic structures that
> were developed for the steady flow component were incorporated into
> the unsteady flow module. Additionally, the unsteady flow component is
> capable of handling dam break analysis, levee breaching and
> overtopping, pumping stations, navigation dam operations, and
> pressurized pipe systems. Further details of the unsteady flow
> component can be found in the manual provided with HEC-RAS (HEC,
> 2010).

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 4 covers hydrologic (storage) and hydraulic routing methods to
> predict flood movement for rivers and reservoirs. Hydrologic routing
> requires solution of the lumped continuity equation and a
> storage--outflow relation. The relation may be a function of both
> inflow and outflow for a river, but for a reservoir, storage is
> related only to outflow. Simple numerical methods are presented for
> solving the flood rout- ing equations through time.
>
> Hydraulic river routing is more complex than hydrologic routing in
> that both the one-dimensional continuity and the momentum equations
> must be solved. In many cases, the momentum equation may be simplified
> to Manning's equation; the procedure is called kinematic wave routing.
> Most practical kinematic wave solutions require numerical methods to
> compute actual hydrographs, such as those that are currently included
> in the HEC-HMS (HMS) Flood Hydrograph package or the Vflo model
> (Vieux, 2004).
>
> Full hydraulic (dynamic) routing requires solution of the Saint Venant
> equations, for which advanced numerical schemes must be employed to
> maintain mathematical stability and provide accurate solutions.
> Implicit finite-difference methods are the most commonly used
> techniques. One of the most accurate com- puter models for dynamic
> routing is DWOPER, which uses the four-point implicit method. DWOPER
> (as well as the newer NWS FLDWAV) has been extensively tested for
> floods on the Mississippi, Ohio, and Columbia Rivers with excellent
> results.
>
> The UNET model was developed by Barkau (1992) and has been incorpo-
> rated into the USACE HEC-RAS model in order to simulate
> one-dimensional unsteady flow through a full network of open channels
> (HEC, 2010). This model is currently widely used for applications to

    result of these assumptions, what are the shortcomings of the
    method?

    rout- ing method described in this chapter? What hydraulic
    conditions are neces- sary for kinematic wave assumptions to be
    valid for overland flow? What are advantages and disadvantages of
    using kinematic channel routing compared with solving the Saint
    Venant equations?

8.  Develop a Muskingum routing program in Excel, and repeat Problem
    4.7. Compare the results.

9.  Flood route the given input hydrograph through a linear reservoir
    (*S* = *KQ*), given *K* = 2.5 hr and Δ*t* = 1 hr. Solve one step
    beyond the peak outflow by developing a simple relation for
    computing outflow *Q*~2~, as a function of *Q*~1~, and inflows
    *I*~1~ and *I*~2~. Assume that storage and outflow are initially
    zero. Use the fact that *S* = *K*(*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*) and *I* - *Q*
    = Δ*S*\>Δ*t*. (*Hint:* Use the fact that the reservoir is linear to
    determine *x*).

10. A detention pond needs to be designed with a total capacity of 30
    ac-in. of stor- age. The inflow hydrograph for the pond is given in
    Figure P4--10. Assume that that pond is initially 50% full and
    outflow will cease when the pond is again 50% full. Graphically
    determine the peak outflow from the pond assuming a linear rise and
    fall in the outflow hydrograph. Draw the outflow hydrograph. At what
    time does outflow cease? (*Hint:* The outflow hydrograph will peak
    at the intersection of the inflow and the outflow hydrographs. Also,
    make use of the fact that the available volume for storage is equal
    to the area between the two triangular hydrographs and must be equal
    to 50% of the storage.)

12. A reservoir has a linear *S-Q* relationship of

*S* = *KQ*,

> where *K* = 1.3 hr. The inflow hydrograph for a storm event is given
> in the table.

a.  Develop a simple recursive relation using the continuity equation
    and *S-Q* relationship for the linear reservoir \[i.e., *aQ*~2~ =
    *bQ*~1~ + *cI*, where *a, b*, and *c* are constants and *I* =
    (*I*~1~ + *I*~2~)\>2\].

b.  Storage route the hydrograph through the reservoir using Δ*t* = 1
    hr.

c.  Explain why the shape of storage-discharge relations is usually not
    linear for actual reservoirs.

13. Given the reservoir with a storage-discharge relationship governed
    by the equation

*S* = *KQ*^3\>2^,

> route the inflow hydrograph for Problem 4.5 using storage routing
> techniques and a value of *K* = 1.31 for *Q* in m^3^/s and *S* in
> m^3^/s-hr. Discuss the differences in the outflow hydrograph for this
> reservoir and for the reservoir of Problem 4.12. Use Δ*t* = 1 hr.

14. A storm event occurred on Falls Creek Watershed that produced a
    rainfall pat- tern of 5 cm/hr for the first 10 min, 10 cm/hr in the
    second 10 min, and 5 cm/hr in the next 10 min. The watershed is
    divided into three subbasins (see Fig. P4--14), with the unit
    hydrographs given in the following table. Subbasins *A* and *B* had
    a loss rate of 2.5 cm/hr for the first 10 min and 1.0 cm/hr
    thereafter. Subbasin *C* had a loss rate of 1.0 cm/hr for the first
    10 min and 0 cm/hr thereafter. Using a simple lag routing method
    (time shift the hydrograph by *K*), determine the storm hydrograph
    at point 2. Assume a lag time *K* of 40 min.

20. Develop a new flood routing method for rectangular cross sections
    based on the Muskingum and storage indication techniques. Instead of
    using the Musk- ingum storage equation *S* = *f* (*K*, *x*, *I*,
    *Q*), use Manning's equation in the form where *a* and *m* are
    constants. Assume prismatic channel conditions at each time step,
    and derive the necessary equation for flood routing in a given rect-
    angular channel with length *L*, inflows *I*~1~ and *I*~2~, channel
    width *B*, and outflows *Q*~1~ and *Q*~2~. Manning's equation takes
    the form

> *Q* = *ay^m^*.

21. Equation (4--47) and Manning's equation (Eq. 4--48) can be combined
    to develop a second form of the kinematic wave equation \[Eq.
    (4--56)\], but in terms of *Q*.

    a.  Prove that the equation

> [0*Q*]{.underline} + *a*b*Q*^b-1^ [0*Q*]{.underline} = *q*
>
> 0*x* 0*t*
>
> is another form of the kinematic wave equation.

>
> Advances in computer hardware and software since the 1970s combined
> with larger and more extensive hydrologic data-monitoring efforts
> allowed for the development and application of a number of models in
> hydrology. These computer models can be used for a variety of purposes
> in simulating hydro- logic response under a number of assumptions
> within a watershed area. Such models incorporate various equations to
> describe hydrologic transport pro- cesses and storages and to account
> for water balances in space and time. Complex rainfall patterns and
> heterogeneous basins can be simulated with relative ease if watershed
> and hydrologic data are sufficient, and various design and control
> schemes can be tested with hydrologic models. HEC models will be
> highlighted in this chapter with detailed examples, and others are
> presented in Chapters 6, 9, and 11.
>
> Earlier chapters have presented a number of computational methods
> routinely used to convert rainfall into a storm hydrograph at the
> basin outlet. The rainfall--runoff process was presented in detail in
> Chapters 1 and 2, where we showed how input rainfall is distributed
> into various components of evap- oration, infiltration, detention or
> depression storage, overland flow, and
>
> **Table 5--1** Factors Affecting the Hydrograph
>
> eventually streamflow. The concept of the unit hydrograph was
> demonstrated converting rainfall over a watershed into associated
> runoff. Chapter 3 pre- sented various statistical methods for treating
> return frequency events such as rainfall or streamflow hydrologic
> series. Chapter 4 presented various flood routing methods within
> channels and rivers to move hydrographs from one point to another.
> Hydrologic models allow for hydrologic prediction in space and time
> through the use of well-known numerical methods.
>
> The actual shape and timing of the response hydrograph for a given
> watershed have been shown to be a function of many physiographic, land
> use, and meteorological variables, which are listed in Table 5--1.
> Rainfall intensity and duration are the major driving forces of the
> rainfall--runoff process, followed by watershed characteristics that
> translate the rainfall input into an output hydrograph at the outlet
> of the basin. Size, slope, shape, soils, and storage capacity are all
> important parameters in watershed geo- morphology. Land use and land
> cover parameters can significantly alter the natural hydrologic
> response through increases in impervious cover, altered slopes, and
> improved drainage channel networks.
>
> Major research programs by Harvard University, Stanford University,
> and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the 1960s were pioneering
> efforts to use early versions of digital computers to simulate
> watershed behavior on a continuous basis. The Stanford Watershed Model
> (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), which later evolved into HSPF
> (Hydrologic Simulation Program---FORTRAN) (Johanson et al., 1980; US
> EPA, 2007), was the first available major watershed model. Continuous
> models such as HSPF are based on long-term water-balance equations and
> thus account directly for effects of antecedent conditions.
>
> From these early efforts, a range of modeling approaches including
> event models was developed and applied during the 1970s for urban
> storm- water, floodplain hydrology, agricultural drainage, reservoir
> design, and river basin management. Much of the model development was
> driven by the interest in stream and lake water quality in urban
> runoff that surged during the 1970s.
>
> Single event models are designed to simulate rainfall--runoff from
> single storm events. Models such as the original HEC-1 Flood
> Hydrograph Package (HEC, 1981), the revised HEC-HMS (HEC, 1998, 2006,
> 2010) are widely used for floodplain analysis. The more sophisticated
> model was the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), developed in 1971
> for EPA to address in detail the quantity and quality variations in
> urban runoff (Metcalf et al., 1971). The SWMM model can be used for
> storm event or continuous simulation and has been through a number of
> updates and improvements over the years (Huber and Dickinson, 1988;
> SWMM5, 2005; Rossman, 2010). This model is considered one of the most
> comprehensive for simulating urban runoff dynamics, drainage design,
> hydraulic analysis, and nonpoint source water quality. With more
> demands from end users, the SWMM model was enhanced into a commercial
> modeling package---XP-SWMM (eXPert Stormwater and Wastewater
> Management Model) by XP Software (2010). Besides all the capabilities
> of SWMM, the XP-SWMM model has a better graphical user interface and
> the ability of linking the 1-D flow simulation to a 2-D overland flow
> model to generate floodplain maps.
>
> As an important addition to the water resources modeling field, the
> Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) Water and Environment, Inc., provides
> a whole suite of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling tools (MIKE URBAN,
> MIKE FLOOD, etc.) to address engineering problems of rainfall-runoff,
> pipe flows, overland flows, water quality, and sediment transport. For
> instance, the MIKE URBAN model enables users to simulate water,
> wastewater, and storm water in one integrated GIS-based framework that
> is powered by ESRI's ArcObjects components (DHI, 2011). The basic
> module of MIKE URBAN - Model Manager incorporates the U.S. EPA's fully
> dynamic storm water and waste water network modeling package (SWMM 5)
> and the stan- dard distribution network model (EPANET) to simulate
> hydraulics and water quality. In addition, the 2-D flow simulation
> module provides an easy and flexible tool for computing and
> visualizing the flows above and below ground in one fully integrated
> dynamic simulation.
>
> Hydrologic simulation models can be classified according to a wide
> range of characteristics, as shown in Table 5--2. For watershed
> analysis, the major categories of interest include lumped parameter
> vs. distributed parameter, event vs. continuous, and stochastic vs.
> deterministic. Lumped

> Distributed parameter models attempt to describe physical processes

> detail in Chapters 10 and 11 (i.e., Vflo) along with radar rainfall
> input and digital elevation methods for setting up grids to compute
> overland flow and channel flow.

> streamflow. The time series can then be statistically evaluated using
> flood frequency analysis. Hydrologic synthesis allows hydrologists to
> extend short historical records, such as streamflow, to longer
> sequences based on statistical methods. Syn- thetic sequences either
> preserve the statistical character of the historical record or follow
> a prescribed probability distribution, such as a lognormal or log
> Pearson type 3 (Section 3.5). Mass curve analysis assumes that his-
> torical records will repeat exactly. Random generations assume that
> succes- sive flows are independent and distributed according to a
> known probability distribution. Details on stochastic models can be
> found in Bras and Rodri- guez--Iturbe (1984), Stedinger et al. (1993),
> and Hirsch et al. (1993).

> A major advantage of simulation models is the insight gained by
> gather- ing and organizing data required as input to the mathematical
> algorithms that comprise the overall model system. This exercise can
> often guide the collection of additional data or direct the
> improvement of mathematical formulations to better represent watershed
> behavior. Another advantage is that many alterna- tive schemes for
> water supply systems, for urban development, or flood con- trol
> options can be quickly tested and compared with simulation models.
>
> The major limitation of simulation models is the inability to properly
> calibrate and verify applications in which input data are lacking.
> Current practice assumes that the simplest model that will
> satisfactorily describe the
>
> system for the given input data should be used. Model accuracy is
> largely determined by available input data and observed input and
> output time series at various locations in a watershed. Modern radar
> rainfall, hydrologic, and topographic datasets are now available for
> many areas, and model accu- racy has increased accordingly.
>
> Despite their limitations, simulation models still provide the most
> logical and scientifically advanced approach to understanding the
> hydrologic behavior of complex watershed and water resources systems.
> The availabil- ity of digital elevation datasets and radar rainfall
> data has opened a new era in the science of hydrology and has led to
> many new design and operating policies never realized or tested before
> (see Chapters 6, 9, 10, and 11). Sev- eral excellent reviews of models
> in hydrology have been published, including Maidment (1993), DeVries
> and Hromadka (1993), Hoggan (1997), James and James (1998a), and

> **STEPS IN WATERSHED MODELING**
>
> With so many hydrologic models available to the hydrologist or civil
> engi- neer, very little new model development is currently being
> supported. Rather, one must select one of the available simulation
> models based on characteristics of the system to be studied, the
> objectives to be met, and the available budget for data collection and
> analysis. Once the model is selected, the steps involved in watershed
> simulation analysis generally follow the sequence of Table 5--3.
>
> **Table 5--3** Steps in Watershed Modeling
>
> The selection of a model is a very difficult and important decision,
> since the success of the analysis hinges on accuracy of the results.
> Table 5--2 should be considered along with characteristics of the
> watershed, study objectives, and so on to develop a modeling plan. In
> general, unless digital watershed data are extensive in space and
> time, the usual approach to water- shed analysis is to use a
> deterministic event model with lumped parameter concepts for
> developing hydrographs and flood routing. The HEC-HMS (2006, 2010) is
> one of the most widely used models for typical watershed analysis to
> convert rainfall to runoff and streamflow. An Applications Guide was
> written in 2008 by Ford et al. to illustrate applications of HEC-HMS
> to studies on urban floods, flood frequency, flood loss reduction,
> flood warning, reservoir design, and environmental issues.
>
> If a watershed has extensive data available on rainfall, infiltration,
> baseflow, streamflow, and soils and land use, then HSPF from U.S. EPA
> BASINS (2007) can be applied for calculating continuous long-term
> water balances and outflow hydrographs. For the case of a well-defined
> urban drainage network, a distributed event model such as SWMM (Huber
> and Dickinson, 1988; James and 1998b; SWMM5, 2005; Rossman, 2010) can
> be applied to define hydrologic response for components throughout the
> sys- tem. Urban stormwater models are discussed in more detail in
> Section 5.3 and Chapter 6. Another GIS-based distributed model, Vflo,
> is presented in Chapter 11.
>
> Step 5 in Table 5--3, model calibration and verification, is important
> in fitting the model parameters and producing accurate and reliable
> results in steps 6 and 7. Model calibration involves selecting a
> measured set of input data (rainfall, channel routing, land use, and
> so on) and measured output hydrographs for model application. The
> controlling parameters in the model are adjusted until a "best fit" is
> obtained for this set of data. The model should then be "verified" by
> simulating a second or third event (i.e., different rainfall) and
> keeping all other parameters unchanged to produce a com- parison of
> predicted and measured hydrographs. A detailed example of the HEC-HMS
> model is described in Section 5.6, where an actual case study is
> highlighted to indicate difficulties and complexities that are often
> encoun- tered in watershed analyses.
>
> A selected number of the most popular event, continuous, and urban
> runoff models for hydrologic simulation are listed in Table 5--4.
> Universities or federal agencies supported the development of most of
> these models. Some of the models are very well documented and, as a
> result, have seen wide application to watersheds, especially in the
> United States. Others have been applied only to specific areas in the
> country. Extreme care and judgment must be exercised in applying any
> one of these models to areas where data exist to define UH and routing
> parameters.

> **DESCRIPTION OF MAJOR HYDROLOGIC MODELS**
>
> Several of the surface water models in Table 5--4 will be briefly
> reviewed below.
>
> The **HSPF** was the commercial successor to SWM-IV and was modi- fied
> to include water quality considerations, kinematic wave routing, and
> variable time steps. The current version is HSPF, which is a
> redesigned modular version that performs simulations of a variety of
> hydrologic and water quality processes on or under the land surface,
> in channels, and in reservoirs (Johanson et al., 1980). The HSPF model
> simulates both water- shed hydrology and water quality. It allows an
> integrated simulation of land and soil contaminant runoff processes
> with in-stream hydraulic and sediment-chemical interactions. The
> program provides a time history of runoff rate, sediment load, and
> nutrient and pesticide concentration, along with a time history of
> water quality and quantity at specific points in a watershed. HSPF
> computes a continuous hydrograph of streamflow at the basin outlet.
> Input is a continuous record of rainfall and evaporation data.
> Infiltration is divided into surface runoff and interflow, and deeper
> perco- lation to the ground water. Three soil moisture zones are
> included in the model. Total streamflow is a combination of overland
> flow, interflow, and ground water flow.
>
> One of the most useful modules in HSPF is the nonpoint-source model
> (NPS), which provides for continuous simulation of nonpoint pol-
> lutants from urban and undeveloped land surfaces. It is available as a
> separate model from EPA and has been extensively tested with HSP by
> the Northern Virginia Planning Commission. HSPF is the model of choice
> for evaluation of continuous runoff and nonpoint-source loads (EPA-
> BASINS, 2007). Originally introduced in 1996 with subsequent releases
> in 2001 and 2007, BASINS is a multipurpose environmental analysis
> system designed for use by regional, state, and local agencies in
> performing water- shed and water-quality-based studies. This system
> makes it possible to quickly assess large amounts of point-source and
> nonpoint-source data in

> HEC-HMS is a general flood hydrograph package with the following
> capabilities:

1.  Simulation of watershed runoff and streamflow from historical or
    > design rainfall

2.  Determination of flood flows at various locations for use in flood-
    > plain studies

3.  Evaluation of land use or topographic changes in a watershed area

4.  Simulation of flood control measures, such as reservoir storage and
    > channel options

5.  Computation of damage frequency curves and expected annual dam- ages
    > for various locations and multiple flood control plans

> **Watershed Delineation and Organization**
>
> HEC-HMS uses parameters averaged in space and time to simulate the
> runoff process. The size of subbasins, routing reaches, or computation
> interval is selected based on the basin physiography, available
> rainfall data, available streamflow data, and required accuracy. A
> watershed is subdi- vided into small and relatively homogeneous
> subbasins according to drain- age divides based on mapped or digital
> topography, as shown in Figure 5--1. The size of a subbasin should
> generally be in the range of 1--10 mi^2^ because of limitations of UH
> theory, especially in urban areas. Routing reaches are identified, and
> the overall order of the runoff computation is defined (from upstream
> to downstream) for input to HEC. Routing reaches should be long enough
> so that a flood wave will not travel faster than the computation time
> step. Otherwise, numerical errors in flood calculations will occur.
> Simple routing methods described in Sections 4.1 to 4.3 are contained
> in HEC-HMS.
>
> **Precipitation**
>
> Precipitation *P* is computed for each subbasin in Figure 5--1 using
> his- torical data or synthetic design storms. The model allows for (1)
> incre- mental *P* (depth of *P* for each time interval) for each
> subbasin, (2) total cumulative *P* and a time distribution, or (3)
> historical gage data together with areal weighting (Thiessen)
> coefficients for each subbasin. Standard design storms can be used in
> the form of (1) depth vs. duration data,
>
> \(2\) probable maximum precipitation, or (3) standard project
> precipita- tion. The precipitation data must be input at a constant
> time interval, but this interval may be different from the
> computational time interval in the model. Precipitation inputs are
> described for HEC-HMS in Section 5.5, and a detailed example is
> contained in Section 5.6 for a complex water- shed. Figure 5--2 shows
> a typical basin model for the HEC-HMS model indicating various
> subareas and river reaches that connect the subareas together.
>
> HEC-HMS is capable of simulating snowfall and snowmelt. Up to 10
> elevation zones of equal increments may be specified in each subbasin.
> Usually, an elevation increment of 1000 ft is used, but any increment
> may be specified as long as the air-temperature lapse rate corresponds
> to the change in elevation within the zone. Snowmelt occurs when the
> tem- perature is equal to or greater than the melt temperature and is
> calcu- lated by either the degree-day method or an energy budget
> method (see Section 2.9). For more detail on snowfall and snowmelt
> calculations, see the HEC user's manual (HEC, 2010) and *Runoff from
> Snowmelt* (U.S. ACOE, 1960). Dingman (2002) covers snowmelt in more
> detail with examples.

> **Loss Rate Analysis**
>
> HEC contains several methods for computing the loss of precipitation
> to interception and infiltration, as shown in Table 5--5. The simplest
> is the initial and constant loss rate function, in which the initial
> loss volume is satisfied before the constant loss rate begins. The
> remaining constant loss is identical to the f index method for
> infiltration (see Section 2.7) and is often used in design storm
> analysis or where data are insufficient to allow calculation with more
> sophisticated methods.
>
> **Table 5--5** HEC-HMS Loss Methods
>
> The SCS method employs the SCS curve number, CN, which is directly
> related to land use and hydrologic soil properties of a watershed. The
> SCS approach relates accumulated rainfall excess or runoff to accu-
> mulated rainfall with CN (see Section 2.5). It is popular because of
> its application to ungaged areas and its large empirical database. The
> method requires input of CN, initial abstraction, and percent
> imperviousness (McCuen, 2005).
>
> The Green and Ampt method was added to HEC in 1990 and prob- ably is
> one of the best estimates for infiltration, since the parameters are
> all measurable and directly related to soil types in a watershed.
> Version 3.5 of HMS uses four different parameters to apply the method;
> it is necessary to measure or estimate hydraulic conductivity,
> capillary suction at the wetting front, initial moisture content, and
> saturated moisture content (see Section

8.  for Green and Ampt and Table 2--4 for data). These parameters can be
    estimated effectively using physical soil characteristics, such as
    soil texture class and major soil horizon classification.
    Calculation of these parameters assumes that the soil is a
    homogeneous medium with uniform initial mois- ture content. The
    Green and Ampt method has received significant atten- tion in recent
    years with the release of HEC-HMS. For example, the TSARP program
    instituted in Houston, TX, after T.S. Allison flooding uti- lized
    the Green and Ampt methods in modeling 22 different watersheds (see
    Appendix E).

> **Subbasin Runoff Calculation**
>
> Several methods for surface runoff or transform computations in HEC
> are available in the model and can be selected by the user. These are
> presented in Table 5--6 and include the UH methods of Clark *TC & R*
> (1945), Snyder (1938), and the Soil Conservation Service (SCS, 1984,
> 1986). Known UHs

> can also be directly input. The kinematic wave overland flow
> computation was added to HEC in 1981 and allows more accurate
> representation of urbanized areas for UH calculations (HEC, 1981).
> Kinematic wave methods are described in more detail in Section 4.6. A
> similar setup for conversion of rainfall to runoff exists for HEC-HMS
> (Section 5.5).
>
> Clark's method is based on the time--area curve method described in
> Chapter 2. The time--area histogram, determined from isochrones of the
> watershed, or contours from points at which water arrives at the same
> time, is convoluted with a unit design storm hyetograph to yield the
> hydro- graph, which is then routed through linear reservoir storage to
> allow for peak attenuation. The Clark-method parameters are the time
> of concen- tration and the storage coefficient *R*, defined in Section
> 2.5. Hoggan (1997) provides more details on the Clark method, and
> Table 5--10 presents empirical *TC* and *R* equations derived for
> Houston, TX (within Harris County).
>
> The HEC model uses a synthetic time--area curve derived from a gen-
> eralized basin shape, and the equations are applicable to most basins:

*AI* = 1.414*T*^1.5^, 0 ... *T* 6 0.5, (5--1)

1 - *AI* = 1.414(1 - *T*)^1.5^, 0.5 6 *T* 6 1. (5--2)

> where *AI* is the cumulative area as a fraction of subbasin area and
> *T* is fraction of time of concentration, *T~c~*. Specific time--area
> curves can also be input to HEC model if they can be computed from
> some other GIS-type method.
>
> The computed hydrograph based on a time--area method is routed through
> a linear reservoir (Section 4.3) to produce the final UH. A family of
> 2-hr UHs generated by HEC is shown in Figure 5--3 for a 4.3-mi^2^
> basin with *TC* = 0.45 hr. Note the wide range of hydrograph shapes
> that can be produced by the two-parameter UH. An SCS UH is shown for
> comparison. The larger the value of *R* (*TC* + *R*), the flatter the
> UH response, more typical of natural watersheds with flat slopes.
> Thus, the smaller ratios cor- respond to more urbanized watersheds.
> The steepest hydrograph could also represent a basin with steep slopes
> and a small amount of storage (Hoggan, 1997).

Time (hr)

> Snyder's method (Section 2.3) provides time to peak *t~p~* and peaking
> coefficient *C~p~*, which are insufficient to produce the curved shape
> of the hydrograph. Clark's method is therefore used to help smooth and
> define the shape of the hydrograph corresponding to Snyder's
> coefficients within the HEC model. The direct runoff ordinates are
> then calculated by convo- lution of the UH with the net precipitation
> for the subbasin.
>
> The kinematic wave process, described in more detail in Section 4.6,
> represents a nonlinear runoff response compared with linear UH
> methods. The kinematic wave method relies on parameters that are
> generally measur- able from a basin, such as slope, land use, lengths,
> channel shape, roughness, and area. Overland flow, collector, and main
> channel elements are used to represent the characteristics of a
> drainage basin (Fig. 4--9). In the method, the main equations are
> Manning's equation of flow and continuity \[Eqs. (4--47) and
> (4--48)\]. These are solved numerically to produce overland flow as a
> function of time and space. The same equations are solved for channel
> elements (Fig. 4--9). The kinematic wave (KW) method is more
> applicable to the analysis of urban basins, since KW theory does not
> provide for the attenuation of flood waves. The area of the subbasin
> is required along with *L*, *S*, *n*, shape, and size, and any
> upstream hydrograph to be routed in the reach. KW routing is also
> available in the main channel. Chapter 11 presents a section on
> distributed modeling with VFLO using kinematic wave methods (Vieux,
> 2004).
>
> **Baseflow Calculation**
>
> HEC-HMS simulates baseflow of a flood hydrograph with three
> parameters:
>
> \(1\) *Q*~0~, flow in channel prior to start of rising limb; (2) ratio
> of recession flows at t=1 (RTIOR), exponential decay rate; and (3)

> decay rate RTIOR is equal to the slope of the line, and *Q~R~ Q*~peak~
> is usually in the range of 0.05 to 0.15.
>
> Equation (5--3) defines the parameters that are used in the model, in
> which the recession flow threshold *Q~R~* and the decay constant RTIOR
> must be specified by the user. Figure 5--4 defines the relation
> between the stream- flow hydrograph and user-defined parameters.
> Equation (5--3) computes recession flow *Q* as

where

> *Q* = *Q*~0~(RTIOR)^-*n*Δ*t*^, (5--3)
>
> *Q*~0~ = starting baseflow prior to the rising limb,
>
> *Q* = baseflow rate at end of *n*Δ*t*,
>
> RTIOR = ratio of recession flows at *t* = 1 hr increment apart.
>
> Many applications of HEC are for major urban flood events, where base-
> flow is a relatively small percentage of the total hydrograph flow. Of
> course, baseflow can be entered as a constant value or as zero.
> Several possibilities exist for computing baseflow in HEC-HMS (Section
> 5.5).
>
> **Flood Routing**
>
> Flood routing involves analyzing the movement of a flood wave as it
> travels from reach to reach through a stream or river. Table 5--7
> lists the major methods of flood routing that are available in HEC-HMS
> (see Chapter 4), where both storage-indication reservoir and river
> routing methods were cov- ered. The Muskingum method requires a *K*
> and *x*, where *K* can be obtained from analyses shown in Section 4.2
> or using the reach length divided by the wave velocity determined from
> Equation (4--38). *dQ dy* can be obtained
>
> **Table 5--7** Flood Routing in HEC-HMS
>
> from the slope of the rating curve at a typical discharge value to be
> routed. To avoid numerical instability, note that for the Muskingum
> method, 2*Kx* 6 Δ*t* ... *K* and number of subreaches = *K* Δ*t*,
> where *K* = travel time and Δ*t* = time interval.
>
> The Modified Puls method was briefly presented in Section 4.3 for a
> reservoir but can also be applied for rivers by developing a
> storage--dis- charge *S-Q* relation. One of several methods can be
> used: (1) steady-flow profile computation, (2) observed profiles, (3)
> normal depth profiles,

(4) storage from inflow and outflow hydrographs, and (5) optimization
    tech- niques. These are described in more detail in Hoggan (1997)
    and will not be repeated here. For method 1, several water surface
    profiles are generated: *WS*~1~ to *WS*~5~, corresponding to
    discharges, and *Q*~1~ to *Q*~5~, using the HEC-RAS program (Chapter
    7). The storage volumes are computed from cross-sectional areas of
    the channel and their lengths for each *WS~i~*. An *S-Q* curve
    (rating curve) is determined (Fig. 5--5). The number of routing
    steps to be used for

> a river reach is NSTEPs, equal to *K* Δ*t*. This is a numerical
> parameter related to flood wave speed vs. the computational time step
> so that numeri- cal stability is maintained. The greater the storage
> in a reach per unit of flow, the greater the attenuation of the flood
> wave as it is routed through (see Section 5.6 for detailed example).
>
> The kinematic wave channel routing method does not allow flood peak
> attenuation, which is a problem where the floodplain is extensive.
> Thus, KW can overestimate flows compared to other methods. But it has
> the advantage of allowing for laterally distributed inflow along the
> main channel (HEC, 1990). Manning's equation forms the basis for the
> kinematic wave method, as described in detail in Section 4.6. All of
> the above flood routing methods exist for HEC-HMS and any one of them
> can be selected in the flood routing setup options. Vflo in Chapter 11
> is a good example where KW overland flow combined with storage routing
> in channels can provide accurate results for most watersheds.

>
> **The Basin Model**
>
> The basin model contains the basin and routing parameters of the model
> as well as connectivity data for the basin. The GUI uses a simple
> click-and-drag method to place subbasins, reaches, reservoirs,
> junctions, diversions, sources, and sinks together to form the
> watershed. Each element can be given a name and description, and the
> user may select the method of calculation to be used by the model. The
> basin model is merely a representation of the actual watershed, and
> the visual location and sizes of each element do not matter as long as
> the numerical data and connectivity are correct. HEC-HMS then connects
> some objects placed at either end of routing reaches. Multiple ele-
> ments can connect downstream to one element, but one element cannot
> have multiple downstream connections. The user must be careful to
> connect
>
> objects in the correct direction of flow, which can be checked by
> selecting the option to show flow directions from the toolbar. A
> series of icons are used to represent the various elements within the
> model such as subbasin, routing reach, junction, reservoir, or outlet
> and are arranged in a horizontal line beneath the main menu. The icon
> representations for subbasins and junctions can be identified in basin
> model in Figure 5--6(a).
>
> **Subbasins** represent the physical areas within the basin and
> produce a discharge hydrograph at the outlet of their respective
> areas. The hydrograph produced is calculated from precipitation data
> minus the losses. The result- ing precipitation excess is transformed
> using a UH methodology to compute runoff at the outlet, which is then
> added to baseflow. Each component can be calculated using several
> methods. The area, loss rate, runoff, and baseflow inputs for each
> subbasin are entered into the basin model for each one using the
> Watershed Explorer.
>
> **Loss rates** can be simulated by one of several methods. For event
> mod- eling, techniques include initial and constant, SCS curve number,
> gridded SCS curve number, and Green and Ampt methods. The one-layer
> deficit and constant model can be used for simple continuous modeling.
> For modeling of complex infiltration and evapotranspiration
> environments, the five-layer soil moisture accounting model can be
> used. The method is changed in a simple menu-driven window, and the
> input data are entered on the "Loss" tab in the editor (Fig. 5--6(a)).
>
> **Transform methods**, which convert rainfall excess into surface
> runoff, can also be simulated using a variety of tools. HEC-HMS
> includes the pop- ular Clark TC & R and SCS UH techniques, as well as
> the Snyder Method or user specified UH. Spatially distributed runoff
> can be computed with the quasi-distributed linear transform of
> cell-based precipitation and infiltration. The Modified Clark method
> (ModClark) is a linear quasi-distributed UH method that can be used
> with gridded precipitation data. If the ModClark transform with
> gridded rainfall is used, a file that contains characteristics of
> subbasin grid cells is required. HEC-HMS can handle grid cell
> depiction of the watershed for distributed runoff computations. The
> kinematic wave method with multiple planes and channels is also
> included (see Chapter 4 for detail). Input data are entered in a
> simple menu-driven window.
>
> **Baseflow** takes into account normal flow through a channel or the
> effects of ground water. HEC-HMS offers two methods for baseflow
> calcu- lation: recession and constant monthly. The recession method is
> an expo- nential decay function of a defined starting baseflow. For
> the constant monthly method, the user simply enters a constant
> baseflow value for each month. No baseflow is also an option, and in
> simple hydrologic models over short time periods or highly urbanized
> basins with channels, baseflow can usually be neglected.
>
> **Flood routing** in HEC-HMS offers a number of options for the
> reaches and routing of flood hydrographs. The Muskingum method can be
> used for general routing; routing with no attenuation can be modeled
> with the lag
>
> method. The most popular and accurate is the Modified Puls method,
> which can be used to model a reach with a user-specified
> storage--outflow relation- ship. The S-Q relationship is derived from
> a hydraulics model such as HEC- RAS (Chapter 7).
>
> Channels with trapezoidal, rectangular, triangular, or circular cross
> sections can be modeled with Modified Puls, the kinematic wave or
> Musk- ingum--Cunge method (see Chapter 4). Channels with overbank
> areas can be modeled with the Muskingum--Cunge eight-point method,
> which takes coordinates at eight points in a cross section of the
> channel. The addition of options for subbasins and reaches allows
> different users to run HMS using the methods most appropriate to their
> watersheds. Input data are entered in a simple menu-driven window
> within Watershed Explorer. Homework problems in this chapter expand
> upon this further.
>
> **Reservoirs** store the inflow from upstream elements and produces an
> outflow hydrograph based on a monotonically increasing
> storage--outflow relationship. A reservoir can be entered with one of
> three possible types of relationships: storage vs. outflow, elevation
> vs. storage vs. outflow, or eleva- tion vs. area vs. outflow. The
> outflow structure must be well understood in order to develop an
> accurate storage--discharge relation. The inflow entering the
> reservoir must be contained with the minimum and maximum values of the
> data entered. The user must also select an initial condition of
> storage, elevation, outflow, or select inflow equal to outflow. The
> model assumes that elements have a level pool, such as ponds, lakes,
> or reservoirs. The effect of adding a detention pond to a basin can be
> modeled by using a reservoir. The input window for a reservoir is used
> to relate storage to outflow. A reservoir icon is used to represent
> storage at any point in the watershed and is then connected downstream
> to a junction.
>
> **Sources** are elements that represent a discharge into the basin as
> an observed hydrograph or a hydrograph generated by a previous
> simulation. They often are used to represent inflow from reservoirs,
> unmodeled head- water regions, or a watershed outside the region. This
> may be entered as gage data or a constant discharge. **Sinks** are
> elements that have an inflow and no outflow. The only inputs are the
> name and description of the sink. It may represent the lowest point of
> the drainage area or the outlet.
>
> **Diversions** for hydrologic models use a simple table relating
> inflow to diverted flow and routed flow. These relationships can be
> determined using geometric calculations and hydraulic models.
> Diversions will have two "downstream" connections, one being the
> routed path and the other the diverted path. The user specifies the
> diverted flow through the use of a table (inflow-diversion), and
> whatever flow is not diverted will travel the main path. If the
> "connected" option is selected, then the diverted flow will return to
> the watershed at the downstream location.
>
> Figure 5--6(a) shows a typical basin model with a mapfile in the back-
> ground. In very complicated watersheds where icons are often too
> crowded to display all labels, the user can identify objects by
> clicking on the buttons
>
> in the toolbar of the basin model. The selected item will be
> highlighted gray in the basin model. The toolbar also contains a
> magnifying button to zoom into a selected area, and the user can zoom
> out of an area by going to "Zoom Out" under View in menu the main
> menu. Objects can only be selected using the arrow tool.
>
> **The Meteorologic Model**
>
> The meteorologic model contains the precipitation data, either
> historical or hypothetical, for the HEC-HMS model. The model contains
> a number of options for modeling precipitation and can also account
> for evapotranspira- tion. Examples of historical precipitation inputs
> include hyetographs, gage weighting, and inverse-distance gage
> weighting (Fig. 5--6(b)). The program can handle an unlimited number
> of recording and nonrecording gages, and gage data can be entered
> manually, imported from an existing DSS file, or based on an Excel
> file, as described later. In addition, HEC-HMS has the capability to
> model gridded rainfall, such as NEXRAD-estimated radar rainfall
> (Chapters 11 and 12). Hypothetical precipitation data can be used for
> design storms based on frequency storm analysis and standard project
> storm (SPS) models. Figure 5--6(c) presents an example of how the
> 100-year frequency storm for Houston, TX, would be inputed into the
> model. Note that by clicking on the meteorological model the user can
> select the type of storm (Fig. 5--6(b)), and by clicking on the type
> of storm directly beneath the meteorological model the user can edit
> the specifications for that storm (Fig. 5--6(c)).

> each independent modeling run. A series of runs can be easily
> organized using this option with several different scenarios. HEC-HMS
> can also handle continuous hydrograph simulation over long periods. It
> is standard to run the model several days past the end of the storm to
> ensure that the falling limb of the computed hydrograph is completely
> captured.
>
> **Data Handling**
>
> A major improvement for HEC-HMS is the use of the Data Storage System,
> or HEC-DSS, used to manage time-series and tabular data. The system
> was the result of a need in hydrologic engineering to store a variety
> of types of data in a standardized format. Previously, data formatted
> for one program would need to be entered into another format for a
> different program by hand by each user. Each program would then use
> separate functions to ana- lyze and graph the data. The HEC-DSS
> software is the result of an effort to make hydrologic data management
> more efficient and allow for the HEC family of programs to use the
> same database.
>
> HEC-HMS stores all its output in a DSS file and can store much of its
> tabular or time-series input data in one or more DSS files. For
> example, reservoir storage--outflow relationships as well as
> precipitation and observed flow time-series data are stored in a DSS
> file. The user either can input the data manually into HEC-HMS using
> the appropriate dialog boxes or can tell HMS to access the data from a
> DSS file where they are stored. HEC-HMS can use more than one DSS file
> for a project. There is always one DSS file associated with the
> project, which stores output. A second DSS file (or more) can hold
> precipitation and observed flow data as well as other user- entered
> data (see user's manual for more detail).
>
> While the HEC-DSS software package is an improved means of man- aging
> hydrologic data, there is no easy way to transfer the data from a
> spreadsheet to a HEC-DSS file. HEC-DSS utility software available for
> download from the USACE website given in Appendix E will allow import
> and export of data from text files for input to HEC-HMS.
>
> **Running HEC-HMS and Viewing Results**
>
> The user may specify different data sets for each component within a
> project and then run the hydrologic simulation using different
> combinations of mod- els. For example, one can run a 10-year or a
> 100-year frequency storm model using the same basin model and control
> specifications to compare the result- ing flows. Or, one can model the
> effects of adding diversions and reservoirs to a basin by saving it
> under a different name, altering the new basin model, and running the
> simulation under the same precipitation and control speci- fications.
> With several basin models saved in the same project, running
> simulations with various models is a simple task. In order to create
> the sce- nario for a particular run, go to "Simulation run" under
> Compute in the main
>
> file menu. Select one basin model, one meteorologic model, and one
> control specification. Then run the scenario by selecting "Select
> run," and subse- quently "Compute run," both of which are under
> Compute in the main file menu. If changes are made to one of the
> models after a run with the same configuration has been calculated,
> select the correct run to recalculate. Note that the "Compute" tab
> beneath the Watershed Explorer allows the user to easily select
> different runs.
>
> Results can be viewed by going to the "Results" tab beneath the
> Watershed Explorer, clicking on any object (e.g., subbasin or
> junction) in the basin model, and selecting from the menu. The program
> gives the result- ing times and flows for each basin element and its
> immediate upstream ele- ments in the form of a graph, summary table,
> or time-series table. The graph shows time vs. flow, the summary table
> shows peak flows and corresponding times, and the time-series table
> gives the inflow and outflow for each time step. For subbasins, HMS
> also shows the precipitation, loss, excess, and base- flow in each
> form of viewing results. Junction plots show tributary hydro- graphs
> and their combined result. Examples of resulting hydrographs are
> presented at the end of Section 5.6. Subbasin output hydrographs
> plotted with rainfall can be obtained by clicking on the appropriate
> icon. Summary table information is also available for each junction or
> subarea.
>
> **Other Features**
>
> HEC-HMS includes advanced features such as parameter estimation with
> optimization, soil moisture accounting, GIS and grid-cell hydrology,
> snow- melt simulation, and improved hydraulics. HEC-GeoHMS is a
> companion program that allows for the creation of HEC-HMS projects
> from GIS sources, including digital elevation models, land use data,
> and other elec- tronic sources (see Chapter 10).
>
> The parameter estimation and optimization function is used to com-
> pare resulting hydrographs to observed hydrographs, so at least one
> element in the basin must have observed data. The program
> automatically estimates the parameters in order to find the best fit
> of the generated hydrograph to the observed one for one element. It
> allows the user to set initial values for the parameters of each
> element along with maximum and minimum values so that the parameter
> values estimated by the program must fall in a reason- able range. The
> optimization function measures the degree of variation between the two
> hydrographs based on four possible choices: peak-weighted RMS error,
> sum of squared residuals, sum of absolute values, or percent error in
> peak flow. The program is run iteratively until the user is satisfied
> with the objective function value, which is zero if the hydrographs
> match identically.
>
> The development of HEC-HMS is a project that continues to evolve with
> time; users should periodically check the HEC U.S. Army Corp of
> Engineer's (ACOE) website for updates. For further information and
> help
>
> with HEC-HMS, the user's manual can be downloaded from the HEC web-
> site: [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil.](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/)
> The latest updates and other informa- tion can be found on the ACOE's
> web page (see Appendix E for more details). Version 3.5 is a
> significant improvement over earlier versions and is available to
> anyone for free (see Appendix E).
>
> **EXAMPLE 5--1**
>
> **SMALL-WATERSHED EXAMPLE (HEC-HMS)**
>
> A small undeveloped watershed has the parameters listed in the accom-
> panying tables. A unit hydrograph and Muskingum routing coefficients
> are known for subbasin 3, shown in Figure E5--1(a). *TC* and *R*
> values (Clark UH from Table 5.10) for subbasins 1 and 2 and associated
> SCS curve numbers (CN) are provided as shown. A 5-hr rainfall
> hyetograph in in./hr is shown in Figure E5--1(b) for a storm event
> that occurred on May 5, 2011. Assume that the rain fell uniformly over
> the watershed. Use the information given to develop a HEC-HMS input
> data set to model this storm. Run the model to determine the predicted
> outflow at point *B*.

    **Select Run** and **5May11**. Next, select **Compute** (main menu)
    and *Compute Run \[5May2011\]*.

23. Click the **Results** tab in the Watershed Explorer window, expand
    the Simulation Runs item and click on any of the elements to view
    the simulation results.

> **Watershed Description**
>
> This section analyzes streamflow in a hypothetical watershed,
> Winterday Creek (Fig. 5--7(a)), and the separate effects of adding a
> detention pond and a diversion. The watershed, with a total area of
> about 10.99 mi^2^, is made up of four subbasins with varying sets of
> hydrologic parameters. In their existing condition, the subbasins in
> this watershed range from 18% imperviousness (subbasin 2) to 60%
> imperviousness (subbasin 4). The subbasins are relatively flat (10 to
> 20 ft/mi) and range in size from 2.0 to 4.3 mi^2^ (see Table 5.8(a)).
>
> **Physical Parameters**
>
> The physical parameters for each of the subbasins in the hypothetical
> watershed are shown in Tables 5--8(a,b), Theoretically, parameters of
> main interest such as channel slopes, channel lengths, percent
> develop- ment, and percent conveyance (the ratio of flow in the

>
> The HEC-HMS model can accept rainfall data in a number of ways: his-

> data. When using data from gages spaced unevenly across a given
> watershed, the gage values should be weighted accordingly. The

> The 10-yr and 100-yr synthetic 24-hr design storms for the Houston
> area are depicted in Table 5--9 and Figure 5--8 (TSARP, 2002). For
> example, the HEC-HMS model accepts input data for the 15-min, 2-hr,
> 3-hr, 6-hr, 12-hr, and 24-hr total design rainfalls, and then
> distributes the data as a bar graph by centering the maximum at a
> user-specified point in time (i.e., 33%, 50%, 67%, or 75% of storm
> duration), according to agency standards. Thus, one can input any
> design rainfall into HEC-HMS, calculate the outflow hydrograph, and
> compare the result with a given historical rainfall. In this way, one
> can deter- mine the approximate frequency of occurrence of the

>
> In the case study of Winterday Creek, the Clark (*TC* & *R*) method
> will be used to illustrate its applications to an urban watershed. The
> *TC* & *R* method is summarized in Table 5--10 with empirical
> equations that have been devel- oped for the Harris County (Houston)
> area in Texas. The equations used here are based on the analysis of a
> number of watersheds along the Texas Gulf Coast (Harris County Flood
> Control District, 1983; TSARP, 2002). Many similar equations have been
> generated for other urban areas and regions across the country, and
> the user of HEC-HMS is strongly urged to evaluate the *TC* & *R*
> method carefully before applying it to any ungaged watersheds.
>
> The physical parameters presented in Table 5--8 were used to develop
> the values for *TC* & *R* shown in Table 5--11. Generally, the lower
> the percent development and percent conveyance in a subbasin, the
> higher the value of *TC* & *R*. Thus, subbasin 2 has the highest value
> of *TC* & *R* and has the flat- test UH response. Individual values
> for each subbasin are input into HEC- HMS using the transform tab in
> the subbasin editor. Note also that SCS Curve Number method was
> selected for infiltration losses and the corre- sponding parameters
> were inserted in the subbasin editor under the loss rate tab (Table
> 5--8(b)).
>
> **Hydrograph and Channel Routing**
>
> The HEC-HMS model calculates outflow hydrographs for each subbasin
> based on unit hydrographs. For this watershed, the flood hydrographs
> from subbasins 1 and 2 are computed for the outlet of those subbasins
> (point *A* in Fig. 5--7(a)). The storm hydrograph from subbasin 3 is
> assumed to occur at point *B*, and the hydrograph from subbasin 4 is
> assumed to occur at point *C*. It is therefore required that the
> combined hydrograph from subbasins 1 and 2 at point *A* be flood
> routed through reach *AB* and then combined with the
>
> **Table 5--10** Equations for *TC* & *R* Method for Houston, Texas
>
> The method requires that (*TC* + *R*) and *TC* are computed from the
> following formulas, then
>
> *R* is found by subtraction of the two, where *R* = (*TC* + *R*) -

> **Resulting Hydrographs**
>
> The HEC-HMS model was run using data presented in the tables above and
> using the Clark (*TC* & *R*) method. Two different rainfalls were
> tested: the 10-yr frequency design storm and the 100-yr frequency
> design storm. The rainfall input datasets used for the 10-yr and
> 100-yr design storms are shown in Table 5--9 and Figure 5--8.
> Resulting peak outflows for both storms are listed in Table 5--13. In
> general, it is always useful to check three parameters against the
> measured gage data in calibrating HEC-HMS input: peak flow, volume
> under the hydrograph, and time to peak. Some adjustment of water- shed
> parameters is usually necessary to calibrate the model fully.
>
> Once the HEC-HMS input data are calibrated for several measured storm
> events, predictions for the 10-yr, 100-yr, or any other design storm
> can be made by changing rainfall input in the model (see Problems
> 5.6--5.9). The resulting 10-yr and 100-yr design storm hydrographs
> then provide an esti- mate of peak flows at various points along the
> main channel. These flows can be used with cross-section data and
> hydraulic computations to derive elevations for the 10-yr and 100-yr
> floodplain using HEC-RAS as described in Chapter 7.
>
> As with any modeling exercise, sources of error in the calibration of
> HEC-HMS to a watershed include the following:

1.  Spatially variable input rainfall with too few rain gages across the
    > watershed

2.  Infiltration or loss inaccuracies due to variable rainfall or
    > changing land use

3.  Inaccurate estimates of routing coefficients for channels

4.  Nonlinear hydrographs that cannot be properly represented by lin-
    > ear unit hydrograph theory

> **Flood Control Alternatives**
>
> Once a watershed has been evaluated under existing conditions of land
> use and channel morphology, the HEC-HMS model can be used to test
> flood control plans that might include a reservoir or detention pond
> to increase storage in the watershed. Some diversion of part of the
> flow to another watershed where storage is available might also be
> possible. These possi- bilities are investigated with HEC-HMS in this
> section.
>
> A powerful feature of the HEC-HMS model is its ability to represent
> changes in watershed physiography or land use that may occur as a
> water- shed develops. For Winterday Creek, we will consider two
> examples: (1) a large detention pond at point *B* for the storage of
> flood waters from sub- basins 1, 2, and 3, and (2) the diversion of a
> portion of the flow at point *B* into a diversion channel that leads
> to another watershed. In both cases, the watershed will be assumed to
> have existing land use (Fig. 5--7(b)).
>
> To input a detention pond into HEC-HMS, the storage routing data must
> be changed to represent the storage--discharge relation for the
> particu- lar detention pond. The pond data are located in the input
> through logical placement so that all contributing hydrographs route
> through the pond. The starting water elevation in the pond depends on
> the operation of the system. The discharge characteristics can be
> considered in detail through options available in the model, but
> generally pipe flow is assumed for low flows and weir flow for flood
> levels. Details on equations that govern such flows are provided in
> Chapters 4 and 7.
>
> The input data of the detention pond in HEC-HMS are depicted in Table
> 5--14. The storage--discharge data are based on pond geometry, which
> is a func- tion of available land area and available outfall depth.
> The existing 100-yr peak flow in the water is 4197 cfs at point *B*
> and 9024 cfs at the outlet (*C*). To control the peak flows at the
> point B and at the outlet of the watershed, a pond was located just
> upstream of point *B* along the stream (Fig. 5--7(b)). Table 5--15
> shows the relative effects of this pond compared with existing
> conditions. Add- ing a pond yields a 50% reduction in peak flow at the
> 100-yr level through the pond and a 24% reduction in peak flow through
> point *C* (Fig. 5--9).

> A second alternative for flood control is **diversion** of flood

> flow level above which a certain percentage will be diverted from the
> main channel (Table 5--16(a)). While this option implies that there
> must be an adjacent watershed or stor- age area that can receive the
> excess flood water, it can be a viable alternative in some cases. For

> One final exercise with the HEC-HMS model application to this
> watershed is a consideration of full development conditions in the
> water- shed, which is consistent with the future conditions in
> Houston. As the watershed proceeds to full urbanization, significant
> changes in UH and loss rate parameters will be needed in the model.
> There would also be associ- ated channelization of laterals and the
> main stream, which may require changes in the routing parameters in
> the model. From the previous discus- sion of effects of urbanization,
> it should be clear that full development will worsen the flood
> problem, especially downstream. Homework problem 5.5 explores this
> issue in more detail. Once developed, the HEC-HMS model for a
> watershed can be used to evaluate a number of scenarios for flood
> management and control.
>
> **SUMMARY** Simulation models in hydrology have been developed and
> applied over the last four decades with remarkable success. These
> models incorporate various equa- tions to describe hydrologic
> processes in space and time. Complex rainfall pat- terns affecting
> large watersheds can be simulated, and computer models can be used to
> test various design and control schemes. A selected number of the most
> popular rainfall--runoff models for hydrologic simulation are
> contained in Table 5--4. Models of some note include HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS,
> HSPF, SWMM, and Vflo and are some of the most popular and
> comprehensive models for detailed water- shed analysis**.**
>
> The second half of the chapter is devoted to a detailed presentation
> of HEC- HMS developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, considered
> by many to be the most versatile and most often used hydrologic model.
> It is the model of choice for most floodplain computations performed
> in the United States by various agencies such as FEMA and local
> drainage districts (HEC, 2006, 2010). Homework problems 5.1--5.12
> concern a detailed case study and application of HEC-HMS to an urban
> watershed in Houston, Texas. Input data for the model are developed,
> using the Clark UH methods (*TC* & *R*), Muskingum Routing method,
> rain gage data, and several design storms, and the results from each
> are compared. The problems also introduce the effects of development
> within a watershed and explore the Green and Ampt method to account
> for infiltration losses. Several flood control alternatives are
> modeled, including flow diversion and detention ponds at critical
> locations, to demonstrate the overall capabili- ties of the HEC-HMS
> program.
>
> **PROBLEMS** *Problems 5.1 through 5.12 deal with a hypothetical
> watershed with the following pa- rameters. Problems 5.1 through 5.5
> involve input data setup only, while Problems 5.6 through 5.12 require
> actual HEC-HMS program computations.*

1.  Calculate the *TC* & *R* coefficients for each subbasin in the given
    watershed shown in Figure P5--1. Assume that the equations listed in
    Table 5--10 are ap- plicable and that *S* = *S*~0~.

**Figure P5--1**

2.  Create the basin model of the watershed in HEC-HMS using the data
    provided. Set up input data for the watershed using Clark's UH
    method (*TC* & *R*). Use Muskingum routing methods and assume that
    *K* = 0.60 hr and *x* = 0.5 in reaches 1, 2, and 3. Assume two
    subreaches in each reach and assume baseflow is zero.

3.  Using the data shown in Table 5--9, create two meteorologic models
    in HEC- HMS using the 24-hr hypothetical design storms for the
    100-yr frequency and the 10-yr frequency events. Place the peak
    center at 50% for both storms and use 20-min maximum intensity
    duration.

4.  Create a new basin model for HEC-HMS Problem 5.2 to reflect a
    detention pond near Junction 2. Assume that the pond can be modeled
    in such a way

> that only the runoff from subbasin 3 should be routed through it. The
> storage-- discharge relation is given as follows:

6.  Run the HEC-HMS model with Δ*t* = 20 min to reflect the existing

10. Rain gage data are given in Table P5--10(a) for three rain gages
    within the wa- tershed. Weight the gage data over the five subareas
    according to the weighting values given in Table P5--10(b) (see
    Example 1--3 in Chapter 1). Set up the me- teorological model for
    subareas 1 through 5 in the watershed to reference this storm's
    rainfall data. For example, subbasin 2 receives 1/3 of gage 100R
    rainfall and 2/3 of gage 200R rainfall. Enter the actual rain gage
    data and weights into HEC-HMS.

> **Scope of This Chapter**
>
> This chapter describes techniques commonly applied in urban hydrology,
> emphasizing techniques not already discussed earlier in the text and
> modify- ing conventional techniques specifically for the urban
> situation. Modifica- tions include unique loss estimates for
> calculation of rainfall excess, decreased lag times in unit hydrograph
> (UH) procedures, and emphasis on kinematic wave techniques for
> overland flow routing. The choice of input rainfall for construction
> of a design hyetograph is of special importance in urban hydrology
> because impervious urban surfaces rapidly convert the rain- fall to
> runoff, such that short-time increment variations in the rainfall
> hyeto- graph usually create similar variations in the runoff
> hydrograph. Sewer hydraulics and options for control of urban flooding
> are discussed.
>
> Several comprehensive computer models also are available for applica-
> tion in urban situations; the chapter culminates in a review of such
> models plus a case study involving the EPA Storm Water Management
> Model, SWMM5. A considerable volume of literature is available on
> urban hydrology, including

> **Introduction**
>
> Although the same physical principles hold as elsewhere in the
> hydrologic cycle, the hydrology of urban areas is dominated by two
> distinct character- istics: (1) the preponderance of impervious
> surfaces (e.g., pavement, roofs) and (2) the presence of man-made or
> hydraulically "improved" drainage systems (e.g., a sewer system).
> Thus, the response of an urban catchment to rainfall is much faster
> than that of a rural catchment of equivalent area, slope, and soils.
> In addition, the runoff volume from an urban catchment is larger
> because there is less pervious area available for infiltration. These
> well-documented characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6--1. While

> Drainage systems in urban areas may rely on natural channels, but most
> cities have a sewer network for removal of stormwater. If the system
> is exclu- sively for stormwater removal, it is called a **storm
> sewer**. If the same conduit also carries domestic sewage, it is
> called a **combined sewer**. A combined sewer usually has a regulator
> (hydraulic control structure such as a weir or orifice) at its
> downstream end that diverts the dry-weather flow (domestic and
> industrial sewage) into an **interceptor**, which carries it to a
> treatment plant (Fig. 6--2). During wet weather, when the hydraulic

> interceptor and the regulator are exceeded, the combined sewer
> overflow (CSO, a mixture of stormwater and sewage) is released
> directly to the receiv- ing water body, with the potential for
> pollution problems. When the storm- water and domestic sewage are
> carried in separate conduits, the drainage system is said to be
> **separated**, as opposed to combined. Most newer cities have separate
> systems, but many older cities (e.g., Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta,
> Chicago, San Francisco) retain their combined systems, especially in
> the northeastern and midwestern United States.
>
> Storm and combined sewers are installed to remove stormwater from the
> land surface, thus preventing flooding and permitting normal transpor-
> tation on highways and the like. As such, they are usually designed to
> han- dle a peak flow corresponding to a given return period (Chapter
> 3) according to local regulations (2--10 yr for suburban drainage and
> 10--50 yr for major highways are typical). It should always be
> remembered that a storm (or combined) sewer system is a **minor
> drainage system** for stormwa- ter. That is, if the capacity is
> exceeded, the runoff will then find an alterna- tive pathway along the
> surface, or **major drainage system**. If the surface system (streets,
> for instance) is not designed to accommodate it, then the surface flow
> may flow through structures, with disastrous consequences. In other
> words, the major drainage system should always be designed with
> consideration of the possibility of failure or exceedance of the minor
> system (see Chapter 9).
>
> **The Engineering Problem in Urban Hydrology**
>
> The engineering problem in urban hydrology usually consists of the
> need to control peak flows and maximum depths throughout the drainage
> system. If the hydraulic grade line is too high, sewers may
> **surcharge**; that is, the water level may rise above the crown (top)
> of the sewer conduit, leading occasion- ally to basement flooding or
> discharge to streets. New facilities must be designed to minimize such
> occurrences, and existing drainage systems must often be modified
> ("**retrofitted**") to correct for them. Exceeding the capac- ity of
> an existing system is a problem that often occurs in newly developed
> areas that are served by an old sewer system.
>
> The water quality of urban runoff may also be poor (Environmental
> Protection Agency, 1983; Huber, 1993; Novotny, 1995), and special
> measures may be required simply to improve the quality of the runoff
> prior to dis- charge into receiving waters. This is especially true
> for the discharge of com- bined sewer overflows (Water Pollution
> Control Federation, 1989; Water Environment Federation and American
> Society of Civil Engineers, 1998).
>
> Alternatives for control of urban runoff quantity are many; a
> represen- tative list is given in Table 6--1 and discussed later. In
> new developments, it may be possible to provide retention (e.g., by
> infiltration) and detention to reduce downstream effects, but this is
> seldom an economical alternative for remediation of older systems in
> dense urban settings. Attenuation of flood

>
> **Design Objectives**
>
> The engineering objective when dealing with urban hydrology is to
> provide for control of peak flows and maximum depths at all locations
> within the drainage system while simultaneously protecting the
> environment. In essence it is the same flood control problem dealt
> with in Chapter 4, but with the added considerations associated with
> urbanization. Secondary issues include minimization of increased
> runoff volumes as well as basement flood- ing, surcharging, and water
> quality control.
>
> The analytical problems that must be solved to address these objec-
> tives are the predictions of runoff peaks, volumes, and complete
> hydro- graphs anywhere in the drainage system. These problems are
> often separated into those involving the surface drainage system, for
> which rain- fall must be converted into an overland flow hydrograph
> (or inlet hydro- graph, for flow into the inlet to the sewer system),
> and those involving the channel or sewer system, which often may be
> handled through conventional flow routing techniques (Chapter 4).
> However, there is a tendency in urban hydrology to lump the two
> systems together and produce one aggregate
>
> hydrograph (or peak flow or runoff volume) at the system outlet, such
> as by a unit hydrograph.
>
> The distinction between the needs to predict peak flows, runoff vol-
> umes, and complete hydrographs is important, since the three
> objectives may require very different analytical methods. In general,
> predictions of peaks and volumes lend themselves to simplified
> techniques, while hydrographs require a more comprehensive analysis.
>
> Estimation of base flow in urban drainage systems also requires
> special consideration, since water may enter the channels both as
> infiltration (seep- age into a conduit or open channel from ground
> water) and as domestic sewage. The total of the two is often evaluated
> from monitoring at down- stream treatment plants or from special
> infiltration/inflow (I/I) studies (Environmental Protection Agency,
> 1977; Pitt et al., 1993).
>
> A further distinction will be made regarding the application of ana-
> lytical techniques---namely, the design of new systems vs. the
> alleviation of drainage problems in old ones. More options are usually
> available for the former, whereas existing systems may impose severe
> constraints on control options for the latter.
>
> **Rainfall--Runoff**
>
> Conversion of rainfall into runoff in urban areas is usually somewhat
> simpli- fied because of the relatively high imperviousness of such
> areas, although in residential and open-land districts the calculation
> of infiltration into pervious surfaces may still represent a critical
> factor in the analysis. Infiltration esti- mates are complicated by
> the fact that urban soils are inevitably disturbed, and estimates
> based on data for natural soils may be in error (Pitt et al., 1999,
> 2001). Once computed, however, rainfall excess may be converted into a
> runoff hydrograph using almost any of the methods used for natural
> catch- ments (Chapter 2).
>
> When hydrographs are to be computed, special effort is required to
> obtain adequate rainfall data. This is because urban areas respond
> quickly to rainfall transients, in contrast to natural catchments,
> which dampen out short- term fluctuations. Thus, rainfall data should
> be available at 5-min or shorter increments to predict the runoff
> hydrograph adequately. Since 5-min data are seldom available, 15-min
> data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the U.S.
> National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administra- tion (NOAA) are
> often the next best resource (Appendix E). A further con- sideration
> is the storm direction; as for natural catchments, the hydrograph can
> have a considerably higher peak if the storm moves down the catchment
> toward the outlet. This means that one rain gage is seldom sufficient;
> at least three, plus a wind measurement, may be necessary to describe
> the dynamics of moving storms (James and Scheckenberger, 1984). Radar
> provides an excellent means of tracking moving storms (Chapter 11).

> **Catchment Description**

> The urban catchment is characterized by its area, shape, slope, soils,
> land use, imperviousness, roughness, and storage. The area and
> imperviousness are the two most important parameters for a good
> prediction of hydro- graph volumes. Although it is a seemingly
> straightforward parameter, esti- mation of the percent imperviousness
> can be subtle. In particular, it is usually necessary to distinguish
> between **directly connected impervious areas** (DCIA) and those that
> are not. Directly connected, or hydraulically effective, impervious
> areas are those that drain directly into the drainage system, such as
> a street surface with curbs and gutters that directs the run- off into
> a storm sewer inlet. **Nondirectly connected impervious areas**
> include rooftops or driveways that drain onto pervious areas. Runoff
> from such areas does not enter the storm drainage system unless the
> pervious areas become saturated.
>
> Estimates of imperviousness can be made by measuring such areas on
> aerial photographs or by considering land use; typical values are
> shown in Table 6--2. More recent data compiled using a geographical
> information sys- tem (GIS) are presented by Field et al. (2000) and
> Lee and Heaney (2003). For large urban areas, imperviousness can be
> estimated on the basis of pop- ulation density (e.g., Stankowski,

> analysis in urban hydrol- ogy. There are two related definitions:

1.  The time of concentration is the travel time of a *wave* to move
    > from the hydraulically most distant point in the catchment to the
    > outlet.

2.  The time of concentration is the time to equilibrium of the
    > catchment under a steady rainfall excess (i.e., when the outflow
    > from the catch- ment equals the rainfall excess onto the
    > catchment).

> Note especially that *t~c~* is *not* the travel time taken by a parcel
> of water to move down the catchment, as is so often cited in texts.
> The catchment is in equilibrium when the time *t~c~* is reached
> because the outlet then "feels" the inflow from every portion of the

> **Rainfall Measurement**
>
> As mentioned earlier, a unique aspect of urban hydrology is the fast
> response of an urban catchment to the rainfall input. This means that
> high-frequency information in the rainfall signal is transformed into
> high-frequency pulses in the runoff hydrograph, since the highly
> impervious urban catchment does not significantly dampen such
> fluctuations. In most cases, a tipping-bucket rain gage will provide
> an adequate resolution of high frequencies, in contrast to weighing
> bucket gages, which are also commonly employed. Tipping- bucket gages
> (Chapter 1) are much easier to install in a network because the
> electrical pulses can be transmitted over a telephone or other
> communica- tion device or recorded on a data logger at the site. In
> most urban modeling work, it is necessary to have hyetographs with
> 5-min or better resolution, although this may be relaxed somewhat for
> larger basins.
>
> Unless the catchment is very small (such that a storm completely
> "covers" the basin spatially), the outfall hydrograph will also be
> sensitive to the storm direction (James and Shtifter, 1981). To
> simulate the effects of a moving (or kinematic) storm, it is necessary
> to have more than one rain gage so that the longitudinal movement (up
> or down the basin) can be defined. Movement of the storm *across* the
> flow direction does not affect the hydrograph as much as longitudinal
> movement. These effects can be seen in Figure 6--4.
>
> **Intensity--Duration--Frequency Curves: Use and Misuse**
>
> IDF curves summarize *conditional* probabilities (frequencies) of
> rainfall depths or average intensities. Specifically, IDF curves are
> graphical repre- sentations of the probability that a certain average
> rainfall intensity will occur, given a duration; their derivation is
> discussed by McPherson (1978). For example, IDF curves for Houston,
> TX, are shown in Figure 1--15 and for Tallahassee, Florida, are shown

> period of an average intensity of 3.6 in./hr for a duration of 40 min
> in Tallahassee is 5 yr. (As described in Chapter 3, the return period

> duration of 20 min once, on the aver- age, every 10 yr, Figure 6--5

> IDF curves---and the duration is *not* the duration of an actual
> rainstorm.
>
> A critical characteristic of IDF curves is that the intensities are
> indeed averages over the specified duration and *do not represent
> actual time histories of rainfall*. The contour for a given return
> period could rep- resent the smoothed results of several different

> rather, it is merely a 20-min period, say, within a longer storm of
> any duration, during which the aver- age intensity happened to be the
> specified value. In fact, given that the IDF curves are really
> smoothed contours, unless a data point falls on a contour, they are
> completely hypothetical! A detailed analysis of the method of
> constructing IDF curves and the perils of improper interpreta- tion is
> given by McPherson (1978).
>
> To reiterate, (1) IDF curves do *not* represent time histories of real
> storms---the intensities are *averages* over the indicated duration,
> (2) a single curve represents data from several different storms, (3)
> the duration is *not* the duration of an actual storm and most likely
> represents a shorter period within a longer storm, and (4) it is
> incorrect to use IDF curves to obtain a storm event volume because the
> duration must be arbitrarily assigned. The preponderance of IDF
> information in the hydrologic litera- ture is primarily a result of
> the need for IDF curves for use in the rational method (described in
> Section 6.4). As will be seen, the IDF data are prop- erly applied in
> this case.

> **Definition of a Storm Event**
>
> Return periods (or frequencies) can be assigned to rainfall events on
> the basis of several different parameters, but most commonly on the
> basis of total volume, average intensity, peak intensity, duration, or
> interevent time. To work with any of these parameters, the rainfall
> time series must first be separated into a series of discrete,
> independent events. When this is done, they may be ranked by volume or
> any desired parameter and a conventional frequency analysis performed
> (Chapter 3).
>
> For ease of computation, a statistical measure is usually employed to
> separate independent storm events. A minimum interevent time (MIT) is
> defined such that rainfall pulses separated by a time less than this
> value are considered part of the same event. The process can be
> illustrated by an example.

> When an MIT value of zero is used, all rainfall hours are considered
> to be separate events; hence the number of events is equal to the
> number of rainfall hours. For an MIT value of 1 hr, at least 1 dry
> hour is required to separate events, leading to the seven events
> (clusters of contiguous wet hours) given in the table. Since there are
> no rainfall hours separated by more than 6 hr, all rainfall is

> Several possibilities exist for a statistical measure with which to

> Having completed the event separation, the events may be ranked by the

> the seven highest total storm volumes for a 25-yr record of hourly
> rainfalls in Tallahassee, Florida, are shown in Table 6--4, for which
> the MIT is 5 hr. It is clear that these volumes can arise from actual
> storms of greatly differing durations, certainly not fixed as on an
> IDF curve. For comparison, 24-hr depths are also shown, taken from IDF
> data for the Tallahassee region (Wel- don, 1985). Notice that the
> 24-hr depths are in the correct range of return periods for total
> storm depths, but this would not be true if other durations were used.

> **Choice of Design Rainfall**
>
> Often in an urban analysis it is necessary to provide a design storm
> for a model with which to evaluate the effectiveness of a drainage
> system. Ideally these rainfall inputs consist of measured hyetographs
> obtained during a monitoring program of the catchment and are used for
> calibration and veri- fication of a model. In this case, there is
> little question about the choice of rainfall input, but more often
> than not an agency will require a design storm corresponding to a
> specified return period, such as a 25-yr storm. There are several ways
> to define such an event, and the method of constructing and applying a
> design storm can be very controversial (Adams and Howard, 1985;
> Harremšeös, 1983; McPherson, 1978; Patry and McPherson, 1979; Debo and
> Reese, 2003).
>
> The first question is, to what storm parameter does the return period
> apply? That is, is it a 25-yr storm based on runoff volume, peak flow,
> aver- age flow, or rainfall volume, rainfall average intensity, and so
> on? Equally important, given that antecedent conditions in the
> catchment can be highly variable and that the catchment will alter the
> nature of the rainfall input in any case, the return period of a storm
> based on rainfall characteristics will *not,* in general, be the same
> as the return period of the same storm based on runoff
> characteristics. For example, the 25-yr storm based on rainfall volume
> may be only the 5-yr storm based on runoff volume if the catchment is
> dry before the storm occurs. (This characteristic is illustrated in
> the SWMM5 example at the end of this chapter.) Thus, it is an error to
> assign a return period to a runoff characteristic based on a frequency
> anal- ysis of rainfall.
>
> **Synthetic Design Storms**
>
> The use of IDF curves (e.g., Fig. 6--5) is intimately linked to most
> of the methods for constructing **synthetic** (hypothetical) **design
> storms**. A typical synthetic design storm is constructed in the
> following manner (e.g., King County, 1995; Debo and Reese, 2003).
> First, a duration is specified, often arbitrarily by an agency, say 24
> hr. Second, the 24-hr depth is obtained from an IDF curve for the
> desired return period. Third, the rainfall must be dis- tributed in
> time to construct the synthetic hyetograph. There are major
> differences in the literature in this last step (Arnell, 1982). The
> shape varies, mainly depending on the type of storm to be simulated: A
> cyclonic storm usually has the highest intensities near the middle,
> and a convective storm usually has the highest intensities near the
> beginning. However, in the United States, temporal distributions
> published by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the
> SCS) are often used, such as the type II distribution in the Southeast
> and type 1A distribution in the Pacific Northwest.
>
> **EXAMPLE 6--4**
>
> **CONSTRUCTION OF SCS TYPE II, 24-HR DESIGN STORM**
>
> Construct a 5-yr, 24-hr design storm for Tallahassee, using the SCS
> type II distribution.
>
> **SOLUTION**
>
> The distribution (percentage mass curve) is tabulated in Table E6--4.
> The duration of the design storm must be 24 hr to use the SCS type II
> distribution, which is specifically given for a 24-hr duration. From
> the Tallahassee IDF curve shown in Figure 6--5, the average intensity
> for 24 hr and a 5-yr return period is 0.305 in./hr. This leads to a
> total depth for 24 hr of 7.32 in., as indicated in Table 6--4. The
> total depth is allocated over the hourly increments in Table E6--4,
> and the average intensities for each hour are plotted in Figure E6--4.
> Because the time interval used is 1 hr, average intensities are the
> same numerically as incremental depths, which are not shown. Notice
> the very high intensity during hour 12, re- flecting the fact that
> 42.5% (i.e., 66% --23.5%, from Table E6--4) of the total rainfall is
> assumed to occur during this interval.

> **Alternatives to Synthetic Design Storms**
>
> Synthetic design storms are very popular because they are relatively
> easy to construct and use. They require only IDF curves and an assumed
> shape for the hyetograph, not extensive historic rainfall data, and
> they may be consis- tently applied by oversight agencies. What are the
> alternatives? The best method is to analyze historical runoff data for
> the catchment to identify storms of interest based on a frequency
> analysis of peak flows, flood depths, runoff volumes, and so on. The
> storms that caused, say, the 5-yr peak flow could then be used for
> design purposes (given adequate information on ante- cedent
> conditions). This would involve several storms, with very different
> temporal distributions, each with a return period close to 5 yr, based
> on some criterion. The case study at the conclusion of this chapter
> illustrates a collec- tion of such storms, based on simulation
> results, not monitoring results.
>
> Selection of storms from a monitoring program is seldom possible in
> urban areas because flow-monitoring programs are typically short, and
> there may be extensive development underway in the catchment that
> alters the rainfall--runoff mechanisms, thus destroying the
> homogeneity of the runoff record. Probably the best alternative is to
> apply a continuous simulation model to simulate runoff hydrographs for
> a period of, say, 25 yr based on historic rainfall records available
> from the NCDC. When available, 15-min data are preferable to the more
> common 1-hr data. The model must first be calibrated using measured
> rainfall and runoff data. A frequency analysis can then be performed
> on the simulated hydrographs---on the parameters of interest---from
> which historical design storms can be identified for more detailed
> analysis (Huber et al., 1986). (The detailed analysis must also have a
> means for establishing the correct antecedent conditions, a problem
> auto- matically handled during the continuous simulation.) Both of
> these options (frequency analysis of measured or simulated
> hydrographs) have the advan- tage of an analysis of runoff, not of
> rainfall. This continuous simulation approach is routinely used by the
> USGS to develop its regional flood fre- quency data and is
> demonstrated in the case study at the end of this chapter.
>
> A third alternative is a frequency analysis on rainfall *events,*
> similar to that shown in Table 6--4. If historical events from such an
> analysis are sub- sequently used for design storms, the disadvantage
> remains of basing return periods on rainfall characteristics instead
> of on runoff characteristics, but at least there would not be an
> assumption of a duration. A frequency analysis of rainfall statistics
> can also be used in a **derived distribution** approach, in which the
> frequency distribution of runoff is derived from the frequency
> distribution of rainfall (Adams and Papa, 2000).
>
> To summarize, the use of historical storms for design purposes is pre-
> ferred because the frequency analysis can be directed to the specific
> param- eter of interest without an assumed duration and because there
> is no need to make an arbitrary assumption about the shape of the
> hyetograph. The use of historical storms also has an advantage when
> dealing with the public, because a design can be presented to prevent
> the flooding that occurred
>
> from a specific real event in the public's memory. The main
> disadvantage is simply the extra effort involved in a continuous
> simulation or a frequency analysis based on storm events rather than
> on conditional frequencies read- ily available from published IDF
> data. As a result, synthetic design storms are most often used in
> practice.
>
> A final word of caution is warranted regarding continuous simulation.
> Because there are seldom enough long-term rain gages to cover the
> urban area adequately, a single gage is often used to drive a
> continuous model, assuming that the entire catchment receives the
> point rainfall measured by the gage. This is an acceptable assumption
> for small catchments and/or spatially uniform (e.g., cyclonic)
> rainfall. However, for spatially variable (e.g., convective) rainfall,
> peaks may be overestimated by the model because the rainfall may not
> cover the entire basin. Long-term volumes are probably adequately
> reproduced, but peak flows identified from a fre- quency analysis
> using a modeling scheme of this sort should be reexamined on an event
> basis using a realistic spatial distribution of rainfall before being
> used for design purposes.
>
> **Peak Flow, Volume, or Hydrograph?**
>
> Recall that there are several possible parameters to be determined in
> an urban hydrologic analysis, but most often they include peak flow,
> runoff volume, or the complete runoff hydrograph. Related parameters
> might be the hydraulic grade line or flooding depths. If hydrographs
> are predicted, then peaks and volumes are an implicit part of the
> analysis, but some of the simpler methods, e.g., the rational method,
> will not necessarily provide all parameters of possible interest.
>
> **Peak Flows by the Rational Method**
>
> The rational method dates from the 1850s in Ireland (Dooge, 1973) and
> is called the Lloyd-Davies method in Great Britain. Published in the
> United States by Kuichling (1889), it is one of the simplest and
> best-known meth- ods routinely applied in urban hydrology; although it
> contains subtleties that are not always appreciated. Peak flows are
> predicted by the simple product
>

>
> **METHODS FOR QUANTITY ANALYSIS**
>
> where
>
> *Q~p~* = *k~c~CiA*, (6--8)
>
> *Q~p~* = peak flow (cfs or m^3^/s),
>
> *C* = runoff coefficient,
>
> *i* = rainfall intensity (in./hr or mm/hr),
>
> *A* = catchment area (ac or ha),
>
> *k~c~* = conversion factor.
>
> When U.S. customary units are used, the conversion factor *k~c~* =
> 1.008 to convert ac-in./hr to cfs and is routinely ignored; this
> simple conversion is the basis for the term *rational* in the rational
> method. (The approximate equivalence of ac-in./hr to cfs is worth
> remembering for convenient rough calculations.) For the alternative
> metric units given with Equation (6--8), the conversion factor *k~c~*
> = 0.00278 to convert ha-mm/hr to m^3^/s.
>
> Because of the assumptions regarding the homogeneity of rainfall and
> equilibrium conditions at the time of peak flow, the rational method
> should not be used on areas larger than several hundred acres (a few
> hundred hect- ares) without subdividing the overall catchment into
> subcatchments and including the effect of routing through drainage
> channels (Water Environment Federation and American Society of Civil
> Engineers, 1992). Since actual rain- fall is not homogeneous in space
> and time, the rational method becomes more conservative (i.e., it
> overpredicts peak flows) as the area becomes larger.
>
> All catchment losses are incorporated into the runoff coefficient *C*,
> which is usually given as a function of land use (Table 6--5). The
> runoff coef- ficient is higher for higher return period (more severe)
> storms because infil- tration and depression storage are relatively
> less important; values in Table 6--5 are typical for return periods of
> 2 to 10 yrs. A study for the Denver Urban Drainage and Flood Control
> District (Wright-McLaughlin Engineers, 1984) documented the effect
> qualitatively but not quantitatively. That is, runoff coefficients may
> be increased beyond the upper bounds in Table 6--5 for *T* 7 10 yr,
> but by what factor is not known. Runoff coefficients for a variety of

> **Coefficient and Regression Methods**
>
> Regression techniques are often incorporated into other methods such
> as synthetic unit hydrographs (Chapter 2), in which parameters of the
> hydro- graph are related to physical parameters of the urban
> catchment. Peak flows may also be found by regression analysis (e.g.,
> Bensen, 1962), but this appli- cation is usually performed only for
> large nonurban catchments. The USGS also uses regional regression
> techniques to relate frequency-analysis results to catchment
> characteristics (Sections 3.7). However, the most straightfor- ward
> application is to determine a relationship between measured values of
> desired independent and dependent variables, such as rainfall and
> runoff.
>
> When measured rainfall and runoff data are available, it is common to
> regress the runoff against the rainfall. If a linear equation is fit
> to the data, it will have the form
>
> *R* = *CR*(*P* - *DS*), (6--11)
>
> where
>
> *R* = runoff depth,
>
> *P* = rainfall depth,
>
> *CR* = slope of the fitted line (approximate runoff coefficient),
>
> *DS* = depression storage (depth).
>
> Here depths, not flows, are predicted. Since the depths are equivalent
> to volumes (when multiplied by the catchment area), depth and volume
> are often used interchangeably. The form of Equation (6--11) assumes
> that there will be no runoff until the depression storage is filled by
> rainfall. (If *DS* is negative, the equation can be rewritten to
> indicate a positive intercept on the runoff axis. This situation
> implies a base flow---that is, a contribution to runoff even with zero
> rainfall.) The slope *CR* is almost equivalent to a runoff coefficient
> \[Eq. (6--9)\], except that part of the losses is incorporated into
> the depression storage. Equation (6--11) works best for monthly or
> annual totals rather than for individual storm events and is not
> suited for situations in which there is appreciable carryover in the
> catchment storage (Diskin, 1970).

> **Regression---Flood Frequency Methods**
>
> The USGS extrapolates urban flood frequencies by regression analysis.
> Peak flow prediction by this method has been performed for urban areas
> for the United States as a whole (Sauer et al., 1983) and for many
> individual cities. For example, flood volumes and flood peaks have
> been analyzed for Talla- hassee by Franklin (1984) and Franklin and
> Losey (1984), respectively, and by Laenen (1983) for Oregon's
> Willamette Valley. The procedure is one way of performing a *regional
> analysis* and is described in Section 3.7, and exam- ple regression
> equations for Tallahassee are given in Table 3--9.
>
> **Unit Hydrographs**
>
> Unit hydrographs, introduced in Chapter 2, have also been applied in
> urban areas, with the parameters of the UH related to catchment
> parameters by regression analysis. This was first performed by
> Eagleson (1962) and later by several researchers, including Brater and
> Sherrill (1975) and Espey et al. (1977). Applications of UHs were
> presented in Chapter 2 and are an option in the HEC-HMS model (Chapter
> 5).
>
> **Time--Area Methods**
>
> Time--area methods have also been applied with success in urban areas
> because of the relative ease of estimation of losses. The origin of
> the time-- area curve was discussed in Chapter 1, but it should be
> emphasized that, strictly speaking, the isochrones of equal travel
> time shown in Figure 1--23 should be travel times of *waves,* not
> parcels of water, to reach the outlet, since the principle involved is
> one of time to equilibrium from each contrib- uting area---i.e., the
> same principle discussed earlier in the context of the kinematic wave.
> This concept is often ignored in applications of time--area methods,
> but a relatively easy correction to water parcel travel times can be
> made using Equation (6--2), in which water velocities are multiplied
> by the appropriate kinematic wave exponent to approximate wave
> velocities. Two urban models that employ time--area methods are the
> Road Research Lab- oratory (RRL) model (Stall and Terstriep, 1972;
> Watkins, 1962) and the ILLUDAS model (Terstriep and Stall, 1974). The
> time--area method is dem- onstrated in Problems 6.14 and 6.15.
>
> If the time--area diagram is approximated by an isosceles triangle,
> with base *t~c~*, and outflows are then routed through a linear
> reservoir; the tech- nique is sometimes called the O'Kelly model
> (O'Kelly, 1955; Dooge, 1973). The linear reservoir is intended to
> provide attenuation not represented by the translation effect of the
> time--area diagram. The Santa Barbara method (Stubchaer, 1975;
> Wanielista, 1990) consists of routing rainfall excess, weighted from
> impervious and pervious areas, through a linear reservoir with time
> constant equal to the time of concentration. The Santa Barbara method
> is illustrated in Problem 6.22.
>
> **Kinematic Wave Methods**
>
> The kinematic wave equations have been discussed earlier in this
> chapter as well as in Chapter 4. The numerical techniques shown in
> Chapter 4 are usu- ally necessary for urban areas with unsteady and
> nonuniform rainfall excess. However, the analytical solution for the
> case of steady, uniform rainfall excess (Eagleson, 1970) highlights
> the concept of wave travel times \[Eqs. (6--2) and (6--7)\] and the
> time of concentration \[Eq. (6--6)\], both immensely useful in urban
> hydrology. An example of a watershed model that uses kine- matic waves
> (HEC-HMS) was discussed in Chapter 5. The SWMM model (Huber and
> Dickinson, 1988; Rossman, 2005) optionally uses the kinematic wave for
> the channel routing component (see Section 4.6). A distributed model
> for overland flow based on the kinematic wave applied to a grid sys-
> tem is presented in Chapter 11.
>
> **Linear and Nonlinear Reservoirs**
>
> A catchment surface may be conceptualized as a "reservoir" with
> inflows due to rainfall (and possible upstream contributions) and
> outflows due to evaporation, infiltration, and surface runoff (Fig.
> 6--7(a)). This has led to sev- eral methods for conversion of rainfall
> into runoff, based on solutions to the reservoir routing equations
> (Dooge, 1973). For use of reservoir methods, surface storage is
> spatially lumped; that is, there is no variation with hori- zontal
> distance, and the storage is conceptualized as a "tank" with inflows
> and outflows. Spatial variations may be incorporated by distributing
> these lumped storages over the catchment to reflect parameter
> variations and so on (Fig. 6--7(b)). The distributed storages are then
> linked by channel routing routines. The equations for reservoir
> routing can be solved both for conver- sion of rainfall into runoff
> and for application to "real" reservoirs, such as detention basins.
> The latter will be described in Section 6.6.

> encountered in sewer systems; in particular, both the explicit and
> implicit methods are more easily adapted to surcharge conditions.

> **Surcharging**
>
> Surcharging occurs when the hydraulic grade line (HGL) of the flow is
> above the sewer crown, as in the downstream segment sketched in Figure
> 6--8. If the HGL rises above the level of basement drains connected to
> the sewer system, water will be backed into basements and will cause
> basement flood- ing. Health problems may also result if combined
> sewage enters basements, as sometimes occurs in older cities. The most
> spectacular effects of surcharg- ing are blown manhole covers and
> geysers out of the sewer system when the HGL rises well above the
> ground surface. If the HGL remains below the ground surface and below
> the level of basement drains, usually no special problem is associated
> with surcharging, and the flow may even be acceler- ated by
> pressurizing the conduit.
>
> Since surcharged conduits are really just a network flowing under
> pres- surized conditions, one way of simulating the surcharge
> conditions is to treat the network like a water distribution network,
> in which an iterative solution is used for heads (HGL) at nodes while
> maintaining continuity and friction losses. This method has been
> applied on a steady-state basis by Wood and Heitzman (1983) and as
> part of the more general SWMM5 Dynamic Routing procedure (Roesner et
> al., 1988; Rossman, 2006). Another option is to use the Preissmann
> slot method, in which a small "imaginary" slot above the sewer allows
> free-surface flow to be maintained at all times and permits the use of
> only the Saint Venant equations. Models that use this scheme include
> Carredas (SOGREAH, 1977) and S11S (Hoff-Clausen et al., 1981).
>
> The transition from free-surface flow to a surcharged condition is not
> necessarily smooth and may be accompanied by the release of trapped
> air, hydraulic jumps, and pressure waves (McCorquodale and Hamam,
> 1983; Song et al., 1983). No general sewer routing model deals with
> this problem; special hydraulic model studies or numerical techniques
> are needed and must be used if it is important.
>
> **Routing at Internal Hydraulic Structures**
>
> Structures that may be found in a storm or combined sewer include
> weirs, orifices, pump stations, tide gates, storage tanks, and
> diversion structures or regulators of various kinds that may or may
> not behave as a conven- tional weir or orifice. To the extent that
> they do, Equation (6--16) may be used to represent an orifice and
> Equation (6--15) a weir. Special allowance must be made for submerged
> weirs and weirs of other geometries (see Fig. 9--17 or Davis, 1952;
> Chow, 1959; King and Brater, 1963; French, 1985; Mays, 2001b).
>
> **Side-flow weirs** are often encountered in sewer systems. An exact
> analysis requires analysis of the gradually varied flow past the weir
> (Chow, 1959; Henderson, 1966; Metcalf and Eddy, 1972; Hager, 1987;
> Debo and Reese, 2003). Early experimental work by Engels (1921)
> resulted in the following equation for total discharge over a
> side-flow weir in a rectangu- lar channel, for which the water surface
> profile rises along the length of the weir:

where

> *Q* = 3.32*L*^0.83^*h*^1.67^, (6--21)
>
> *Q* = side-flow weir discharge, cfs,
>
> *L* = weir length (in direction of main channel flow), ft,
>
> *h* = head on lower (downstream) end of weir, ft.
>
> For a more rigorous solution, the flow per unit length along the
> side-flow weir is
>
> *q* = *C~s~h*^3\>2^, (6--22)

> where

> *q* = discharge per unit length over the side weir (cfs/ft or m^2^/s),
>
> *h* = *h*(*x*) = head along the weir crest (ft or m),
>
> *C~s~* = weir coefficient (ft^1/2^/s or m^1/2^/s).
>
> The head will vary along the length of the weir, and a numerical
> solution for the head and discharge is required (Henderson, 1966;
> Metcalf and Eddy, 1972; Debo and Reese, 2003). The coefficient *C~s~*
> is a function of the geom- etry of the weir installation and of the
> upstream Froude number. As an approximation, a constant value of 4.1
> for U.S. customary units and 2.26 for metric units may be used
> (Ackers, 1957). The full functional relationship for *C~s~* is
> presented by Hager (1987).
>
> Similarly, a gradually varied flow analysis may be used for the exact
> analysis of flow over an open **grate inlet** on the street surface.
> Resource material for the hydraulics of flow over grate inlets on the
> surface of the ground is provided by Ring (1983), U.S. Department of
> Transportation (1984), Water Environment Federation and American
> Society of Civil Engi- neers (1992), Mays (2001b), and Debo and Reese
> (2003).
>
> **Tide gates**, usually in the form of **flap gates**, are often
> installed at the outlet of a sewer system to prevent backflow of the
> receiving water into the sewer conduits; they open only when the head
> inside the conduits is higher than the head in the receiving water. As
> such, they are often treated as an orifice, with discharge
> coefficients available from the manufacturer.
>
> **Pumps** are usually operated in at least two stages. The first stage
> is turned on when the water in the wet well rises to a certain level,
> and the second stage and any additional stages are started when and if
> the water rises to higher specified levels. The pumps may simply raise
> the water to a higher level for continued free-surface flow, or they
> may discharge through a **force main** (a pressurized conduit).
> Outflow for either situation will consist of pulses as the pumps
> alternately turn on and off. Records of pumping cycles sometimes serve
> as a means for approximate flow measurements, but the actual discharge
> depends on the head-vs.-discharge rating curve for the pumps.

> Weirs and other structures often create storage in the system. Routing
> through such storage can be accomplished by conventional means
> (Chapter 4), as described next.
>
> Several options for control of urban runoff quantity were listed in
> Table 6--1, of which storage in one form or another is dominant.

> **CONTROL OPTIONS**
>
> **Detention/Retention**
>
> **Detention storage**, also known as **extended detention storage**,
> involves detaining or slowing runoff, as in a reservoir, and then
> releasing it, typically over a period of from 24 to 72 hours. In
> **retention storage**, runoff is not released downstream and is
> usually removed from storage only by infiltra- tion through a porous
> bottom or by evaporation. Both types of storage are very common,
> although designed retention becomes less practical as the size of the
> drainage area increases. The required retention basin volume should be
> based on an analysis of storm event volumes, as discussed in Section
> 6.3.

> **DETENTION BASIN SIZING**
>
> Obtain an estimate for the size of a detention basin required to hold
> the runoff from a 5-yr (volume) storm for the 2230-ac Megginnis Arm
> catch- ment in Tallahassee, Florida.
>
> **SOLUTION**
>
> The regression relationship developed in Example 6--8 can be used as a
> very rough method for converting rainfall into runoff. The 5-yr storm
> event rainfall depth is approximately 8.18 in., from Table 6--4. Thus,
>
> runoff = 0.308(8.18 - 0.059) = 2.50 in. = 0.21 ft.
>
> The required volume is the depth times the catchment area: volume =
> 0.21 ft \* 2230 ac \* 43560 ft^3^/ac = 2.04 \* 10^7^ ft^3^.
>
> If the 5-yr, 24-hr depths of 7.32 in. from the Tallahassee IDF curves
> were used, a similar calculation would yield a runoff depth of 2.24
> in. (0.186 ft) and a volume of 1.81 \* 10^7^ ft^3^. This value is
> slightly less than that obtained from the frequency analysis of storm
> event depths.
>
> Note that this crude regression analysis ignores important factors of
> antecedent conditions, variable loss coefficients, and spatial and
> tem- poral rainfall variations that can be included in the analysis
> when using continuous simulation in rainfall--runoff models. The use
> of such output for detention basin sizing is demonstrated in the SWMM5
> case study at the end of this chapter. Methods based on design storms
> are discussed by Urbonas and Stahre (1993).
>
> Extended detention basins (also called retarding basins, or storm-
> water management basins) usually serve the multiple purposes of flood
> control and water quality control. The outlets are designed to hold a

> In-system storage can be installed in areas where cheaper surface
> stor- age is unavailable. Such storage can consist of concrete tanks

> itself, sometimes by means of adjustable weirs that are used to detain

>
> Surface storage may also be available on rooftops, in parking lots,
> and on other private lands. For example, if a roof is structurally
> suited, water may be ponded up to a few inches by using special drain
> fixtures. Rooftop vegetation for this purpose may also be
> employed---an example of "green engineering" (Field et al., 2000;
> Prince George's County, 2000; Field and Sullivan, 2003; Field et al.,

> leaks and main- tenance, and storage on private lands often is
> unsuccessful for this reason. (In general, maintenance of BMPs is a
> huge practical issue.) When storage does exist on private lands or
> adjacent to highways, an allowance for this "loss" must be made in the
> depression storage value used for the catchment.
>
> **Increased Infiltration**
>
> Since urbanization creates increased imperviousness, one likely
> control is to increase the amount of pervious area wherever possible.
> This has been accomplished with porous parking lots through the use of
> concrete block or similar shapes laid such that water can infiltrate
> through the soil-filled center. The blocks lend strength to the soil,
> and grass may grow on the soil so that the blocks are not visible.
> Monolithic permeable pavement is con- structed by leaving out most of
> the fine fraction of aggregate of the pave- ment mix, and placed like
> regular pavement (Urbonas and Stahre, 1993), and most difficulties of
> possible clogging have been overcome. Interlocking porous pavement
> does not generally have the clogging issue, depending on the paver
> hole size (Field et al., 2000). Although increased infiltration is
> very useful for small storms and for water quality control (of small
> storms), it is not of much use for larger storms, for which the soil
> may become saturated. On the other hand, vegetated areas that
> facilitate infiltration also facilitate evapotranspiration (ET).
> Increased ET is a good way to reduce stormwater runoff volumes from
> more frequent small storm events, especially when BMPs for this
> purpose are distributed around the catch- ment, in the manner of
> low-impact development (LID). Design guidelines for several types of
> LID facilities are provided by Low Impact Develop- ment Center et al.
> (2006).
>
> **Other Methods**
>
> Inlet restrictions are sometimes used in older cities that suffer from
> sur- charged sewer lines and for which storage is not an option. Such
> devices (Water Pollution Control Federation, 1989; Field et al., 2004)
> limit the rate at which surface runoff can enter the sewer system,
> thus trading off a reduc- tion in the hydraulic grade line in the
> sewer for increased street surface flooding. However, the latter is
> usually only temporary, and this measure does reduce basement
> flooding. Hence inlet restrictions may be the least expensive
> alternative in older combined sewer systems.
>
> Nonstructural alternatives include **floodplain zoning** and
> **floodproofing** of individual structures, as for general floodplain
> management (James and Lee, 1971; Mays, 2001a). Floodplain zoning
> restricts land use in flood-prone areas (often designated as the 10-yr
> or 100-yr floodplain) to compatible uses, such as parks, agriculture,
> and so on. Although some damages may still occur during flooding,
> major damage to the urban infrastructure is usually avoided.
>
> Floodproofing involves raising the foundation of structures above a
> designated flood elevation, using either fill or pilings, or "stilts."
> The methods may be used in combination, with zoning near the channel
> and floodproofing farther away (James and Lee, 1971). These two
> nonstructural alternatives are often not feasible in older cities
> because of the impossibility of relocating existing structures. Many
> additional nonstructural alternatives exist for management of
> stormwater quality (Field et al., 2006). These topics are covered in
> more detail in Chapter 12.
