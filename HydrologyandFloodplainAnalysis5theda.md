PREFACE

> The field of hydrology is of fundamental importance to civil and
> environ- mental engineers, hydrogeologists, and other earth scientists
> because of the environmental significance of water supply, major
> floods and droughts and their management, drainage and urban
> stormwater issues, floodplain man- agement, and water quality impacts.
> In recent years, hurricanes and storm surge have caused significant
> urban disasters, especially along coastal areas where urban
> development has expanded rapidly. This text was written to address the
> computational emphasis of modern hydrology at an undergrad- uate or
> graduate level, and to provide a balanced approach to important
> applications in hydrologic engineering and science.
>
> Increasing use and sophistication of personal computers has
> revolutionized the daily practice of hydrology. The Internet has
> revolutionized the accessibil- ity of hydrologic data and computer
> models. The impact of transferring online data from governmental and
> scientific sources to the practicing hydrologist or student has been
> phenomenal. Hydrologic data, digital terrain models, and mapping
> software linked with hydrologic modeling have allowed complex problems
> to be solved. Geographical information systems (GIS) and radar
> rainfall have greatly improved our ability to predict hydrologic
> response using distributed information. A number of major improvements
> have been made to existing hydrologic models, such as HEC and SWMM,
> and advances in distributed hydrologic modeling such as Vflo. A list
> of important websites and links currently used routinely in hydrology
> is contained in Appendix E and can be found at the textbook website:

> **THE EVOLUTION OF HYDROLOGY**

-   **Chapter 1:** Extensive updates and changes, and completely rewrit-
    ten with a more introductory coverage of topics, including simple
    rainfall runoff and hydrograph analysis with new examples and
    completely revised homework problems.

-   **Chapter 2:** Coverage of the unit hydrograph and includes hydro-
    logic losses such as evaporation and infiltration. New examples have
    been added on Green and Ampt infiltration, as well as many
    additional homework problems.

-   **Chapter 4:** Expanded coverage and new examples on flood routing.
    Many of the older numerical schemes have been simplified or removed,
    and new homework problems have been added to stream- line the
    chapter.

-   **Chapter 5:** Presents updated methods for simulating rainfall and
    runoff, flood hydrograph prediction, and flood control options in a

> watershed. New models are highlighted with new examples and a new
> detailed case study, including flood control alternatives. All new
> homework problems have been written as well.

-   **Chapter 10:** Describes the application of GIS and geospatial
    > infor- mation in hydrologic analysis and formulation of hydrologic
    > models. An updated list of available GIS and related software is
    > provided.

-   **Chapter 11:** Major advances in detecting accurate and representa-
    > tive rainfall with radar and rain gages are presented. The
    > applica- tion of radar rainfall as distributed model input is
    > described. Details on distributed hydrologic modeling are
    > presented for a case study, for which sample datasets are
    > available in Appendix E.

-   **Chapter 12:** Reviews the new emerging trends in flood control
    > methods and floodplain management, a vital topic given the recent
    > storm events in the United States, such as Hurricane Irene in the
    > northeast. A detailed discussion of massive hurricane impacts
    > along the Gulf Coast, including Hurricane Katrina and Ike, two of
    > the most damaging hurricanes in history.

-   **Chapter 13:** Brand new and includes emphasis on the San Antonio
    > River and Edwards Aquifer System in Central Texas, the Colorado
    > River Basin system, and the Thames River in England. The chapter
    > also briefly highlights international water issues in China and
    > South- east Asia. The chapter ends with a discussion of the
    > changing global condition and the need for sustainable interaction
    > between human and natural systems.

> **ORGANIZATION OF THE 5TH EDITION**
>
> The 5th edition of the text is divided into three main sections. The
> first sec- tion, consisting of the first four chapters, covers
> traditional topics in hydrol- ogy related to the water balance such
> as: (1) hydrologic principles, hydrologic cycle, and measurement
> techniques, (2) hydrologic analysis using hydrographs for
> rainfall-runoff, (3) statistical and flood frequency analysis, and (4)
> hydrologic and hydraulic flood routing methods. The sec- ond major
> section, Chapters 5 through 9, is designed to apply hydrologic theory
> and available hydrologic modeling techniques to several areas of
> engineering hydrology and design: watershed analysis, floodplain
> delinea- tion, ground water, and urban stormwater. The latest methods
> and com- puter models are emphasized in enough detail for practical
> use, and updated examples and new case studies are provided.
>
> Chapter 5 on Hydrologic Simulation Models has been completely redone
> and updated to include the latest model versions as highlighted below
> in the next section. Chapter 6, Urban Hydrology, presents methods and
> reviews available computer models for pipe and open channel storm
> drainage systems. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) is
> highlighted as the most comprehensive urban runoff model available
> today. Chapter 7, Floodplain Hydraulics, first reviews concepts from
> open channel flow and includes uni- form flow and critical flow
> coverage, as required to understand water surface
>
> profile computations. The HEC-RAS model is described in detail with a
> case study demonstrating the power of the model to evaluate natural
> floodplains. Chapter 8 presents ground water hydrology as a
> stand-alone chapter, including flow in porous media, aquifer
> properties, well mechanics, and computer appli- cations. Governing
> equations of flow are derived and applied to a number of ground water
> problems, including both steady-state and transient analyses. Chapter
> 9, written by James Thompson, is a comprehensive chapter on design
> applications in hydrology. It addresses design rainfall, small
> watershed design, hydraulic design, detention pond design, detailed
> culvert design, and flood- plain mitigation design issues. It is one
> of the most comprehensive design chap- ters ever written and presents
> both the theory and method behind modern hydrologic and hydraulic
> design techniques.
>
> In the final section of the 5th edition, three chapters (10, 11, 12)
> guide the user to the next generation of hydrologic computation,
> watershed eval- uation, and discussion of important severe storm
> impacts and flood man- agement. No other textbook presents this type
> of material all in one place. Chapter 13, a new chapter for the 5th
> edition, presents details of major water resource projects around the
> world.
>
> Chapter 10 presents the use of geographic information systems (GIS)
> and digital elevation models (DEMs) as important tools for watershed
> analysis, hydrologic modeling, and modern floodplain delineation. Many
> useful hydrologic datasets and software are now widely available in
> high- resolution digital form on the web (see Appendix E). Chapter 11
> depicts some of the latest technology on the use of NEXRAD radar data
> to esti- mate rainfall intensities over watershed areas. Radar
> rainfall has greatly improved our ability to predict rainfall patterns
> over a watershed and offers real advantages for hydrologic flood alert
> systems. Distributed hydrologic modeling is introduced that
> capitalizes on advances in radar rainfall detection.

The 5th edition of the text should provide the engineering or science
stu- dent with all the necessary theory to understand principles of
hydrology, hydrologic modeling, floodplain hydraulics and analysis, and
water resources in the modern digital world. The student or practicing
engineer should find the book a useful reference for hydrologic methods,
current models, design examples, and extensively documented case
studies. In addition, simple calculations and spreadsheet examples are
utilized and highlighted in numerous places in the 5th edition, which
contains over 80 worked examples, over 220 homework problems, and 6
major case studies.

> The World Wide Web offers many opportunities for access to regional
> data with minimal cost and effort (see Appendix E), but the U.S.
> Geological Survey, National Weather Service, National Resources
> Conservation Service,
>
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other state and local agencies
> should be emphasized for students as likely sources of regional
> hydrologic data.
>
> The text includes a Companion website *hydrology.rice.edu* where
> updates and information can be found regarding the 5th edition. Dr.
> Bedi- ent maintains the site that contains selected problems, example
> datasets,
>
> **AUDIENCE AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES**
>
> simple Excel programs, and dozens of PowerPoint presentations that are
> available to any instructors and students in the course at no charge.
> These resources are designed to improve the teaching of a hydrology
> course at either the undergraduate or graduate level. A detailed
> solutions manual with updated problems is available for the 5th
> edition. The solutions man- ual for the International Edition can be

> **INTRODUCTION TO HYDROLOGY**

**15**

> The **hydrologic cycle** is a continuous process in which water is
> evapo- rated from water surfaces and the oceans, moves inland as moist
> air masses, and produces precipitation if the correct vertical lifting
> conditions exist. The precipitation that falls from clouds onto the
> land surface of the earth is dis- persed to the hydrologic cycle via
> several pathways (Fig. 1--1). A portion of the **precipitation** *P*,
> or rainfall, is retained on the soil near where it falls and returns
> to the atmosphere via **evaporation** *E*, the conversion of water to
> water vapor from a water surface, and **transpiration** *T*, the loss
> of water vapor through plant tissue and leaves. The combined loss,
> called **evapotrans- piration** *ET*, is a maximum value if the water
> supply in the soil is adequate at all times. These parameters are
> further discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter and Section
> 2.6.
>
> Some water enters the soil system as **infiltration** *F*, which is a
> function of soil moisture conditions and soil type, and may reenter
> channels later as interflow or may percolate to recharge the shallow
> ground water. **Ground water** *G* flows in porous media in the
> subsurface in either shallow or deeper aquifer systems that can be
> pumped for water supply to agricultural and municipal water systems
> (see Chapter 8).
>
> The remaining portion of precipitation becomes overland flow or
> **direct runoff** *R*, which flows generally in a down-gradient
> direction to accu- mulate in local streams that then flow to rivers.
> Hydrologic analysis to deter- mine runoff response from a watershed
> area is covered in Chapter 2. Evaporation and infiltration are both
> complex losses from input rainfall and are difficult to measure or
> compute from theoretical methods, covered in detail in Sections 2.6,
> 2.7, and 2.8.

> Surface and ground waters flow from higher elevations toward lower
> elevations and may eventually discharge into the ocean, especially
> after large rainfall events (Fig. 1--1a). However, large quantities of
> surface water and portions of ground water return to the atmosphere by
> evaporation or *ET*, thus completing the natural hydrologic cycle
> (Fig. 1--1b). Precipitation from the atmosphere is a major force that
> drives the hydrologic cycle, and under- standing major weather

> **Ancient History**
>
> Biswas (1972), in a concise treatment of the history of hydrology,
> describes the early water management practices of the Sumerians and
> Egyptians in the Middle East and the Chinese along the banks of the
> Huang He (Yellow River). Archeological evidence exists for hydraulic
> structures that were built for irrigation and other water control
> activities. A dam was built across the Nile about 4000
> [b]{.smallcaps}.c., and later a canal for fresh water was constructed
> between Cairo and Suez.
>
> The Greek philosophers were the first serious students of hydrology,
> with Aristotle proposing the conversion of moist air into water deep
> inside mountains as the source of springs and streams. Homer suggested
> the idea

> of an underground sea as the source of all surface waters. The Romans
> con- structed numerous aqueducts to serve large cities as well as
> small towns and industrial sites. The Romans had the largest
> collection with water being sup- plied by 11 aqueducts constructed
> over a period of about 500 years. Figure 1--2 shows one of the famous
> aqueducts built in France during that early period. They served
> potable water and supplied the numerous baths and fountains in the
> city, as well as finally being emptied into the sewers, where the
> once-used gray water performed their last function in removing wastes.
> The construction of the Roman aqueducts is considered one of the most
> important engineering feats in history.
>
> Streamflow measurement techniques were first attempted in the water
> systems of Rome (a.d. 97) based on the cross-sectional area of flow.
> It remained for Leonardo da Vinci to discover the proper relationship
> between area, velocity, and flow rate during the Italian Renaissance.
> The first recorded measurement of rainfall and surface flow was made
> in the seven- teenth century by Perrault. He compared measured
> rainfall to the estimated flow of the Seine River to show the two were
> related. Perrault's findings were published in 1694. Halley, the
> English astronomer (1656--1742), used a small pan to estimate
> evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea and con- cluded that it was
> enough to account for tributary flows. Mariotte gaged the velocity of
> flow in the Seine River in Paris. These early beginnings of the
> science of hydrology provided the foundation for numerous advances in
> the eighteenth century, including Bernoulli's theorem, the Pitot tube
> for measur- ing velocity, and the Chezy (1769) formula, which form the
> basis for modern hydraulics and fluid measurement.
>
> During the nineteenth century, significant advances in ground water
> hydrology and hydraulics occurred. Darcy's law for flow in porous
> media was a major advance, as well as the Dupuit--Thiem well flow
> formula (Chapter 8). In addition, the Hagen--Poiseuille capillary flow
> equation was developed to describe flow in small channels. The
> Darcy-Weisbach equa- tion for pipe flow was also developed during this
> same period in the 1850s. In surface water hydrology, many flow
> formulas and measuring instruments
>
> were developed that allowed for the beginning of systematic stream
> gaging. In 1867, discharge measurements were organized on the Rhine
> River at Basel and quickly expanded throughout Europe.
>
> The U.S. Geological Survey set up the first systematic program of flow
> measurement in the United States on the Mississippi in 1888. During
> this same period, the United States founded a number of hydrologic
> agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1802), the U.S.
> Geological Survey (USGS, 1879), the Weather Bureau (1891), and the
> Mississippi River Commission (1893). The Price current meter was
> invented in 1885, and Man- ning's formula was introduced in 1889
> (Manning, 1889). The Weather Bureau is now called the National Weather
> Service (NWS) and is one of six organizations underneath the National
> Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration (NOAA). NOAA is the agency
> responsible for weather data collec- tion and severe-storm, river, and
> hurricane forecasting for the United States, and many of its websites
> are listed throughout the textbook. The USGS gag- ing network for
> rainfall, streamflow, and water quality is one of the most extensive
> in the world.
>
> **Early History (1930s--1950s)**
>
> The period from 1930 to 1950, which Chow (1964) called the Period of
> Ratio- nalization, produced a significant step forward for the field
> of hydrology, as government agencies began to develop their own
> programs of hydrologic research. Sherman's unit hydrograph (1932) (see
> Chapter 2), Horton's infil- tration theory (1933), and Theis's
> nonequilibrium equation (1935) in well hydraulics (Chapter 8) advanced
> the state of hydrology in very significant ways. Gumbel (1958)
> proposed the use of extreme-value distributions for frequency analysis
> of hydrologic data, thus forming the basis for modern statistical
> hydrology (Chapter 3). In this period, the U.S. Army Corps of
> Engineers (ACOE), the NWS within NOAA, the U.S. Department of Agri-
> culture (USDA), and the USGS made significant contributions in
> hydrologic theory and the development of a national network of gages
> for precipitation, evaporation, and streamflow measurements. The NWS
> is still largely respon- sible for rainfall measurements, reporting
> and forecasting of severe storms, and other related hydrologic
> investigations.
>
> The U.S. ACOE and the USDA Soil Conservation Service (now called the
> Natural Resources Conservation Service \[NRCS\]) made significant con-
> tributions to the field of hydrology in relation to flood control,
> reservoir development, irrigation, and soil conservation during this
> period. More recently, the USGS has taken significant strides to set
> up a national network of stream gages and rainfall gages for both
> quantity and quality data. Their water supply publications and special
> investigations have done much to advance the field of hydrology by
> presenting the analysis of complex hydro- logic data to develop
> relationships and explain hydrologic processes. The NWS and USGS both
> support numerous websites for the dissemination of watershed
> information and precipitation and streamflow data from thousands
>
> of gages around the country. Many of these sites are listed in
> Appendix E and on the textbook website
> ([http://hydrology.rice.edu/bedient).](http://hydrology.rice.edu/bedient))
>
> The government agencies in the United States have long performed vital
> research themselves, providing funding for private and university
> research in the hydrologic area. Many of the water resources studies
> and large dam, reservoir, and flood control projects in the 1930s and
> 1940s were a direct result of advances in the fields of fluid
> mechanics, hydrologic sys- tems, statistical hydrology, evaporation
> analysis, flood routing, and opera- tions research. Many of the
> advances from that era continue to this day as the methods to predict
> runoff, infiltration, and evaporation have not changed much in over 50
> years. Major contributions from Horton (1933, 1940, 1941) and from
> Penman (1948) in understanding hydrologic losses were related to the
> water and irrigation needs of the agricultural sector in the United
> States following the devastation of the dust bowl era of the 1930s.
>
> Major water resources projects built during the 1930s were a direct
> result of major floods on the Mississippi River and the economic
> depression across the nation. The building of the massive Hoover Dam
> on the Colorado River for flood and sediment control and water supply
> in the early 1930s provided employment for over 40,000 and was the
> largest construction proj- ect ever conceived to that point (see
> Chapters 12 and 13).
>
> **Modern History**
>
> In the 1950s and 1960s, the tremendous increase of urbanization
> following World War II in the United States and Europe led to better
> methods for predicting peak flows from floods, for understanding
> impacts from urban expansion, and for addressing variations in storage
> in water supply reservoirs. Major expansion of cities and water
> systems within the United States during the 1950s led to a need for
> better understanding of floods and droughts, especially in urban
> areas. Water resource studies became an everyday occur- rence in many
> rapidly developing areas of the United States, tied to the expansion
> of population centers in the southern, southwestern, and western
> states. Hydrologic analyses presented in detail in Chapters 2 through
> 9 in the text were a major component of many of these studies.
>
> During the 1970s and early 1980s, the evaluation and delineation of
> floodplain boundaries became a major function of hydrologists, as
> required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local
> flood control or drainage districts. In order for communities to be
> eligible for flood insurance administered by FEMA, they are required
> to delineate floodplain boundaries using hydrologic analysis and
> models. Floodplain analysis is cov- ered in detail in Chapters 5, 7,
> 9, and 12. This function has taken on a vital role in many urban
> areas, as damages from severe floods and hurricanes continue to plague
> the United States, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. The
> period from 2004 to 2010 accounted for numerous hurricanes that caused
> massive damages and deaths in several areas, especially along the
>
> coastlines of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The
> mas- sive Mississippi flood of 1993 wreaked havoc within the central
> United States, and was repeated in 2011 with major devastation to
> states from Illi- nois south to Louisiana (Chapter 12).
>
> In recent years, the traditional approaches to flood control have been
> reassessed. A study titled "Higher Ground" from the National Wildlife
> Fed- eration (1998) found a number of communities with large numbers
> of repet- itive flood losses, such as New Orleans and Houston. Since
> the great midwestern flood of 1993, there has been a significant shift
> in national flood policy away from using only structural solutions,
> such as levee and channel construction. Flood damage from Tropical
> Storm Allison in Houston in 2001 was a major wake-up call for better
> protection and warning systems in criti- cal urban areas. The massive
> devastation from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in August 2005 and
> Hurricane Ike in 2008 in Houston-Galveston will provide long-lasting
> incentive to improve our ability to warn for and recover from such
> severe storms. Modern methods for structural flood con- trol, as well
> as nonstructural approaches, better management of flood-prone areas,
> and voluntary property buyouts, must be considered in any overall
> flood management plan (Chapter 12). Chapter 13 explores several major
> water resources projects across the United States and Asia in terms of
> engi- neering significance as well as associated environmental and
> policy impacts on the nation.
>
> **Computer Advances**
>
> The introduction of the digital computer into hydrology during the
> 1960s and 1970s allowed complex water problems to be simulated as
> complete systems for the first time. Large computer models can now be
> used to match historical data and help answer difficult hydrologic
> questions (Singh and Frevert, 2006). The development of these tools
> over the past few decades has helped direct the collection of the
> hydrologic data to calibrate, or "match," the models against
> observation. In the process, the understanding of the hydrologic
> system has been greatly advanced. Hydrologic computer models developed
> in the 1970s have been applied to areas previously unstud- ied or only
> empirically defined. For example, urban stormwater, floodplain and
> watershed hydrology, drainage design, reservoir design and operation,
> flood frequency analysis, and large-river basin management have all
> bene- fited from the application of computer models.
>
> Hydrologic simulation models applied to watershed analysis are
> described in detail in Chapter 5. Single-event models such as HEC-HMS
> are used to simulate or calculate the resulting storm hydrograph
> (discharge vs. time) from a well-defined watershed area for a given
> pattern of rainfall intensity. Continuous models such as the
> Hydrological Simulation Pro- gram---Fortran (HSPF) and the Storm Water
> Management Model (SWMM) can account for soil moisture storage,
> evapotranspiration, and antecedent
>
> rainfall over long time periods. Statistical models can be used to
> generate a time series of rainfall or streamflow data, which can then
> be analyzed with flood frequency methods.
>
> Newer distributed hydrologic models (i.e., VFLO and the MIKE series of
> models) can handle input, output, and data manipulation at the
> watershed level (see Chapters 5, 10, 11, and 12). Unquestionably new
> digital approaches combined with distributed terrain modeling have
> revolutionized hydrology in recent years, just as the original wave of
> models did in the decade of the 1970s. Also faster computers and
> available datasets have been instrumental in advancing the field.
>
> The data revolution in hydrology and geographical information sys-
> tems (GIS) have made available newer and more accurate datasets on
> topog- raphy, slope, rainfall, soils, land use, and channel
> characteristics for many areas. Moreover, most hydrological and
> meteorological data may be retrieved online from agencies such as the
> USGS and NWS, and various county and municipal sources. These
> datasets, combined with existing simu- lation models in hydrology, if
> applied correctly, provide the most accurate approach to understanding
> complex water resources systems, and a new era in the science of
> hydrology has begun this decade. New design and operating policies are
> being advanced and implemented that could not have been real- ized or
> tested before without the aid of sophisticated computer models linked
> with digital data.

> **WEATHER SYSTEMS**
>
> The atmosphere is the major hydrologic link between oceans and
> continents on the planet, facilitating the cycle of water movement on
> earth. The hydro- logic cycle is shaped by the conditions of the
> atmosphere, with precipitation as the main input to the cycle. Water
> vapor content is both a major catalyst and a balancing factor of
> atmospheric processes that create the weather in the lower atmosphere.
> The following section reviews major elements of atmospheric processes
> that directly impact the hydrologic cycle. More details on atmospheric
> processes can be found in modern meteorology and hydrol- ogy textbooks
> (Anthes, 1997; Ahrens, 2000; Dingman, 2002).
>
> **Atmospheric Parameters**
>
> Pressure is defined as the force per unit area exerted on a surface,
> and **atmo- spheric pressure** measures the weight of the air per unit
> area. Average air pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atmosphere,
> or 1013 millibars (mb) or 14.7 lb/in.^2^ or 760 mm-Hg or 29.97 in.-Hg.
> Note that 1 mb = 10^2^ pascals (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m^2^. As
> elevation increases and the density of air molecules decreases,
> atmospheric pressure also decreases. The horizontal and vertical
> pressure variations that occur due to low- and high-pressure systems
> are responsible for wind, and help drive much of our weather. Abso-
> lute temperature (*T*), pressure (*P*), and density 1r2 are related
> through the
>
> ideal gas law, *P* = r*RT*, where *R* is the gas constant for the gas
> in question (see Eq. 1--1). At constant density, temperature is
> directly proportional to pressure; thus, with an increase in
> temperature comes an increase in pres- sure. Air pressure is
> proportional to density, so that in the atmosphere a decrease in
> temperature causes an increase in the density of the air mole- cules.
> Cold air masses are generally associated with the higher atmospheric
> pressure.
>
> **Humidity** is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the
> atmosphere and can be expressed in several ways. Specific humidity is
> the mass of water vapor in a unit mass of moist air. The **relative
> humidity** is a ratio of the air's actual water vapor content compared
> to the amount of water vapor at satu- ration for that temperature. The
> partial pressure of water vapor is the con- tribution made by water to
> the total atmospheric pressure. When a volume reaches its maximum
> capacity for water vapor, the volume is said to be satu- rated and can
> accept no more vapor. This vapor pressure is known as **satura- tion
> vapor pressure**. Vapor pressure is dependent on temperature; and as
> air is lifted and cools, its relative humidity increases until
> saturation, and then condensation of water vapor to liquid water can
> occur. The temperature to which a sample of air must be cooled to
> reach saturation is defined as the **dew point temperature**. These
> concepts are described in more detail later in this section.
>
> Water vapor has the ability, unique among gases, to change from one
> state of matter to another (solid, liquid, or gas) at the temperatures
> and pressures that typically exist on earth. A change in phase (e.g.,
> from liquid to vapor) requires that heat be released or absorbed. The
> processes of con- verting solid ice to liquid water, called melting,
> and water to vapor, called evaporation, both require significant heat
> exchange. It takes approximately 600 cal to convert 1 g of water to
> water vapor. When such changes take place, the heat is absorbed and no
> temperature change takes place. The heat used in this process is
> latent heat. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes
> into a liquid state. For this to occur, energy must be released in an
> amount equivalent to what was absorbed during evaporation. This latent
> heat often becomes the source of energy for severe thunderstorms,
> tornadoes, and hurricanes.
>
> **The Atmosphere and Clouds**
>
> Atmospheric weather systems are fueled by solar input and
> characterized by air masses in motion, circulating winds, cloud
> generation, and changes in tem- perature and pressure. Lifting
> mechanisms are required for moist air masses to cool and approach
> saturation conditions. As a result of the interaction of rising air
> masses with atmospheric moisture, the presence of small atmospheric
> nuclei, and droplet growth, precipitation in the form of rain, snow,
> or hail can result. The exact mechanisms that lead to precipitation
> are sometimes quite complex and difficult to predict for specific
> areas. But precipitation remains
>
> as the main input to the hydrologic cycle, and the hydrologist needs a
> general understanding of the mechanisms that cause its formation.
>
> Horizontal variations in atmospheric pressure cause air to move from
> higher pressure toward lower pressure, resulting in the generation of
> wind. Vertical displacement causes air to move as well, but at a far
> slower rate than horizontal winds. The vertical movement and lifting
> of air results in the formation of clouds. Clouds are familiar to all
> of us, and represent collec- tions of small droplets of water or tiny
> crystals of ice. The names of the basic clouds have the following
> roots:
>
> **cirrus**, feathery or fibrous clouds
>
> **stratus**, layered clouds
>
> **cumulus**, towering, puffy clouds **alto**, middle-level clouds
> **nimbus**, rain clouds
>
> The second aspect of cloud classification is by height. Anthes (1997)
> presents a detailed coverage of cloud types for the interested
> student. One type of high cloud of importance in hydrology is the
> **cumulonimbus**, one often found in heavy thunderstorms that produce
> massive rainfall. Cirrus clouds are very high collections of ice
> crystals and often indicate the approach of a cold front and that
> weather is about to change. While clouds result when air rises and
> cools, surface fog results from cooling near the surface or from the
> addition of enough water vapor to cause saturation. Fog is essentially
> a low cloud with a base that is very near the ground, often reducing
> the visibil- ity in the area within or around it. Marine fog is common
> along the Califor- nia and upper Atlantic coasts in the United States.
>
> **General Circulation**
>
> The general circulation of wind across the earth is caused by the
> uneven heating of earth's surface through solar input, and by the
> earth's rotation. At the equator, solar radiation input and
> temperature are greatest because of the shape and tilt of the globe
> relative to the sun. Three latitudinal circu- lation cells transport
> heat from the equator to the poles (Fig. 1--3). As warm air travels
> northward in the middle latitudinal cell on a spinning earth, it tends
> to shift to the right (toward the east) in the northern hemisphere due
> to the Coriolis force, thus causing the occurrence of winds called
> **westerlies**. These winds tend to drive the direction of major
> weather systems from west to east across major portions of the
> continental United States.
>
> Between 30 degrees north latitude and the equator, the flow is
> generally toward the south and is altered to create the trade winds
> (**easterlies**) by the Coriolis force in the northern hemisphere. The
> trade winds allowed explorers from Europe to sail across the ocean to
> the New World. The Coriolis force causes the flow along latitude
> circles (east/west) to be 10 times greater than

> the flow along the meridians (north/south). Around the 30 degrees
> north and south latitudes, descending air creates a region of minimal
> winds and little cloudiness that is known as the horse latitudes. Near
> the equator is another region of light and variable winds called the
> doldrums, or the intertropical convergence zone. This is the area of
> maximum solar heating, where surface air rises and flows toward both
> poles.
>
> **Jet streams**, first observed in 1946, are narrow bands of
> high-speed winds that circle each hemisphere like great rivers, at
> elevations extending from 2.5 or 3 miles to above the tropopause. The
> polar and subtropical jets are associated with the polar front near 45
> degrees latitude and 30 degrees latitude, respectively. The jet
> streams are highly variable and can flow at speeds as high as 100 mph
> faster than the air on either side of them. Jet streams have a major
> impact as the driving force for weather systems across the United
> States, especially in the winter season.
>
> **Air Masses and Fronts**
>
> Air masses are large bodies of air with fairly consistent temperature
> and humidity gradients in the horizontal direction at a given
> altitude. Air masses dominate our weather and are classified in two
> ways: the source from which
>
> they were generated, land (continental) or water (maritime), and the
> latitude of generation (polar or tropical). The four combinations are
> designated cP, cT, mP, and mT.
>
> Each of these types of air masses is present in the United States. The
> continental polar air mass emanates from Canada and passes over the
> north- ern United States, often dropping significant amounts of rain
> and snow on areas downwind of the Great Lakes. The maritime polar air
> mass also comes southward from the Atlantic coast of Canada and
> affects the New England states. Another maritime polar air mass comes
> from the Pacific and hits the extreme northwestern states. The
> maritime tropical air masses come from the Pacific, the Gulf of
> Mexico, and the Atlantic. The entire southern United States is
> affected by these air masses. The only time continental tropical air
> masses form is during the summer, and they originate in Texas and
> affect the states bordering to the north.
>
> The boundary between one air mass and another is called a frontal
> zone, or **front**. When two air masses meet, the front will slope
> diagonally, as the colder, denser air mass pushes under the warmer air
> mass. Between the two fronts, a transition zone occurs, usually 30 to
> 60 miles wide. Whether the masses are traveling against each other or
> in the same direction, the warmer air mass will be forced upward and
> cooled by expansion. Since cooling a parcel of air lowers its
> saturation vapor pressure, this may cause condensa- tion and the
> development of precipitation often associated with frontal sys- tems
> (Fig. 1--4). The NWS website provides an amazing amount of weather
> information and satellite data all on one place
> ([http://www.nws.noaa.gov/).](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/))

> Direction of the cold and warm fronts in the eastern United States.
> The cold fronts come from the North toward the Gulf and the warm
> fronts start from the Gulf to push inland.
>
> Development of surface cyclones along fronts occurs when an upper-
> level disturbance approaches a front. The upper-level patterns of
> conver- gence and divergence produce pressure changes at the surface,
> which then produce low-level circulation (**wave cyclone**). As a wave
> cyclone develops, low pressure forms at its apex and both the warm and
> cold currents move in a cyclonic pattern (counterclockwise in the
> northern hemisphere) around it. To the left of the apex, the cold
> front is advancing towards the warm air, and the warm front is
> receding to the right. The warm air between the fronts is known as the
> warm sector. The entire system generally moves toward the right
> (eastward), and ahead of the warm front the first sign of the
> approach- ing system is high cirrus clouds. As the center of low
> pressure approaches, the pressure falls and the wind increases and
> changes its direction to coun- terclockwise. The temperature begins to
> decrease as the frontal zone approaches. Within several hundred miles
> of the surface position of the front, precipitation begins, either
> rain or snow. Fronts can be fast moving in the winter or can be slowed
> or stalled due to the presence of other air masses or high-pressure
> systems in the fall or spring (Anthes, 1997). Warm fronts can also
> generate rainfalls as they move across an area.
>
> Fronts are a major factor in U.S. weather patterns, especially from
> September through April in most years. The type of weather
> accompanying the passage of the cold front depends on the front's
> sharpness, its speed, and the stability of the air being forced aloft.
> Often there are towering cumulus clouds and showers along the forward
> edge of the front. Sometimes, espe- cially in the Midwest during the
> spring, several **squalls**, or a strong line of storms, precede the
> front. Tornadoes can form in these storm cells, especially in areas of
> north Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. But in other cases, nim-
> bostratus clouds and rain extend over a zone of 50 to 60 miles. After
> the frontal passage, the wind changes sharply and the pressure begins
> to rise. Within a short distance behind the cold front, the weather
> clears, the tem- perature begins to fall, and the visibility greatly
> improves.

> **Thunderstorms**
>
> Thunderstorm activity is characterized by cumulonimbus clouds that can
> produce heavy rainfall, thunder, lightning, and occasionally hail.
> Thunder- storms are the result of strong vertical movements in the
> atmosphere and usually occur in the spring or summer in the United
> States. They require warm, moist air, which when lifted will release
> enough latent heat to provide the buoyancy needed to maintain its
> upward motion. Accordingly, they gen- erally occur in warm air masses
> that have become unstable either through extreme low-pressure systems,
> surface heating, or forced ascent over moun- tains. The geographic
> pattern of thunderstorm occurrence in the United States is a result of
> both an area's distance from source air masses and its topography.
> Florida and the Gulf Coast are affected most frequently, some- times
> as often as 100 times in a year.

> The Cumulonimbus cloud that signals that a storm is approaching.
>
> Thunderstorms develop in three characteristic stages. The first is the
> cumulus stage, when moist air rises and cools and condenses into a
> cumulus cloud. The cumulus cloud then continues to grow taller as the
> rising air condenses at successively higher levels (Fig. 1--5). The
> diameter of the storm cell grows in width from about 1 mile to 6 to 9
> miles and vertically to 5 or 6 miles. The rising air is no longer able
> to retain water droplets and rain begins to fall.
>
> The rain marks the beginning of the second stage of the thunder-
> storm, the mature stage. During the mature stage, the large water
> particles or hail in the clouds begin to fall because they have become
> too large to be supported by the updraft. As this happens, drier air
> around the cloud is being drawn into it, in a process known as
> entrainment. This drying of the air results in the evaporation of some
> rain drops, which cools the air. The air is now colder and heavier
> than the air around it and, while the upper part of the cloud still
> has a strong updraft, a lower part of the storm cloud begins to
> descend as a downdraft. This downdraft eventually reaches the ground
> and spreads away from the thunderstorm, causing the cool gusts of wind
> that usually foreshadow the arrival of a thunderstorm. Meanwhile, the
> upper part of the cloud reaches a stable part of the atmosphere, and
> high-altitude winds may create a typical anvil shape (Fig. 1--6). The
> cloud reaches its greatest vertical development in this stage,
> extending upward over 7.5 mi (40,000 ft, 12 km). Lightning,
> turbulence, heavy rains, and, if present, hail are all found at this
> time. The second stage is the most intense period of the thunderstorm.
>
> When the downdraft has spread over the entire storm cell and the
> updraft has been cut off, the storm begins its final stage, the
> dissipating stage. The rate of precipitation diminishes and so the
> downdrafts are also gradually subdued. The final flashes of lightning

> **Hurricanes**

> **Tropical cyclones** or **hurricanes** are intense cyclonic storms
> that form over the tropical oceans, between 5 and 20 degrees latitude.
> With extreme amounts of rainfall and winds that can exceed 186 mph
> (300 km/hr), trop- ical cyclones are the most destructive storms on
> earth. The local name for this storm varies throughout the world:
> typhoon in Eastern Asia, cyclone in India, and baguio in the China
> Sea. The North American term, used in this discussion, is hurricane.
> By international agreement, a storm is a hur- ricane if it has wind
> speeds of at least 74 mph (119 km/hr) and a rotary circulation. When
> its wind speeds are between 39 mph (63 km/hr) and 73 mph (119 km/hr),
> it is a tropical storm. Tropical disturbances with winds that do not
> exceed 39 mph (61 km/hr) are tropical depressions. All tropical storms
> and hurricanes are given proper names in alphabetical order, start-
> ing at the beginning of the alphabet when the storm season begins on
> June 1 and starting over during the next season. Hurricanes are
> classified accord- ing to a scale based on central pressure, storm
> surge height, and wind speed. The scale has five categories, ranging
> from category 1, a hurricane of minimal damage, to category 5, a
> hurricane of catastrophic proportions (see Table 1--1).

> The warm, moisture-laden air of the tropical oceans possesses an enor-

> condensation from vapor to water. Hurricanes develop most often during
> the late summer when the oceans are warm (26°C or higher) and are thus
> able to provide the necessary heat and moisture to the air. The
> hurricane season in the West Indies extends from June 1 to November 1,

> **Moisture Relationships**
>
> Atmospheric moisture is a necessary source for precipitation and is
> generally provided from evaporation and transpiration. Precipitation
> across the United States is largely due to proximity of evaporation
> from oceans and the Gulf of Mexico and to subsequent transport over
> the continent by the atmo- spheric circulation system. Common measures
> of atmospheric moisture, or humidity, include vapor pressure, specific
> humidity, mixing ratio, relative humidity, and dew point temperature.
> (Most of these terms were defined earlier in the chapter.) Under moist
> conditions, water vapor can be assumed to obey the ideal gas law,
> which allows derivation of simple relations between pressure, density,
> and temperature.
>
> The partial pressure is the pressure that would be exerted on the sur-
> face of a container by a particular gas in a mixture. The partial
> pressure exerted by water vapor is called **vapor pressure** and can
> be derived from Dalton's law and the ideal gas law as

>
> *R* = dry air gas constant = 2.87 \* 10^3^ mb cm^3^/g°K,
>
> *T* = absolute temperature (°K).
>
> The factor 0.622 arises from the ratio of the molecular weight of
> water (18) to that of air (29). Near the earth's surface, the water
> vapor pressure is 1% to 2% of the total atmospheric pressure, where
> average atmospheric pres- sure is 1013.2 mb (1 mb = 10^2^ pascals
> (Pa)). **Saturation vapor pressure** is the partial pressure of water
> vapor when the air is completely saturated (no further evaporation
> occurs) and is a function of temperature.
>
> **Relative humidity** (*RH*) is approximately the ratio of water vapor
> pressure to that which would prevail under saturated conditions at the
> same temperature. It can also be stated as *RH* = 100 *e*\>*e~s~*.
> Thus, 50% relative humidity means that the atmosphere contains 50% of
> the maximum moisture it could hold under saturated conditions at that
> temperature. Typical relative humidity averages (high and low
> percentages) for eight major American cities are as follows: Houston
> (89, 67), Seattle (84, 62), Chicago (80, 64), New York
>

>
> In order for vapor to condense to water to begin the formation of
> precipita- tion, a quantity of heat known as latent heat must be
> removed from the moist air. The **latent heat** of condensation *L~c~*
> is equal to the latent heat of evapora- tion *L~e~*, the amount of
> heat required to convert water to vapor at the same temperature. With
> *T* measured in °C,

*L~e~* = - *L~c~* = 597.3 - 0.57(*T* - 0°C), (1--5)

where *L~e~* is in cal/g. The latent heat of melting and freezing are
also related:

> *L~m~* = - *L~f~* = 79.7,
>
> where *L~m~* is also in cal/g. Thus, it takes about 7.5 times the
> energy to evapo- rate a gram of water compared to melting a gram of
> ice.
>
> As moist, unsaturated air rises, the relative humidity increases, and
> at some elevation saturation is reached and relative humidity becomes
> 100%. Fur- ther cooling of the air results in condensation of the
> moisture at a defined lifting condensation level (LCL). Latent heat of
> condensation is released, warming the air and lowering the atmospheric
> lapse rate, or the rate of temperature change with elevation. As
> discussed earlier, latent heat exchange is the major energy source
> that fuels tropical cyclones and hurricanes. It has also been observed
> that a relation does not necessarily exist between the amount of water
> vapor and the resulting precipitation over a region. Thus,
> condensation can occur in cloud formations without the production of
> precipitation at the ground surface.
>
> Meteorologists use the moisture relationships and the latent-heat con-
> cepts to obtain pressure--temperature relationships for cooling of
> rising moist air in the atmosphere. The rate of temperature change
> with elevation in the atmosphere is called the **adiabatic lapse
> rate**. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) is 9.8°C per km and
> assumes no phase changes of water. The average ambient lapse rate is
> about 6.5°C per km, but varies with moisture conditions. An unstable
> atmosphere is one in which the ambient lapse rate is greater than the
> DALR. A stable atmosphere is one in which the ambient lapse rate is
> less than the DALR, and an air parcel tends to cool faster than the
> environment as it rises vertically. Figure 1--8 shows the variation of
> lapse rates and different types of atmospheric conditions, with an
> unstable atmo- sphere being very conducive to lifting of moist air and
> to formation of severe weather and/or rainfall conditions.

    surroundings. The atmosphere is stable with respect to unsaturated,

3.  a phase change must occur with resulting condensation onto small
    nuclei in the air,

4.  droplets must grow large enough to overcome drag and evaporation to
    reach the ground.

> Orographic precipitation is caused by mechanical lifting of moist air
> over mountain ranges. Notable examples include the western side of the
> Cascade Mountains, the western side of the Andes in Chile, and the
> western coast of Norway. On the lee side of mountain barriers are dry
> areas, called rain shadows, since most of the moisture is dropped as
> rain or snow over the mountain ranges. Good examples of rain shadows
> can be found east of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and east of
> the Sierra Nevada range in California (see Fig. 1--10).

> **Condensation** of water vapor into cloud droplets occurs due to
> cooling of moist air to a temperature below the saturation point for
> water vapor. This is most commonly achieved through vertical lifting
> to levels where pressure and temperature are lower. A large portion of
> the atmospheric mass lies within 18,000 ft of the surface and contains
> most of the clouds and moisture. Condensation can be caused by (1)
> adiabatic cooling (no heat loss to sur- roundings), (2) mixing of air
> masses having different temperatures, (3) cool- ing by advection of
> cold air masses, and (4) cooling by radiation. Adiabatic cooling is by
> far the most important producer of appreciable precipitation.

> Small condensation nuclei must be present for the formation of cloud
> droplets. Such nuclei come from many sources, such as ocean salt, dust
> from clay soils, industrial combustion products, and volcanoes, and
> they range in size from 0.1 m to 10 m. Cloud droplets originally
> average 0.01 mm in diam- eter, and it is only when they exceed 0.5 mm
> that significant precipitation occurs. It may take hours for a small
> raindrop (1 mm) to grow on a conden- sation nucleus. As vapor-laden
> air rises, it cools as it expands; and as satura- tion occurs, water
> vapor begins to condense on the most active nuclei. The principal
> mechanism for the supply of water to the growing droplet in early
> stages is diffusion of water-vapor molecules down the vapor-pressure
> gradi- ent toward the droplet surface. As the droplets increase in
> mass, they begin to move relative to the overall cloud. However, other
> processes must support the growth of droplets of sufficient size
> (0.5--3.0 mm) to overcome air resis- tance and to fall as
> precipitation. These include the coalescence process and the
> ice-crystal process.
>
> The **coalescence process** is considered dominant in summer shower
> precipitation. As water droplets fall, the smaller ones are overtaken
> by larger ones, and droplet size is increased through collision. This
> can produce significant precipitation, especially in warm cumulus
> clouds in tropical regions. The **ice-crystal process** attracts
> condensation on freezing nuclei because of lower vapor pressures. The
> ice crystals grow in size through contact with other particles, and
> collisions cause snowflakes to form. Snow- flakes may change into rain
> droplets after entering air in which the tem- perature is above
> freezing. Snowfall and snowmelt processes are presented in detail in
> Chapter 2.

> **Point Measurement**
>
> The main source of moisture for annual rainfall totals is evaporation
> from the oceans; thus, precipitation tends to be heavier near the
> coastlines, with distor- tion due to orographic effects---that is,
> effects of changes in elevation over mountain ranges. In general,
> amount and frequency of precipitation is greater on the windward side
> of mountain barriers (the western side for the United States) and less
> on the lee side (eastern side), also shown in Figure 1--10.
> Considerable amounts of precipitation data are available from the NWS,
> the USGS, and various local governmental agencies. A number of useful
> websites for precipitation data are listed in Appendix E and on the
> textbook website
> [http://hydrology.rice.edu.](http://hydrology.rice.edu/)
> Interpretation of national networks of rainfall data shows extreme
> variability in space and time, as can be seen in annual and monthly
> variations in Figures 1--10 and 1--11, respectively.
>
> Time variation of precipitation occurs seasonally or within a single
> storm, and distributions vary with storm type, intensity, duration,

(c) Isohyetal method

> The **Thiessen polygon method** \[Fig. 1--16(b)\] allows for areal
> weighting of rainfall from each gage. Such a polygon is the locus of

> are drawn between stations located on a map. Perpendicular bisectors
> are drawn to form polygons around each gage, and the ratio of the area
> of each polygon *A~i~* within the watershed boundary to the total area
> *A~T~* is used to weigh each station's rainfall. The method is unique
> for each gage network and does not allow for orographic effects (those
> due to elevation changes), but it is probably the most widely used of
> the three available methods.
>
> The **isohyetal method** \[Fig. 1--16(c)\] involves drawing contours
> of equal precipitation (isohyets) and is the most accurate method.
> However, an extensive gage network is required to draw isohyets
> accurately. The rainfall calculation is based on finding the average
> rainfall between each pair of contours, multiplying by the area
> between them, totaling these products, and dividing by the total area.
> The isohyetal method can include orographic effects and storm
> morphology and can represent an accurate map of the rainfall pattern,

(a) For the arithmetic averaging method, only the gages within the
    watershed are used---in this example the gages B and D. Thus, the
    arithmetic average is

> (6.74 + 6.01)\>2 = 6.38 in.

(b) The first step in the Thiessen polygon method is to connect all
    nearby rain gages by straight lines. The result is a system of tri-
    angles, as shown by the dashed lines in Figure E1--3b. Next, we
    construct perpendicular bisectors of the dashed lines in Figure
    E1--3c. The bisectors meet at a common point inside or outside the
    triangle. The resulting polygons around each rainfall gage are known
    as the Thiessen polygons.

> **SIMPLE RAINFALL-- RUNOFF**
>
> One of the simplest rainfall--runoff formulas, which is often used for
> drainage design purposes in small watersheds and/or basins, is the

> prediction of peak flow *Q~p~* (cfs) from the formula

where

> *Q~p~* = *CiA* (1--13)
>
> *C* = runoff coefficient, variable with land use,
>
> *i* = intensity of rainfall of chosen frequency for a duration equal

>
> *t~c~* = equilibrium time for rainfall occurring at the most remote
> portion of the basin to contribute flow at the outlet (min or hr),
>
> *A* = area of watershed (acres).
>
> The Rational Method is usually attributed to Kuichling (1889) and
> Lloyd- Davies (1906), but Mulvaney (1851) clearly outlined the
> procedure in a paper in Ireland. The underlying assumption is that a
> steady, uniform rainfall rate will produce maximum runoff when all
> parts of a watershed are contributing to out- flow, a condition that
> is met after the time of concentration *t~c~* has elapsed. Time of
> concentration *t~c~* is defined as the time for a wave of water to
> propagate from the most distant point in the basin to the outlet (see
> Section 2.1). Runoff is as- sumed to reach a maximum when the rainfall
> intensity lasts as long as the *t~c~*. The runoff coefficient is
> assumed constant during a storm event. More details can be found in

> systems, culverts, and open channels. Chapters 6 and 9 present
> detailed discussion and examples of the rational method applied to
> small watershed areas. Larger wa- tersheds (greater than a few square

**STREAMFLOW**

> The hydrologic cycle is shown as a schematic in Figure 1--1, where
> precipita- tion *P* initially falls on the land surface, and it may
> distribute to fill **depres- sion storage**, infiltrate to become soil
> moisture and shallow ground water, or travel as interflow to a
> receiving stream. Evaporation *E* is often a small component of a
> specific storm event, since it is minimal as rain is actually falling,
> and is usually only a factor in longer-term water balances. Depression
> storage capacity is usually satisfied early in storm passage, followed
> by infil- tration capacity into the soil (see Fig. 1--20). Eventually,
> overland flow and surface runoff commence after soil storage and
> depression storage are satis- fied. Overland flow then quickly moves
> down-gradient toward the nearest small rivulet or channel, which then

> The classic concept of streamflow generation by **overland flow** is

> heterogeneity, which exists across natural watersheds, and developed
> the partial area con- tribution concept (Betson, 1964). This model
> recognized that only certain portions of a watershed regularly
> contribute overland flow to streams and that no more than about 10% of
> a watershed contributes overland flow. In urban environments with
> large areas of impervious cover, the overland flow percentage may be
> larger. Significant surface runoff occurs only after rainfall
> intensity exceeds infiltration capacity, or (*i* 7 *f*) and soil
> moisture storage has been filled. Infiltration *f* is the loss rate
> into the soil system.
>
> The channel may contain a certain amount of **baseflow** coming from
> ground water and soil contributions even in the absence of rainfall.
> Discharge from rainfall excess, after infiltration losses have been
> subtracted, makes up the **direct-runoff hydrograph (DRO)**. The total
> storm hydrograph consists of direct runoff plus baseflow. The duration
> of rainfall determines the portion of watershed area contributing to
> the peak, and the intensity of rainfall deter- mines the resulting
> peak flow rate. If rainfall maintains a constant intensity for a very
> long time, maximum storage is achieved and a state of equilibrium dis-
> charge is reached, where the hydrograph tends to level off to a
> constant value for a period of time. The condition of equilibrium
> discharge is seldom attained over a large basin in nature because of
> the variability of actual rainfall.

> Chapters 6 and 9). As can be seen, the shape and timing of the
> hydrograph are largely related to watershed shape characteristics, and

> intensity. The contributions also depend on the level of **soil
> moisture storage** *S~D~* vs. **field capacity** *F* of the soil,
> which is defined as the amount of water held in place after excess

>
> However, the extreme case where both *i* 7 *f* and *F* 7 *S~D~* is
> typical of a large storm event in which direct surface runoff,
> interflow, and base flow all contribute to the hydrograph. In this
> case, the intensity of rainfall domi- nates the system, and large

> the response. In more forested and natural watersheds, infiltration
> and surface roughness may be major factors and significantly alter the
> hydrograph.
>
> Infiltration is one of the most complex of hydrologic phenomena. Hor-
> ton (1933) showed that when the rainfall rate *i* exceeds the
> infiltration rate *f*, water infiltrates the surface soils at a rate
> that generally decreases with time (Fig. 1--28). These rates are
> usually reported in inches per hour. For any given soil, a limiting

> **Recession and Base Flow Separation**
>
> It is generally customary to consider the hydrograph to be divided
> into only two parts: direct runoff (DRO) and base flow (BF), as shown
> in Figures 1--26 and 1--27. DRO may include some interflow, whereas
> base flow is considered to be mostly from contributing ground water.
> In most urban streams, base flow will be a relatively small component,
> usually less than a few percent, while it can be a significant
> component in a large river basin.
>
> Several techniques exist to separate DRO from base flow based on the

>
> where
>
> *q*~0~ = specified initial discharge, *q~t~* = discharge at a later

>
> Equations of this form are used often in engineering to describe
> first-order decay or depletion. Equation (1--14) will plot as a
> straight-line depletion curve on semilogarithmic paper, and the
> difference between this curve and
>
> the total hydrograph plotted on the same paper represents the DRO.
> Several storms should be used in order to develop a master depletion
> curve (Mc- Cuen, 2005). In practice, there are three simpler methods
> for handling base flow separation. The base flow recession can be
> extended forward under the peak of the hydrograph, starting with the
> point of lowest discharge and then extending at constant discharge to
> a point on the recession limb (*AD* in Fig. 1--27). The inflection
> point on the recession is assumed to be the point where the DRO ends.
> A second method is the concave method, where base flow is extended
> under the peak of the hydrograph and then is connected to the
> inflection point on the recession curve (*ABC*). Figure 1--27 shows
> two of the above methods. Computerized methods for base flow
> separation are also available (Sloto and Crouse, 1996).
>
> The separation methods all suffer the disadvantage of being arbitrary
> and somewhat inaccurate. At present, base flow separation is more an
> art than a science. In many cases of practical interest such as urban
> drainage, base flow is often neglected because it represents such a
> small component. Base flow is usually more important in natural
> streams and large rivers because of the contribution along the banks
> from a water table.

> **Net Storm Rainfall and the Hydrograph**
>
> Surface runoff phenomena have been discussed above, and the
> distribution of gross rainfall can be divided into components of
> infiltration, depression storage, detention storage, and direct
> runoff. We can write the continuity equation for this process as

> It is often important to determine the time distribution for rainfall

> rainfall excess include the Horton infiltration method and the f index
> method, with initial loss included for depression storage, as shown in

> rainfall and hydrograph vol- umes using various infiltration equations
> (i.e., compute in./hr over the water- shed area), as described in
> detail in Example 1.6. The Horton method estimates infiltration with

> **HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT**
>
> Hydrologic processes vary in space and time, and accurate measurement
> requires the use of sophisticated instruments, which are usually at a
> fixed location in space. The resulting data from rainfall,
> evaporation, or stream- flow levels measured over time create a time
> series, which may be further analyzed statistically. The overall
> sequence of steps for hydrologic measure- ment includes

1.  Sensing, which transforms the intensity of the process into a
    measur- able signal;

2.  Recording, usually in electronic form;

3.  Transmitting to a central processing site via telemetry;

4.  Translating, which converts the record into a data sequence;

5.  Editing, or checking for any errors in the data;

6.  Storing, in a computer database for viewing;

7.  Retrieving the data for further use.

> The advent of advanced telemetry, radar systems, use of the Internet,
> and use of large database storage devices has revolutionized
> hydrologic informa- tion storage, retrieval, and distribution. A
> number of useful websites often used in hydrology for rainfall and
> streamflow data are listed in Appendix E.
>
> **Atmospheric Parameters and Precipitation**
>
> The measurement of atmospheric moisture near the ground often utilizes
> a climate station, which usually consists of a psychrometer (or
> hygrometer) to measure humidity, a rainfall gage, an evaporation pan,
> and an anemometer for wind speed and direction. Total incoming or
> outgoing radiation can be measured with a radiometer. Weather balloons
> are used to measure tem- perature, humidity, air pressure, and wind
> speed at various elevations above the earth.
>
> The fundamental instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure is the
> mercurial **barometer**, which is constructed by filling a long glass
> tube with mercury. The barometer acts as a weighing balance, and
> changes in atmo- spheric pressure are detected from changes in the
> height of the column of mercury. The **psychrometer** is an instrument
> based on temperature differ- ences between two thermometers, one of
> which is covered in a wet cloth, called the wet bulb. The difference
> in temperature of the dry and wet bulbs, when ventilated, is a measure
> of degree of saturation of the air, which is a measure of relative
> humidity.
>
> Precipitation or rainfall is measured at a point with either
> non-recording or recording gages. The non-recording gage consists of a
> simple open tube with readings along the side for visually determining
> rainfall amounts. Recording gages are required in urban settings for
> flood control studies if the time distribution of rainfall is desired.
> The tipping bucket recording gage operates off a pair of small buckets
> (Fig. 1--14a), which move in a flip-flop motion and make electrical
> contact for every increment of rainfall. The buck- ets direct water
> into a reservoir, which can be checked for cumulative totals at the
> end of a storm event. The gage usually records every 0.01 in. or 0.1
> in. of rain and telemeters this to a central computer for storage and
> analysis.
>
> **Radar** (radio detection and ranging) has been used to measure
> rainfall rates on the ground since 1994, and GIS methods have greatly
> improved our ability to determine rainfall rates for specific
> watershed areas. Chapter 11 presents more details.
>
> **Evaporation and Infiltration Losses**
>
> **Evaporation** is the process by which water in its liquid or solid
> state is trans- formed into water vapor, which mixes with the
> atmosphere. **Evapotranspi- ration** (*ET*) is considered separately
> as the combined loss of water vapor from the surface of plants
> (transpiration) and the evaporation of moisture from soil. Knowledge
> of evaporation processes is important in predicting water losses to
> evaporation from a lake or reservoir. On average, approxi- mately 70%
> of the mean annual rainfall in the United States is returned to the
> atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration. However, variations in
> evaporation across the continent can be very large due to effects of
> solar input, location of mountains, and proximity to oceans. On an
> annual basis, evaporation rates can exceed mean annual rainfall,
> especially in arid regions
>
> of the southwest. For example, arid areas in Texas, Arizona, New
> Mexico, Nevada, and southern California can exceed 70 inches per year,
> compared to about 30 to 40 inches per year for much of the rest of the
> country. For the case of evaporation from a lake surface, water loss
> is a function of solar radiation, temperature of the water and air,
> difference in vapor pressure between water and the overlying air, and
> wind speed across the lake.
>
> Evaporation is important in the long-term water balance and is usually
> of concern for large-scale water resources planning and water supply
> studies, especially in the Western states where evaporation rates can
> exceed rainfall rates. During typical storm periods, with intensities
> of 0.5 in./hr, evaporation is on the order of 0.01 in./hr and is
> normally neglected for flood flow studies and urban drainage design
> applications.
>
> Measurement of evaporation is usually from a standard class A pan
> (Fig. 1--29), which is filled to 8 in. and then observed on a daily
> basis. Adjust- ments are made for rainfall input using a rainfall gage
> nearby. Methods to compute and measure evaporation and
> evapotranspiration are covered in detail in Section 2.6. Evaporation
> and ET are very difficult to measure accu- rately for large
> watersheds.
>
> **Infiltration**, or movement of water from the surface into the soil
> zone, can be measured with a ring infiltrometer, which is a ring about
> 2 ft in diam- eter driven into the soil. Water is placed in the ring,
> and the rate of infiltra- tion, *f*, is measured by the drop in water
> level over time. Carefully controlled experiments require the use of
> tensiometers to measure capillary suction with depth, electrical
> resistance to record moisture content, and wells to record the
> response at the water table below. Infiltration is one of the most
> difficult hydrologic parameters to measure because of the extreme
> variations in soil and water conditions, which can greatly affect the
> measured rate. In actual watersheds, infiltration is often determined
> by the difference between gross rainfall and direct runoff measured
> from a hydrograph. Both simple and advanced infiltration methods are
> presented in Sections 2.7 and 2.8.

> **Streamflow Measurement**
>
> Streamflow is generally measured by observing stage, or elevation
> above a specified elevation datum (i.e., mean sea level), in a channel
> and then relat- ing stage to discharge via a rating curve. A staff
> gage is a fixed scale set so that a portion is immersed in water and
> can be read manually during storm passage. A wire-weight gage is
> lowered from a bridge structure to the water surface, and readings are
> taken as a function of time through a storm event. A crest stage gage
> uses a small amount of cork inside an enclosed staff gage. The cork
> floats as the water rises and adheres to the scale recording at the
> highest water level.
>
> Most automatic recording gages, such as those used by the USGS for
> routine streamflow monitoring, use a float-type device to measure
> stage or a gas bubbler to measure pressure (Fig. 1--30a). The bubble
> gage senses water level by maintaining a continuous stream of gas in a
> small pipe under the water. Another approach is to use a pressure
> transducer near the bottom of a stream that senses the pressure or
> height of water that sits above the monitor. In some urban basins,
> hydrologic data are often transmitted over telephone lines or through
> telemetry directly into computers. Acoustic Doppler flow meters (ADFM)
> have recently emerged as a new method to accurately measure flow rate
> by measuring the actual velocity profile in a pipe or open channel.

> 0.2*D* and 0.8*D* (down from the surface), where *D* is stream depth,
> and average the two values (see Fig. 1--30b).
>
> The total discharge is found by dividing the channel into several
> sections, as shown in Figure 1--30b. The average velocity of each
> section is multiplied by its associated area (width times depth of
> section), and these are summed across the channel to yield total
> discharge *Q* corre- sponding to a particular stage *z*, obtaining one
> point on the graph in Fig- ure 1--31. Other points are obtained by
> measuring velocity at different stages in the stream. Rating curves
> can change through time, as water- sheds change in terms of land use
> and channel type, and should be rechecked periodically.
>
> It will be shown in Chapter 4 that actual rating curves can be looped
> because of storage and hydraulic effects in the channel, and the
> single- valued rating curve is at best an approximation to the actual
> relationship (see Fig. 4--14). A more detailed discussion of
> streamflow prediction and measurement is contained in Chapter 4.

> is equipped with telemetry for radio signals back to a base station or

> **CONCEPT CHECK**

1.  What is the hydrologic cycle? What are the pathways that
    precipitation falling onto the land surface of the earth is
    dispersed to the hydrologic cycle?

2.  Who is responsible for the first recorded rainfall measurements?
    Describe the technique used to obtain these measurements.

3.  Explain the difference between humidity and relative humidity.

4.  Explain how air masses are classified. Where are these types of air
    masses located?

5.  List seven major factors that determine a watershed's response to a
    given rainfall.

> **PROBLEMS**

6.  A lake with a surface area of 750 acres was monitored over a period
    of time. During a one-month period, the inflow was 35 cfs, the
    outflow was 28 cfs, and a 1.5-in. seepage loss was measured. During
    the same month, the total precipita- tion was 4.8 in. Evaporation
    loss was estimated as 6.0 in. Estimate the storage change for this
    lake during the month.

7.  Clear Lake has a surface area of 610,000 m^2^ (61.0 ha). For a given
    month, the lake has an inflow of 1.5 m^3^/s and an outflow of 1.25
    m^3^/s. A + 1.0-m storage change or increase in lake level was
    recorded. If a precipitation gage recorded a total of 20 cm for this
    month, determine the evaporation loss (in cm) for the lake. Assume
    that seepage loss is negligible.

8.  In a given month, a watershed with an area of 1500 m^2^ received 100
    cm of precipitation. During the same month, the loss due to
    evaporation was 15 cm. Ignore losses due to transpiration and
    infiltration due to ground water. What would be the average rate of
    flow measured in a gage at the outlet of the wa- tershed in
    *m*^3^\>day?

9.  In a given year, a watershed with an area of 2000 km^2^ received 120
    cm of precipitation. The average rate of flow measured in a gage at
    the outlet of the watershed was 30 m^3^/sec. Estimate the water
    losses due to the combined effects of evaporation, transpiration,
    and infiltration due to ground water. How much runoff reached the
    river for the year (in cm)?

10. Using the data from problem 1.9, what is the runoff coefficient?

11. Plot Equation (1--4) as a graph (*e~s~* vs. *T*) for a range of
    temperatures from

> \- 305C to 405C and a range of pressures from 0 to 70 mb. The area
> below the curve represents the unsaturated air condition. Using this
> graph, answer the following:

a.  Select two saturated and two unsaturated samples of air from the
    dataset of pressure and temperature given below:

> Pressure (mb): {10, 20, 30}
>
> Temperature (5C): {10, 20, 30}

b.  Let A and B be two air samples, where A: (*T* = 30°C, *P* = 20 mb)
    and B: (*T* = 30°C, *P* = 40 mb). For each sample, determine the
    following:

    i.  Saturation vapor pressure

    ii. Dew point

    iii. Relative humidity

c.  Suppose both samples A and B were cooled to 20°C. What would be
    their relative humidity? What would be their dew point temperature?

12. The gas constant *R* has the value 2.87 × 10^6^ cm^2^/s^2^ °K for
    dry air, when pres- sure is in mb. Using the ideal gas law (*P* =
    r*RT*), find the density of dry air at 255C with a pressure of 1150
    mb. Find the density of moist air at the same pressure and
    temperature if the relative humidity is 65%.

13. At a weather station, the air pressure was measured to be 95.1 kPa,
    the air temperature was 225C, and the dew point temperature was
    185C. Calculate the corresponding vapor pressure, relative humidity,
    specific humidity, and air density. First compute *e* and *e~s~*.

14. What are the three main mechanisms for generation of vertical air
    motion?

15. Describe the naming system for describing basic clouds.

16. Below are three different atmospheric systems. The dashed line
    represents the dry adiabatic lapse rate where as the solid line
    represents the dry ambient lapse rate. Label whether the atmosphere
    is stable, unstable, or neutral:

21. Table P1--21 lists rainfall data recorded at a USGS gage for the
    storm of Sep- tember 1, 1999. The basin area is 2050 acres. Using
    these data, develop a rain- fall hyetograph (in./hr vs. *t*) in
    15-min intervals and determine the time period with the highest
    intensity rainfall.

23. What is the runoff coefficient for the September 1, 1999, storm,
    > where Coeff.

> = *R*\>*P*?

24. The following questions refer to Figure 1--15, the IDF curve for
    > Houston, Texas.

    a.  What is the return period of a storm that recorded 3.1 in./hr
        > for 2 hr in Houston?

    b.  What amount of rain (in.) would have to fall in a 6-hr period to
        > be consid- ered a 100-yr storm in Houston?

    c.  What is the return period of a storm that lasts 1 hr and records
        > 3.5 in. of rainfall?

    d.  Develop and plot a 6-hr, 100-yr storm design rainfall using 1-hr
        > time steps (see Fig. 1--8). Assume the maximum hourly value
        > occurs between hours 3 and 4.

        i.  Find the rainfall intensity for a 1-hr duration and plot the
            > rainfall intensity in in./hr between the hours of 3 and 4
            > on a bar graph.

        ii. Then, find the rainfall intensity for a 2-hr duration;
            > multiply the in- tensity by the duration of rain to get
            > the volume. Plot the difference between the 2-hr duration
            > volume and the 1-hr duration volume for hour 2 to 3 on a
            > bar graph.

        iii. Continue in the same way for the 3-hr duration, plotting
             > the new intensity to the right of the maximum (hour
             > between 4--5). (Find the 3-hr volume and subtract the
             > 2-hr volume.)

        iv. Then, find the rainfall intensity for a 6-hr duration and
            the respective volume. Plot the remaining volume (6-hr minus
            3-hr) over the 3 hr, assuming equal distribution between
            them, with two bars to the left and one to the right of the
            maximum (time intervals 0--1, 1--2, and 5--6).

25. Given the stream section shown in Figure P1--25 and the following
    measure- ments, calculate the total discharge throughout the section
    (Table P1--25).

26. Assume that stations B through L in Problem 1--25 have all become
    0.2 ft deeper. In addition, a tributary has joined the stream and
    added approximately 600 cfs to the flow in the channel. Calculate
    the new discharge amounts for each station by altering the depths
    and adding the tributary's contribution across the channel in
    proportion to the modified discharge distribution. As- sume velocity
    distribution remains unchanged.

27. The incremental rainfall data in the table were recorded at a
    > rainfall gage on a small urban parking lot of 1 acre. Be careful
    > to use a 0.5-hr time step and record intensity in cm/hr.

    a.  Plot the rainfall hyetograph.

    b.  Determine the total storm rainfall depth (inches).

    c.  If 100% of the rainfall occurs as runoff and the time base of a
        > triangular hydrograph (flow rate vs. time) is 3 hr, find the
        > peak flow of the hydro- graph in cfs. Be careful with units.

> *Hint:* First find the volume of rainfall, then equate it to the area
> under the hydrograph.

**2.1**

> **WATERSHED CONCEPTS**
>
> **88**
>
> The **watershed** is the basic unit used in most hydrologic
> calculations relating to the water balance or computation of
> rainfall--runoff and other losses. The **watershed boundary** defines
> a contiguous area, such that the net rainfall or runoff over that area
> will contribute water to the outlet (Fig. 1--19(b)). Rain that falls
> outside the watershed boundary will generate runoff to some other
> outlet. A watershed boundary can be drawn from a topographic map by
> defining the ridgeline to the outlet, and runoff will generally travel
> from higher to lower elevation in a direction perpendicular to the
> elevation con- tours (see Fig. 1--19(b)).
>
> Hydrologists are most often concerned with the amount of surface
> runoff generated within a watershed that becomes streamflow for a
> given input rainfall pattern. The main watershed characteristics that
> affect hydro- logic response include the size, shape, slope, soil
> type, and storage within a watershed area. These issues are described
> in some detail in this chapter and form the basis for more detailed
> analyses in later chapters. The **hydrograph**, as presented earlier,
> is a plot of flow rate vs. time for a given location within a stream
> and represents the main hydrologic response function. Several
>
> example watersheds were depicted in Figure 1--19(a), and a typical
> water- shed with subareas depicted is shown in Figure 1--22.
>
> Watersheds are often characterized by one main channel and by tribu-
> taries that drain into a main channel at one or more confluence
> points. The subarea of a tributary can be delineated by starting at
> the confluence and drawing a boundary along the subarea ridgeline.
> Larger watersheds can have many subareas that contribute runoff to a
> single outlet. An important water- shed parameter is drainage area
> *A*, since it reflects the volume of water that can be generated from
> rainfall. Watershed length measures are depicted for subarea E in
> Figure 1--22. Channel length *L* is usually measured along the main
> channel from the outlet to the basin divide. Length to centroid *L~c~*
> is measured along the main channel to a point nearest the centroid
> (center of mass) of the watershed. These two length parameters help
> determine water- shed shape and are used extensively in unit
> hydrograph calculations dis- cussed later (Section 2.3).
>
> Another important physiographic parameter is **channel slope *S ***or
> **watershed slope *S*~0~**, which reflects the rate of change of
> elevation with dis- tance along the main channel or within an overland
> flow area. Both slope measures are used in performing unit hydrograph,
> flood routing, and time- of-travel calculations. Slope estimates are
> used in several of the unit hydro- graph methods described later in
> this chapter. Field surveys or topographic maps, either paper or
> electronic, can be used to measure elevation changes so that watershed
> or channel slopes can be determined.
>
> **Soil types** in a watershed are critical, as they determine
> infiltration rates that can occur for the area. Soil properties can
> vary significantly across a watershed area, and the USDA Natural
> Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is responsible for developing
> soils maps to provide information on soil type, soil texture, and
> hydrologic soil groups. The three main soil classes are characterized
> by particle diameter *d* in mm, for sand, silt, and clay. Typical
> values are listed in Table 8--2 in Chapter 8. Soil texture is
> important in determining water-holding capacity and infiltration
> capacity of a soil layer. Thus, sands generally infiltrate water at a
> greater rate than do silts or clays. Of course, there can be mixtures
> of sizes, which can complicate the overall soil structure. The NRCS
> classified thousands of soils on the basis of runoff potential and
> grouped them into four hydrologic soil groups, A, B, C, and D. Type A
> infiltrates at the highest rate, D at the lowest. The relationship of
> soil type to infiltration capacity is presented in detail in Sec-
> tions 2.8 and 2.9.
>
> **Land use and land cover**, in the form of parking lots and urban
> develop- ment, can have profound effects on watershed response. In
> fact, many of the methods described later were developed to address
> urban development impacts in a watershed. For example, the **Rational
> Method** \[see Eq. (1--13)\] uses a coefficient *C* to reflect the
> runoff potential of a watershed. The value of *C* for commercial
> (0.75) is greater than residential (0.3), which is greater than
> forested (0.15), indicating that more intense development generates
>
> greater rates of runoff for the same rainfall (see Sections 6.4 and
> 9.3). Urban development is also characterized by the percent
> imperviousness, or paved area, which can range from 50% to 90% for
> commercial compared to 20% to 40% for residential areas (see Table
> 2--1). Several of the unit hydrograph methods (Section 2.3) contain
> parameters that relate to urban land use effects.

> **UNIT HYDROGRAPH**

**THEORY**

> Sherman (1932) originally advanced the theory of the unit hydrograph
> (UH), defined as "basin outflow resulting from 1.0 inch (1.0 mm) of
> direct runoff generated uniformly over the drainage area at a uniform
> rainfall rate during a specified period of rainfall duration." An
> important point here is that UH is composed of 1.0 inch of direct
> runoff, which is equivalent to 1.0 inch of net rainfall for a given
> duration, *D*, and therefore all losses to infiltration must be
> subtracted before computations. Several assumptions inherent in the
> unit hydrograph approach tend to limit its application for any given
> watershed (Johnstone and Cross, 1949):

1.  Rainfall excesses of equal duration are assumed to produce
    hydrographs with equivalent time bases regardless of the intensity
    of the rain.

2.  Direct runoff ordinates for a storm of given duration are assumed
    directly proportional to rainfall excess volumes. Thus, twice the
    rain- fall produces a doubling of hydrograph ordinates.

3.  The time distribution of direct runoff is assumed independent of
    antecedent precipitation.

4.  Rainfall distribution is assumed to be the same for all storms of
    equal duration, both spatially and temporally.

> The classic statement of unit hydrograph theory can be summarized
> briefly: The hydrologic system is linear and time invariant (Dooge,
> 1973). The linear assumption implies that complex storm hydrographs
> can be pro- duced by adding up individual unit hydrographs, adjusted
> for rainfall vol- umes and added and lagged in time. For example, a
> 2-inch rainfall in X hours will produce double the response of 1 inch
> falling in X hours over a given watershed. While the assumptions of
> linearity and time invariance are not strictly correct for every
> watershed, we adopt them as long as they are useful. Nonlinear
> examples exist in open-channel flow, laboratory runoff models, and
> actual watersheds.

> a rising limb, a crest segment, and a recession curve (see Fig.

> and **time to peak**, *t~p~*, are also illustrated. The main timing
> aspects of the hydrograph can be charac- terized by the following
> parameters:

1.  **Duration** of rainfall excess (*D*): the time from start to finish
    > of rain- fall excess.

2.  **Lag time** (*t~p~*): the time from the center of mass of rainfall
    > excess to the peak of the hydrograph.

3.  **Time of rise** (*T~R~*): the time from the start of rainfall
    > excess to the peak of the hydrograph.

4.  **Time of concentration** (*t~c~*): the time for a wave (of water)
    > to propa- gate from the most distant point in the watershed to the
    > outlet. One estimate is the time from the end of net rainfall to
    > the inflection point of the hydrograph.

5.  **Time base** (*T~b~*): the total duration of the DRO hydrograph.

> If rainfall--runoff data exist, it is useful to develop unit
> hydrographs from measured rainfall events and streamflow from gages in
> a defined water- shed. The following general rules should be observed
> in developing unit hydrographs from gauged watersheds:

1.  Storms should be selected with a simple structure with relatively
    > uniform spatial and temporal distributions.

2.  Watershed sizes should generally fall between 1.0 and 100 mi^2^ in
    > modern watershed analysis.

3.  Direct runoff should range from 0.5 to 2.0 in.

4.  Duration of rainfall excess *D* should be approximately 25% to 30%
    > of lag time *t~p~*.

5.  A number of storms of similar duration should be analyzed to obtain
    > an average unit hydrograph for that duration.

6.  Step 5 should be repeated for several rainfalls of different
    > duration.

> The following are the essential steps for developing a unit hydrograph
> from a single storm hydrograph (see Fig. 2--1 and Example 2--1):

1.  Analyze the hydrograph and separate base flow.

2.  Measure the total volume of DRO under the hydrograph and con- vert
    > this to inches (mm) over the watershed.

3.  Convert total rainfall to rainfall excess through infiltration
    > methods, such that rainfall excess = DRO, and evaluate duration
    > *D* of the rainfall excess that produced the DRO hydrograph.

4.  Divide the ordinates of the DRO hydrograph (Fig. 2--1(b)) by the
    > volume in inches (mm) and plot these results as the unit
    > hydrograph

> for the basin (Fig. 2--1(c)). The time base *T~b~* is assumed constant
> for storms of equal duration and thus it will not change.

5.  Check the volume of the unit hydrograph to make sure that it is 1.0
    in. (1.0 mm), and graphically adjust ordinates as required.

> Because of assumptions of linearity inherent in the UH development,

> long-duration storm, assumptions of linearity may be violated. Also,
> if storage effects in the water- shed are important, assumptions may
> be violated. For large watersheds (above 100--500 mi^2^), it is
> usually advisable to divide the watershed into a number of subareas so
> that individual UHs can be developed for each. Typ- ically, UH should
> not exceed areas of 5 to 10 sq mi.
>
> Amount of runoff and areal distribution of runoff can cause variations
> in the shape of the hydrograph. For large basins, it is usually best
> to develop UHs for subareas and then add and lag, or convolute, them
> together to gen- erate an overall hydrograph. Peaks of UHs derived
> from very small events are often lower than those derived from larger
> storms because of differences in interflow and channel flow times.
> Assumptions of linearity can usually be verified by comparing
> hydrographs from storms of various magnitudes. If nonlinearity does
> exist, then derived UHs should be used only for generating events of
> similar magnitude, and caution should be exercised in using unit
> hydrographs to extrapolate to extreme events. Despite these
> limitations, when unit hydrographs have been used in conjunction with
> modern flood routing methods, resulting flood prediction for small and
> large basins is quite accurate. Detailed applications of the unit
> hydrograph are presented later in this chapter and in Chapters 5 and
> 9.
>
> **S-Curve Method**
>
> A UH for a particular watershed is defined for a specific duration *D*
> of rainfall excess (RF~net~). The linear property of the UH can be
> used to gen- erate a UH of larger or smaller duration. For example,
> given a 1-hr UH for a particular watershed, a UH resulting from a 2-hr
> unit storm can be developed by adding two 1-hr UHs, the second one
> lagged by 1 hr, adding together the ordinates, and dividing the result
> by 2. In this way, the 1 in. of rainfall in 1 hr has been distributed
> uniformly over 2 hr in deriving the 2-hr UH (Fig. 2--2). This lagging
> procedure is restricted to integer multi- ples of the original
> duration. In the same way, the 3-hr UH results from adding and lagging
> three together and dividing the ordinates by 3 (see Example 2--3).
>
> The **S-curve method** allows construction of a UH of any duration.
> Assume that a UH of duration *D* is known and that we wish to generate
> a UH for the same watershed with duration *D*\'. The first step is to
> generate the S-curve hydrograph by adding a series of UHs of duration
> *D,* each lagged by time period *D*. This corresponds to the runoff
> hydrograph result- ing from a continuous rainfall excess intensity of
> 1 *D* in./hr, where *D* is measured in hours. Note that an equilibrium
> hydrograph (S-curve) results

> from this addition of many UHs, each lagged by *D* hr (see Fig. 2--3),
> and is equivalent to a continuous rainfall intensity falling until
> inflow and outflow are equal.
>
> By shifting the S-curve in time by *D*\' hr and subtracting ordinates
> between the two S-curves, the resulting hydrograph (Fig. 2--3, curve
> b) must be due to rainfall of 1 *D* in./hr that occurs for *D*\' hr.
> Thus, to con- vert curve b to a UH, we must multiply all the
> hydrograph ordinates by *D D*\' resulting in the UH of duration *D*\'.
> A homework problem explores these calculations in detail. The
> procedure is ideally suited for an Excel spread sheet.
>
> **Unit Hydrograph Convolution**
>
> The real importance of the UH approach is demonstrated in the develop-
> ment of storm hydrographs due to an actual rainfall event over a
> watershed. UH ordinates *U~j~* are multiplied by rainfall excess
> *P~n~* and added and lagged in a sequence to produce a resulting storm
> hydrograph, which ideally can be done using available Excel
> spreadsheets. Hydrograph convolution, the procedure of deriving a
> storm hydrograph from a multiperiod rainfall excess, is illustrated in
> Example 2--2. For actual watersheds, these calcula- tions are almost
> always done in a hydrologic model such as HEC-HMS (see Chapter 5).
>
> Each unit hydrograph is added at the time corresponding to the rain-
> fall spike that produced a response. Base flow can be added to produce
> a
>
> realistic storm hydrograph if base flow values are available for the
> water- shed under study. Care should be taken in this calculation to
> ensure that the time increments of rainfall excess correspond exactly
> to the duration of the UH. For example, 1-hr time increments should be
> used with the 1-hr UH. The governing equation for the storm hydrograph
> in discrete form is called the **convolution equation**:

*n*

> *Q~n~* = a *P~i~U~n~*~-*i*+1~, (2--1)

> *i* = 1

> *Q~n~* = *P~n~U*~1~ + *P~n~*~-1~*U*~2~ + *P~n~*~-2~*U*~3~ + g +
> *P*~1~*U~j~*,
>
> where *Q~n~* is the storm hydrograph ordinate, *P~i~* is rainfall
> excess, and *U~j~* (*j* = *n* - *i* + 1) is the unit hydrograph
> ordinate. Periods of no rainfall can also be included, as shown in
> Example 2--2.

> **STORM HYDROGRAPH FROM THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH**

> Given the rainfall excess hyetograph and the 1-hr UH below, derive the
> storm hydrograph for the watershed using hydrograph convolution (add
> and lag). Compute the resulting storm hydrograph and assume no losses
> to infiltration or evapotranspiration.

>
> The first line of development was based on the rational method modi-
> fied to include the travel time to the outlet for a particular
> watershed. Clark (1945) assumed that watershed response would be given
> by routing the time-- area relationship through an element of linear
> storage (see Eq. 2--23), which tends to attenuate and time-lag the
> hydrograph. The Clark unit hydrograph is contained in HEC-HMS and is
> presented in detail later in this section and in Table 5--10. The
> second approach to UH development assumed mathe- matical
> representations for the shape of the UH. A useful approach was
> advanced by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS, 1964, 1986), based on
> mea- surements from thousands of small watershed areas, which
> represented a dimensionless UH of discharge vs. time by a gamma
> function (discussed later). Since volume is fixed, only one parameter
> is required to determine the entire UH, either the *t~p~* or the peak
> flow rate, *Q~p~*.
>
> In the late 1950s, both approaches began to converge after the impor-
> tant contributions of O'Kelly (1955) and Nash (1958, 1959). O'Kelly's
> work was based on replacing the time--area curve by a UH in the shape
> of an isosceles triangle. Empirical expressions were necessary to
> transform the methods of Clark (1945) into usable UH techniques for
> actual basins. John- stone and Cross (1949) proposed one of the first
> relationships for *t~c~*, the time of concentration in hours, defined
> earlier in the chapter.
>
> *t~c~* = 5.0(*L*\> 1*S*)^0.5^, (2--6)

> and for **storage delay time**, *K*, in hours,

> *K* = 1.5 + 90(*A*\>*LR*), (2--7)
>
> where *L* is the length of the main stream in mi, *A* is the area in
> mi^2^, *S* is the slope in ft/mi, and *R* is an overland slope factor.
>
> Hydrologists have realized that a number of parameters are important
> in determining the shape and timing of the UH for a watershed. The lag
> or time to peak *t~p~* and the time of concentration *t~c~* are often
> used (Fig. 2--1(a)). The time of rise *T~R~* measured from time zero
> to the hydrograph peak is sometimes used. The time base *T~b~* of the
> hydrograph is included to define the duration of direct runoff. These
> timing parameters must be statistically or theoretically related to
> watershed characteristics in developing a syn- thetic UH.
>
> The discharge parameter most often used is the peak discharge *Q~p~*.
> A **routing parameter** *K* is sometimes included when the hydrograph
> has been routed through a linear reservoir with storage delay time
> *K*. This tends to delay and attenuate the input hydrograph. Watershed
> parameters of most concern include area *A*, main channel length *L*,
> length to watershed centroid *L~c~*, and slope of main channel *S*
> (see Section 2.1 and Fig. 1--22).
>
> **Assumptions and Modifying Factors**
>
> Most synthetic UH methods assume that the UH of a basin represents the
> integrated effect of size, slope, shape, and storage characteristics.
> As long as these factors are constant between two basins and do not
> vary with time, the unit response will be identical for the two
> basins. For two basins of the same size, if the slope of one is
> greater or if the basin shape of one is more con- centrated (if the
> length/width ratio is lower), the shape of the hydrograph will shift,
> as shown by the shift from *a* to *b* in Figure 2--5. Storage
> character- istics of the basin relate to slope, soil type, topography,
> channel resistance, and shape. If upstream reservoir storage is
> combined with downstream chan- nelization, the UH may shift to curve
> *b* due to a more rapid rise time from concrete channels and less
> infiltration loss from urban development. Finally, if an elongated
> basin were fully developed, one might expect a shift to curve *c*,
> where time of rise is much shorter and peak flow is much greater than
> in the original UH, *a*. Such a case is shown in Figure 2--6 for a
> fully developed watershed, Brays Bayou in Houston, Texas. Original
> synthetic hydrograph methods generally do not consider urbanization
> effects, but more modern empirical formulas usually account for urban
> channels, percent impervious (paved) area, or percent storm-sewered
> area.

> Time (hr)
>
> Most of the methods for synthetic UHs relate lag time *t~p~* or time
> of rise *T~R~* of the hydrograph to measures of the length of the main
> channel and shape of the basin. Some methods also relate timing to the
> inverse of the slope of the main channel or land. Thus, the longer the
> basin and the smaller the slope, the greater the time of rise of the
> hydrograph, as expected. Fig- ure 1--19(a) (Chapter 1) shows the
> general effect of watershed shape and land use (i.e., elongated vs.
> concentrated) on UH response.
>
> A second relation is usually presented between peak flow *Q~p~* and
> area of basin, and between *Q~p~* and the inverse of the *t~p~* or
> *T~R~* of the hydrograph, thus indicating that larger areas produce
> higher *Q~p~*. From continuity, the higher the peak flow, the smaller
> *t~p~* must be to keep the volume of the unit
>
> hydrograph constant with 1.0 in. of direct runoff. This is easily seen
> by refer- ring to Figure 2--5, where curves *a*, *b*, and *c* are all
> unit hydrographs. The following sections describe a few of the more

> Once the three quantities *t~p~*, *Q~p~*, and *T~b~* are known, the UH

> **Clark UH Method**
>
> The Clark (1945) UH is based on the use of a watershed and is modeled
> as a linear channel in series with a linear reservoir to account for
> translation and attenuation, respectively. This conceptual model
> defines the outflow from the linear channel as inflow (*I~i~*) to the
> linear reservoir, and the outflow
>
> (*O~i~*) from the linear reservoir as the instantaneous unit
> hydrograph (IUH). The linear channel uses an area--time relationship
> (i.e., isochrones of travel time to the outlet of watershed), and it
> is used to estimate the time distribu- tion of runoff from the basin.
> Time of concentration is represented by the time of runoff from the
> most remote part of the basin to the outlet. The linear reservoir
> signifies the combining effects of storage and resistance from the
> basin. Hoggan (1997) described the Clark method in details using the
> concept of the instantaneous unit hydrograph. Derivation starts with
> the relationship between the reservoir outflow and the storage is
> expressed as
>
> *S~i~* = *RO~i~*, (2--23)
>
> where
>
> *S~i~* = storage at end of period *i*, *O~i~* = outflow during period
> *i*, *R* = storage coefficient.

>
> Two major parameters of the Clark unit hydrograph are the time of con-
> centration *T~c~* and the storage coefficient *R*, which is the slope
> of the storage-- outflow curve for the linear reservoir. *T~c~* and
> *R* values can usually be obtained
>
> from observed hydrographs for gaged basins: *T~c~* is estimated as the
> time from the end of a burst rainfall excess to the inflection point
> on the receding limb; *R* is estimated by dividing the direct-runoff
> discharge at the inflection point by the slope of the curve at that
> point. The inflection point means where inflow to the linear reservoir
> is zero. At the inflection point, the continuity equation can be

> *R* = -(*Oi* - *Oi* - 1)\>Δ*t*. (2--29)
>
> Equation (2--29) theoretically produces the value of *R* as the ratio
> between the average discharge at the inflection point and the negative
> slope of the hydrograph at this point (which is negative).
>
> For ungaged basins, *T~c~* is usually determined from an analysis of
> travel time in the basin or from regression relationships that have
> been developed for the region. Even though the storage coefficient
> (*R*) cannot be obtained from measurable watershed characteristics
> directly, many regression equa- tions have been developed from some
> regions. Because *T~c~* and *R* are inter- dependent, the combining
> variables, *T~c~* + *R* and *R* (*T~c~* + *R*) are always used in unit
> hydrograph computations. Thus, the Clark method is now called the TC
> and R method, and is routinely used in HEC-HMS models, as shown in
> Table 5--10.
>
> Once a UH of given duration based on known storms or synthetic methods
> has been developed for a particular basin under a given set of physio-
> graphic conditions, it can then be utilized for a number of hydrologic
> cal- culations (Fig. 2--9). Such hydrographs can be developed for
> almost any area where UH methods have been developed or by applying
> general methods such as SCS's or Snyder's. In particular, for a single
> basin area, the UH can be used with a given storm event to determine
> the storm hydrograph through the add-and-lag procedure. For complex
> watersheds of several subbasins:

1.  Design storm hydrographs for selected recurrence-interval storms
    (10-yr, 25-yr, 100-yr) can be developed through convolution (adding
    and lagging) procedures for a given watershed area (Fig. 2--9(a)).

2.  Effects of land use changes, channel modifications, storage
    additions, and other variables can be tested to determine changes in
    the UH (Fig. 2--9).

3.  Storm hydrographs for each subbasin can be simulated by adding,
    > lagging, and routing the flows produced by unit hydrographs
    > through channel reaches (Chapter 4). Effects of various rainfall
    > pat- terns and land use distributions can be tested on overall
    > hydrologic response of the large watershed (Fig. 2--9(b)), as
    > demonstrated in Example 2--7.

4.  Storage routing methods (Chapter 4) can be used to translate inflow
    > UHs through a reservoir or detention basin of particular size to
    > attenuate peak flow or lag time to the peak of the hydrograph.
    > This is used for analysis of flood control options.

> **HYDROGRAPH CONVOLUTION**
>
> Given UH~1~ and UH~2~ for two subareas of a watershed that meet at
> conflu- ence point *A*; use the 10-yr 6-hr design rainfall for Houston
> (Fig. 1--15) to find the resulting storm hydrograph at the point of
> confluence. Use hydrograph convolution (add and lag). Assume
> infiltration losses are
>
> 0.15 in. for the first hour and 0.1 in./hr thereafter. Estimate the
> area of subarea 1. Figure E2--7 shows the watershed.

**HYDROLOGIC**

> **LOSS--- EVAPORATION**

**AND ET**

> **Introduction to Evaporation**
>
> Evaporation is the process by which water in its liquid or solid state
> is trans- formed into water vapor, which as a gas mixes with the
> atmosphere. Evapo- transpiration (*ET*) is considered separately as
> the combined loss of water vapor from the surface of plants
> (transpiration) and the evaporation of mois- ture from soil. Knowledge
> of evaporation processes is important in predict- ing water losses to
> evaporation from a lake or reservoir. On average, approximately 70% of
> the mean annual rainfall in the United States is returned to the
> atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration. However, vari- ations in
> evaporation across the continent can be very large due to effects of
> solar input, location of mountains, and proximity to oceans. On an
> annual basis, evaporation rates can exceed mean annual rainfall,
> especially in arid regions of the southwest. For example, arid areas
> in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and southern California can
> exceed 70 in. per year, com- pared to about 30 to 40 in. per year for
> much of the rest of the country.
>
> For the case of evaporation from a lake surface, water loss is a
> function of solar radiation, temperature of the water and air,
> difference in vapor pres- sure between water and the overlying air,
> and wind speed across the lake. As evaporation proceeds in a
> closed-container system at a constant tem- perature, pressure in the
> air space increases because of an increase in partial pressure of
> water vapor. Evaporation continues until vapor pressure of the
> overlying air equals the surface vapor pressure; at this point, the
> air space is said to be saturated at that temperature, and further
> evaporation ceases. This state of equilibrium would not be reached if
> the container were open to the atmosphere, in which case all water
> would eventually evaporate. Ther- mal energy is required to increase
> the free energy of water molecules to allow escape across the
> liquid--gas interface. The amount of heat required to convert water to
> vapor at constant temperature (597 cal/g at 0°C) is called the latent
> heat of evaporation, as given in Equation (1--5).
>
> As vaporization continues over a flat free-water surface, an accumula-
> tion of vapor molecules causes an increase in the vapor pressure *e*
> in the air just above the water surface, until eventually condensation
> begins. The air is saturated when the rate of condensation equals the
> rate of vaporization and *e* equals the saturation vapor pressure.
> However, various convective transport processes operate to transport
> the vapor (by wind-driven currents) and prevent equilibrium from
> occurring.
>
> Evaporation is important in the long-term water balance and is usually
> of concern for large-scale water resources planning and water supply
> studies. Dur- ing typical storm periods, with intensities of 0.5
> in./hr, evaporation is on the order of 0.01 in./hr and is normally
> neglected for flood flow studies and urban drainage design
> applications. Evaporation has been extensively studied in the United

> **Water Budget Method for Determining Evaporation**
>
> The water budget method for lake evaporation is based on the
> continuity equation. Assuming that change in storage Δ*S*, surface
> inflow *I*, surface out- flow *O*, subsurface seepage to ground water
> flow *GW*, and precipitation *P* can be measured, evaporation *E* can
> be computed as
>
> *E* = - Δ*S* + *I* + *P* - *O* - *GW*. (2--33)
>
> The approach is simple in theory, but evaluating seepage terms can
> make the method quite difficult to implement. The obvious problems
> result from errors in measuring precipitation, inflow, outflow, change
> in storage, and subsurface seepage. Good estimates using the method
> were obtained for Lake Hefner, near Oklahoma City, with 5% to 10%
> error. It should be emphasized that Lake Hefner was selected from more
> than one hundred lakes and reservoirs as one of three or four that
> best met water budget requirements and had minimal seepage losses to
> the subsurface.
>
> **Mass Transfer Method**
>
> Mass transfer techniques are based primarily on the concept of
> turbulent transfer of water vapor from a water surface to the
> atmosphere. Numerous empirical formulas have been derived to express
> evaporation rate as a function of vapor-pressure differences and wind
> speed above a lake or reservoir. Many such equations can be written in
> the form of a diffusive flux of water vapor, whose concept dates back
> to Dalton's original theories (Brutsaert, 1982):
>
> *E* = (*e~s~* - *e~a~*)(*a* + *bu*), (2--34)
>
> where
>
> *e~s~* = saturation vapor pressure at the *T~s~* of the water surface,
>
> *e~a~* = vapor pressure at some fixed level above the water surface,
> the product of relative humidity times saturation vapor pressure at
> *T~a~* of the air,
>
> = wind speed,
>
> *a*, *b* = empirical constants.
>
> An obstacle to comparing different evaporation formulas is the vari-
> ability in measurement heights for *u* and *e~a~*. Reducing all
> formulas to the same measurement level of 2 m (6.5 ft) for wind speed
> and vapor pressure and taking into account the 30% difference between
> reservoir and pan evap- oration, the scatter between the common
> formulas is considerably reduced. The formula with the best database
> is the Lake Hefner formula given by Marciano and Harbeck (1954), which
> also performed well at Lake Mead (Harbeck, 1958). Some formulas use a
> zero value of the constant *a* in Equa- tion (2--34), due probably to
> small local air movements with velocities insuf- ficient to remove
> excess vapor from above a pan surface. Harbeck and Meyers (1970)
> present the formula

>
> *e*~2~ = vapor pressure 2 m above water surface (mb),
>
> *u*~2~ = wind speed 2 m above the water surface (m/s).
>
> **Energy Budget Method**
>
> The most accurate and complex method for determining evaporation uses
> the energy budget of a lake (Fig. 2--13). The overall energy budget

> refilled when the depth has fallen to 7 in. The water surface level is
> measured daily, and evaporation is computed as the
>
> difference between observed levels, adjusted for any precipitation
> measured in a standard rain gage. Alternatively, water is added each
> day to bring the level up to a fixed point. Pan evaporation rates are
> higher than actual lake evapora- tion and must be adjusted to account
> for radiation and heat-exchange effects. The adjustment factor is
> called the pan coefficient, which ranges from 0.64 to
>
> 0.81 and averages 0.70 for the United States. However, the pan
> coefficient var- ies with season, exposure, and climatic conditions
> and should be used only for rough estimates of lake evaporation. Pan

> **Evapotranspiration**

For a water budget over the whole watershed, one is usually concerned
with the total evaporation from all free-water surfaces, plus
**transpiration**, the loss of vapor through small openings (stomata) in
plant tissue (e.g., leaves). For most plants, transpiration occurs only
during daylight hours during photo- synthesis, which can lead to diurnal
variations in the shallow ground water table in heavily vegetated areas.
The combined evaporation and transpira- tion loss is called
**evapotranspiration (ET)** and is a maximum if the water supply to both
the plant and soil surface is unlimited. The maximum possible loss is
limited by meteorological conditions and is called **potential ET**
(Thornthwaite, 1948); potential ET is approximately equal to the
evapora- tion from a large, free-water surface such as a lake. Thus,
methods discussed in the previous section for evaporation can be used to
predict potential ET. Large surface area and high temperature of leaves
can easily create transpiration rates that equal or even exceed
potential ET. Exceedance is possible in instances of an "oasis" of
well-watered vegetation, such as a crop or golf course, located in a
larger area in which actual ET is less than the potential. Actual
transpiration and, hence, actual ET are usually lim- ited by moisture
supply to the plants. Obviously the effect of limited mois- ture will
depend on plant characteristics such as root depth and the ability of
the soil to transport water to the roots. These effects have led to
various empirical factors that may be applied to potential ET, computed
using one of the evaporation methods discussed previously. For example,
Penman (1950) determined that ET from a vegetated land surface in Great
Britain was 60% to 80% of potential ET computed using his method; Shih
et al. (1983) used a value of 70% for crops in southern Florida. On the
other hand, Priestly and Taylor (1972) multiplied Penman equation
evaporation by 1.26 for well-watered crops to compute ET. Other
empirical formulas

1.  The soil under consideration is homogeneous and stable, implying
    that macropores and preferential migration pathways should not be
    considered.

2.  The supply of ponded water at the surface is not limited (an assump-
    tion subject to modification below).

3.  A distinct and precisely definable wetting front exists, and as
    > water continues to infiltrate, the wetting front advances at the
    > same rate with depth.

4.  The capillary suction just below the wetting front is uniform
    > through- out the profile and constant in time during the
    > infiltration event.

5.  The soil is uniformly saturated above the wetting front, and the
    > vol- umetric water contents remain constant above and below the
    > advanc- ing wetting front.

> At the wetting front, the average capillary suction head c is used to

    Remem- bering that the hydraulic conductivity that transmits water
    downward based on the hydrostatic pressure is accompanied by the
    suction head, c, which pulls water downward into unsaturated soil,
    Equation (2--52) indicates that the infiltration rate is a value
    greater than the saturated hydraulic conductiv- ity as long as there
    is sufficient water at the surface for infiltration, as sketched in
    curves B--C and D of Figure 2--19c. The infiltration rate decreases
    as the cumulative infiltration increases.

> Solution of the Green and Ampt equation requires the estimation of
> three parameters: the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity
> (*K~s~*), the moisture deficit (*M~d~*), and the wetting front suction

> water flow (the porosity minus the thin film of water surrounding all

> Three rainfall-infiltration scenarios are possible:
>
> **Case 1: *i ***\* ***K~s~*.** The rainfall intensity is less than the

> **SNOWFALL AND SNOWMELT**
>
> A small percentage (about 13%) of precipitation over the entire U.S.
> falls as snow, but it can be a dominant source of streamflow,
> especially in mountain- ous areas during spring melt. This is
> certainly true of the western United States, but significant
> percentages of runoff in the northeast and midwest also originate as
> snow. Because the storage and melting of snow play an important role
> in the hydrologic cycle of some areas, hydrologists must be able to
> reliably predict the contribution of snowmelt to overall runoff.
> Because snowmelt begins in the spring and the derived runoff is out of
> phase with periods of greatest water demand, control schemes such as
> storage res- ervoirs have been implemented in many areas for water
> supply. Under cer- tain conditions, snowmelt can also contribute to
> flooding problems, especially in larger river basins with mountainous
> areas. In addition to forecasting flood situations, snowmelt
> predictions are also valuable to power companies that generate
> hydroelectricity and to irrigation districts.
>
> Because of the range of uses for estimating the contribution of snow-
> melt to streamflow and the variation of conditions applicable to each
> case, many methods have been developed for computing snowmelt as it
> affects streamflow. These methods have consistently found that the
> timing and
>
> amount of runoff depend mainly on three factors: the energy of a
> snowpack available for melt, the areal extent of the melting
> snowcover, and the effects of storage on the movement of the meltwater
> (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Snow measurements are obtained using standard and recording rain
> gages, snow stakes, and snow boards, which measure accumulation over a
> period of time. Snow surveys at a number of spaced points along a snow
> course are necessary to account for drifting and blowing snow. The
> Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) uses devices called snow
> pillows, which continuously record and transmit the pressure from snow
> at the bottom of a snowpack. The NRCS has about 500 telemetry sites
> ("SNOTEL" sites) throughout the western United States transmitting
> data from snow pillows.
>
> The distribution of mean annual snowfall in the United States is quite
> variable, and errors may be large in mountainous regions because of
> the lack of measurements in remote areas. There is a gradual increase
> in snowfall with latitude and elevation, and from 400 to 500 in./yr
> (\~1000 cm/yr) can occur in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range of the
> western United States. Large snows
>
> can also occur near the Great Lakes, with average values over 100 in.
> (254 cm).
>
> **Physics of Snowmelt**
>
> The energy exchanged between the snowpack, the atmosphere, and the
> earth's surface is the controlling factor in rates of snowmelt. Other
> geo- graphic, topographic, and surface cover factors are also
> important. Density of snow is a major aspect of predicting runoff and
> is determined by several factors. Snow that is formed under dry, cold
> conditions will be less dense than snow formed under wet and warmer
> conditions. As snow accumulates on the ground over a period of time,
> its density increases with the settling and compaction due to factors
> such as wind. Wind increases the density of snow in two ways: First,
> the turbulence breaks ice crystals into smaller ones, making them
> settle more compactly, and second, drag forces are exerted on the
> surface of snow due to the moving air and particles. Newly fallen snow
> has a density about 10% that of liquid water, but the density can
> increase to 50% with aging. The depth of water that would result if
> all the snow melted is called the **snow water equivalent, SWE**, and
> is given by the equation
>
> SWE = 0.01 *d~s~*r*~s~*, (2--55)
>
> where SWE is in mm, snowdepth *d~s~* is in cm, and r*~s~* is in
> kg/m^3^. The density of snow is often assumed to be 100 kg/m^3^. Hence
> a rule of thumb for new snow is that the depth of water equivalent is
> approximately 1/10 the depth of the snowpack. *Ripe snow* holds all
> the liquid water it can against the action of gravity. If a snowpack
> is ripe, additional rain can not only result in runoff itself but also
> warm the snow due to the release of the latent heat when the rain
> fuses with the pack (Male and Gray, 1981). Hence, any heat added to
> ripe snow will produce runoff. Heat added to a snowpack at a
> temperature below freezing will act to warm it.
>
> Snowmelt and evaporation are both thermodynamic processes and can be
> studied with an energy-balance approach. The energy for snowmelt is
> derived from the following: (1) net solar radiation, (2) net longwave
> radia- tion exchange (from atmosphere and clouds), (3) conduction
> (diffusion) and convection transfer of sensible heat to or from the
> overlying air, (4) conden- sation of water vapor from the overlying
> air, (5) conduction from the under- lying soil, and (6) heat supply by
> incident rainfall. The heat exchange at the snow--air interface
> dominates the snowmelt process, and heat exchange with the soil is
> secondarily important.
>
> For each gram of water melted in a snowpack at 0°C (32°F), 80 cal/g of
> latent heat must be supplied. Thus, if the density of water is 1 g/cm,
> 80 cal will melt 80 cm^3^ (water equivalent) of snow. Hence, 80 ly
> (cal/cm^2^) are required to melt 1 cm depth of snow. Meltwater may
> refreeze with cooling, or it may drain from the snowpack, contributing
> to soil moisture, streamflow, or ground water recharge. Snowmelt
> computations are made difficult by the variations in solar radiation
> received by the surface and variations in the **albedo**, the
> reflection coefficient equal to the ratio of reflected to incident
> shortwave radiation.
>
> Although only 5% to 10% of incoming shortwave radiation is reflected
> by a water surface, up to 83% is reflected by a clean, dry snow
> surface. As the snow ages, its albedo can drop to less than 50%
> because of structural changes, and shortwave radiation penetrates to
> varying depths, depending on snow density. New precipitation affects
> the albedo of a snowpack: A snowfall increases the albedo to 0.8 and
> rain reduces it to 0.4 (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Snow radiates essentially as a black body (emissivity = 0.97)
> according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and outgoing longwave radiation
> at 0°C is equivalent to 8.4 cm (3.3 in.) of melt over a one-day
> period. Because of re- radiation from the atmosphere back to the
> earth, longwave radiation loss is equivalent to only about 2 cm (0.8
> in.) of melt per day under clear skies and near-freezing temperatures.
>
> Heat exchange between a snowpack and the atmosphere is affected by
> conduction, convection, condensation, and evaporation (Anderson, 1976;
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1956). However, very little evaporation
> from snow occurs. Direct transformation of snow (ice) to vapor, known
> as *sublimation,* is an important part of the water balance in the
> Arctic. Wind velocity and air temperature are primary factors
> affecting the density of new snow. The rate of transfer of sensible
> heat (convection) is proportional to the temperature difference
> between the air *T~a~* and the snow *T~s~* and to the wind velocity
> *v.* Condensation melt is proportional to the vapor-pressure
> difference between the snow surface and the atmosphere and to the wind
> velocity. The transfer of heat from the underlying soil to the
> snowpack is small on a daily basis but may accumulate to several
> centimeters of melt during an entire season. This may be enough to
> keep the soil saturated and to produce a rapid response of runoff when
> melting occurs. Raindrop temperature is reduced as it enters a
> snowpack, and an equivalent amount of heat is imparted to the snow
> based on the surface wet-bulb temperature. For example, the heat
> available in 10 mm of rain at 10°C will melt about 1.2 mm of water
> from the snowpack.
>
> In many basins of very high relief, the lower limit of snowcover (the
> snow line) is dynamic and moves up and down the slope. As melting pro-
> ceeds, snowcover recedes more rapidly on southerly and barren slopes,
> with the rate of snowmelt decreasing with elevation. Given the
> temperature at an index station, an area--elevation curve for the
> basin, and the average snow- line elevation, one can compute the area
> subject to melting based on the rate of change of temperature with
> elevation, typically about 1°C per 100 m (5°F per 1000 ft) increase in
> elevation.
>
> **The Snowpack Energy Budget**
>
> The snowpack energy budget is written in terms of the energy flux to
> and from the snowpack, with units of energy per unit area per unit
> time. The most convenient units for *Q* are cal/cm^2^-day (ly/day). In
> terms of the energy budget components mentioned earlier,

Δ*H*\>Δ*t* = *Q~N~* + *Q~g~* + *Q~c~* + *Q~e~* + *Q~p~*, (2--56)

> where
>
> Δ*H* = change in heat storage in snowpack,
>
> *Q~N~* = net (incoming minus reflected minus outgoing) shortwave and
> longwave radiation,
>
> *Q~g~* = conduction of heat to snowpack from underlying ground,
>
> *Q~c~* = convective transport of sensible heat from air to snowpack
> (negative if from snowpack to air),
>
> *Q~e~* = release of latent heat of vaporization by condensation of
> water vapor onto snowpack,
>
> *Q~p~* = advection of heat to snowpack by rain.
>
> If the change in storage is positive, it will act either to warm the
> snow, or to ripen the snow, or to produce melt. These are the three
> phases of snow melt, though they do not always occur in clear, steady
> sequence (Dingman, 2002). Detailed computation of net shortwave and
> longwave radiation is discussed in detail in Gray and Prowse, (1993).
> Convective heat transport and con- densation melt are both diffusive
> processes; the heat flux is proportional to the gradient of
> temperature for the former and to the gradient of vapor pressure for
> the latter. Diffusivities or transfer coefficients are functions of
> wind velocity and surface roughness. Heat transfer to or from the
> ground *Q~g~* is usually neglected unless the snowpack and ground
> surface tempera- tures are both known. Heat advected by rain into the
> snowpack is simply proportional to the difference between the rain
> temperature (usually as- sumed equal to the wet-bulb temperature) and
> the temperature of the snow.
>
> Using a given time duration and the sum of energy budget components in
> ly/day (*Q*~1~ + *Q*~2~ + *Q*~3~ + g), missing variables such as water
> output can be found from equations for heat storage change (Δ*H*) (see
> Dingman, 2002, for examples). The equations for each phase of snowpack
> development (warming, ripening, and melting) are similar to those of
> simple melting ice.

> *h~s~* is the depth of the snow, and *L* is the latent heat of fusion

>
> **Degree-Day or Temperature-Index Melt Equations**
>
> Degree-day or temperature-index equations are empirical or can result
> from a linearization of the energy budget equation (Huber and
> Dickinson, 1988). The simplest equation used is
>
> *M* = *D~f~* (*T~i~* - *T~B~*), (2--61)

> *M* = daily melt as a depth of water equivalent (in./day; mm/day),
>
> *T~i~* = index air temperature (°F; °C),
>
> *T~B~* = base melt temperature (°F; °C),
>
> *D~f~* = degree-day melt factor, (in./day-°F; mm/day-°C).
>
> Empirical degree-day factors range from 0.05 to 0.15 in./day-°F and
> can be determined by several equations, one of the simplest being
>
> *D~f~* = 0.011r*~s~*, (2--62)
>
> where *D~f~* is in units of mm/day-°C above 0°C and r*~s~* is the snow
> density in kg/ m^3^. This factor is affected by location, time of
> year, and meteorological condi- tions, and more complex equations may
> take into account vegetation transmis- sion for radiation, solar
> radiation, and snow albedo (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Equation (2--61) is basically a regression equation; ACOE (1956)
> results are shown in Figure 2--20. Either the maximum or average daily
> tem- perature for the portion over 0°C is usually used for the index
> air tempera- ture *T~i~*, and 0°C is most commonly used for *T~B~*
> (Gray and Prowse, 1993). However, base melt temperatures can be below
> freezing, since Equation (2--62) represents a linearization about

> variables of the energy-balance and temper- ature-index models
> (Dingman, 2002). The final results show good accuracy for both models,
> although some years favored one over the other. During the melting
> phase, Anderson closely matched both snow--water equivalent (SWE) over
> time and daily water output with lysimeter and visual observation
> data. Although both models worked well, each requires detailed
> knowledge of the local environment and changes in conditions. The

> **Computation of Runoff from Snowmelt**
>
> Synthesis of runoff hydrographs associated with snowmelt can be short
> term, for a few days, or long term, for a complete melt season.
> Short-term forecast- ing is used in preparing operational plans for
> reservoirs or other flood con- trol works and for calculating design
> floods. To forecast a few days in advance, only the present condition
> of a snowpack and stream flow are required. Programs used to predict
> runoff from snowmelt include the ACOE Streamflow Synthesis and
> Reservoir Regulation (SSARR) and the U.S. NWS River Forecasting
> System, Snow Accumulation and Ablation Model. For long-term
> forecasting over a whole season, initial conditions are required as
> well as reliable predictions of meteorologic parameters.
>
> Snowmelt occurs only from those portions of a watershed covered by
> snow, and elevation is significant, since rates of snowmelt generally
> decrease with higher elevation due to a general reduction in
> temperature. Elevation effects can be considered by dividing a basin
> into a series of elevation zones, where the snow depth, losses, and
> snowmelt are assumed uniform in each. In most practical cases,
> snowmelt is estimated by the index methods presented in the previous
> section. The budget method itself is used in design flood studies.
> Once inflow water has been calculated, storage routing techniques are
> used to accommodate surface and ground water components, each with a
> different storage time and number of routing units. Storage routing
> methods are treated in detail in Chapter 4.
>
> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 2 presents the concept of rainfall--runoff analysis, or the
> conversion of pre- cipitation to runoff or streamflow, a central
> problem of engineering hydrology. Gross rainfall must be adjusted for
> losses to infiltration, evaporation, and depression stor- age to
> obtain rainfall excess, which equals direct runoff (DRO).
>
> The UH is defined as 1 in. (1 mm) of direct runoff generated uniformly
> over a basin for a specified period of rainfall and is a powerful
> method still used for many watershed studies. The concept of the UH
> allows for the conversion of rainfall ex- cess into a basin
> hydrograph, through a linear adding and lagging procedure called
> hydrograph convolution.
>
> UHs can be derived from actual storm data for gauged basins. Synthetic
> UHs represent theoretical or empirical approaches that can be applied
> to ungaged basins. These are most often used for the analysis of
> watersheds where limited gauging might exist. Most synthetic UH
> formulas relate parameters such as time to peak or lag time to
> measures of channel length, slope, watershed size, and watershed
> shape. A second rela- tion usually correlates peak flow to basin area
> and lag time. UHs are greatly affected by urban development and
> channelization, and UH techniques have been customized for local or
> regional conditions using statistical methods (Chapter 3). Several of
> the more popular UH methods are presented with examples, including
> Snyder, SCS, and Clark (TC & R), all contained within the HEC-HMS
> computer model (Chapter 5).
>
> Kinematic wave methods developed in the 1970s for overland flow hydro-
> graphs and channel hydrographs were based on solutions of the
> continuity and Man- ning's equation for a given geometry. Kinematic
> wave methods are now more useful with the current popularity of
> numerical methods and advanced hydrologic models, which include
> HEC-HMS from the U.S. ACOE Hydrologic Engineering Center (2006, 2010)
> and distributed hydrologic models (Vieux, 2002).
>
> Hydrologic losses are covered in detail in Chapter 2, including
> evaporation and ET for water bodies and vegetated surfaces. The Penman
> equation is presented along with a detailed example of its use.
> Infiltration loss is presented using both simple empiri- cal methods
> such as Horton and more physics-based methods such as Green and Ampt.
> Several examples and homework problems are included to cover these
> methods in detail. Chapter 2 also presents snowfall and snowmelt
> theory as it relates to the rain- fall--runoff process. The physics of
> snowmelt is briefly covered, and energy budget and empirical
> degree-day equations are shown that can be used to estimate melt rates
> in in./day or cm/day as a function of air temperature, snow
> temperature, and other fac- tors. Snowmelt can be a significant factor

> **CONCEPT CHECK**

1.  What characterizes a watershed?

2.  Describe the four assumptions made that are inherent to the unit
    hydrograph.

3.  What physical factors affect the shape and timing of the unit
    hydrograph?

4.  Discuss the parameters that describe the main timing aspects of the
    hydrograph.

5.  What two characteristics of the hydrograph do most methods for the
    synthetic unit hydrographs relate?

6.  In order to determine which of the three excavation sites could have
    potentially contributed to the sedimentation of the three lakes, it
    is necessary to determine the watershed boundaries and the
    contributing drainage areas of the system of lakes. Catchment basins
    (watersheds) can be determined by connecting ridge lines and
    dividing lines. Ridge lines will follow the elevation isocontours,
    and dividing lines are perpendicular to the elevation isocontours at
    the end and start at the confluences of streams. Using the map on
    the textbook website displaying the elevation data, determine the
    following:

    a.  How many confluences are displayed on the map?

    b.  Delineate the watersheds using the elevation isocontours. The
        total drainage area of the study area is approximately 238
        acres.

    c.  Determine which of the three lakes may be affected by
        accelerated sedimentation.

    d.  Determine which of the three excavation sites may be responsible
        for the accelerated sedimentation of the lakes.

7.  A watershed has the following characteristics:

> *A* = 2600 ac
>
> *L* = 5 mi.
>
> *S* = 53 ft/mi.
>
> *y* = 40%
>
> The channel is lined with concrete.
>
> The watershed is a residential area with 1/4-ac lots. The soil is
> categorized as soil group B. Assume that the average watershed slope
> is the same as the chan- nel slope. Determine the UH for this area for
> a storm duration of 1 hr using the SCS triangular UH method.

8.  Determine the storm hydrograph resulting from the rainfall pattern
    in Figure P2--8a using the triangular 1-hr UH given in Figure
    P2--8b.

a.  Using storm hydrograph, estimate the vol of runoff in inches over
    the watershed.

b.  Estimate the vol of infiltration (in.).

c.  Estimate tp for the entire event.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
12. Plot the hydrograph for the storm data given in Problem 1.22 (flow
    > rate vs. time). Label the following:

    a.  peak flow *Q~p~*,

    b.  time to peak *t~p~* (distance from the center of mass of
        > rainfall to the peak flow),

    c.  time of rise *T~R~* (distance from the start of discharge to the
        > peak flow),

    d.  time base *T~B~* (distance from the start of discharge to the
        > end of discharge).

13. Using the convolution equation, develop a storm hydrograph for the
    > rainfall intensity *i* and infiltration *f* given in the table (at
    > the end of each time step) using the 30-min unit hydrograph U
    > given below.

> Unit hydrograph for Subbasin C.

20. Redo Example 2--6 if the watershed is soil type B in good cover
    forest land. How does the forested area compare to the meadow UH?

21. Sketch the SCS triangular and curvilinear UHs and the mass curve for
    a 100-mi^2^ watershed which is 60% good condition meadow and 40%
    good cover forest land. The watershed consists of 70% soil group C
    and 30% soil group A. The average slope is 100 ft/mi, the rainfall
    duration is 3 hr, and the length to divide is 18 mi.

22. A small watershed has the characteristics given below. Find the peak
    discharge *Q~p~*, the basin lag time *t~p~*, and the time base of
    the unit hydrograph *T~b~*~,~ using Snyder's method.

> A = 200 mi.^2^; *C~t~* = 1.70; L = 27 mi.; L*~c~* = 15 mi.; C*~p~* =
> 0.7

23. For a 55 mi^2^ watershed with *C~t~* = 2.2, L = 15 mi., *L~c~* = 7
    mi., and *C~p~* = 0.5, find

> *t~p~*, *Q~p~*, *T~b~*, and D. Plot the resulting Snyder UH.

24. Watershed data are provided on Figure 1--22 for a small forested
    watershed that contains seven subareas as shown. Compute an SCS UH
    (dimensionless) for subarea B, based on lengths and areas from the
    watershed. Assume a wa- tershed slope of 0.5% and a CN = 70.

25. Assume the watershed in Example 2--5 has gone through extensive
    commercial and industrial growth on the wooded area. Now 50% of the
    formerly wooded areas have become urbanized, so of that portion, 40%
    is commercial and busi- ness and 60% is fair condition lawn space.
    Assume the soil is 50% group B and 50% group C for all areas. Using
    Figure 2--8, determine the runoff volume for a rainfall of 6 in.

26. Make sure that the unit hydrograph for subbasin C is a unit
    hydrograph (sub- basin C area = 770 ac). The unit hydrograph for
    subbasin C is graphed in Figure P2--27.

28. Using Figure 2--14, find the daily evaporation from a shallow lake
    > with the following characteristics:

> Mean daily temperature = 25.6°C, Daily solar radiation = 550
> cal/cm^2^,
>
> Mean daily dew point = 4.4°C,
>
> Wind movement (6 in. above pan) = 5.5 ft/s.

29. A class A pan is maintained near a small lake to determine daily
    evaporation (see table). The level in the pan is observed at the end
    of everyday. Water is added if the level falls *near* 7 in. For each
    day the difference in height level is calculated between the current
    and previous day, and the precipitation value is from the current
    day. Determine the daily lake evaporation if the pan coefficient is
    0.70.

30. Given an initial rate of infiltration equal to 1.5 in./hr and a
    final capacity of 0.5 in./hr, use Horton's equation \[Eq. (2--42)\]
    to find the infiltration capacity at the following times: *t* = 10
    min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 6 hr. You may assume a
    time constant *k* = 0.25/hr.

32. A 5-hr storm over a 15-ac basin produces a 5-in. rainfall: 1.2
    in./hr for the first hour, 2.1 in./hr for the second hour, 0.9
    in./hr for the third hour, and 0.4 in./hr for the last 2 hr.

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> **Scope of the Chapter**
>
> Many processes in hydrology must be analyzed and explained in a
> probabi- listic sense because of their inherent randomness. For
> instance, it is not pos- sible to predict streamflow and rainfall on a
> purely deterministic basis in either the past (hindcasting) or the
> future (forecasting), since it is impossible to know all their causal
> mechanisms quantitatively. Fortunately, statistical methods are
> available to organize, present, and reduce observed data to a form
> that facilitates their interpretation and evaluation. This chapter
> pres- ents methods by which the uncertainty in hydrologic data may be
> quantified and presented in a standard probabilistic framework. The
> primary objective is to relate the magnitude of a hydrologic event,
> such as a flood, to its prob- ability and vice versa. Within this
> chapter, the word "flood" is used generi- cally to mean the magnitude
> of a hydrologic event. Although actual flood data are used in
> examples, the same techniques may be applied to precipita- tion and
> many other hydrologic variables.
>
> **174**
>
> **Random Variables**
>
> A random variable is a parameter (e.g., streamflow, rainfall, stage)
> that can- not be predicted with certainty; that is, a random variable
> is the outcome of a random or uncertain process. Such variables may be
> treated statistically as either **discrete** or **continuous**. Most
> hydrologic data are continuous and are analyzed probabilistically
> using continuous frequency distributions. For example, values of flow
> in the hydrograph sketched in Figure 3--1(a) can equal any positive
> real number to the accuracy of the flow meter; that is, the data are
> continuous. However, the data themselves are often presented in a
> discrete form because of the measurement process. For example, daily
> streamflows might be estimated to the nearest cfs. This form of data
> presen- tation is called **quantized continuous**; that is, the
> continuous observations are assigned to discrete ranges. This is also
> illustrated in Figure 3--1(a), in which flows are assigned to the
> nearest cfs.
>
> Discrete random variables can take on values only from a specified
> domain of discrete values. For example, flipping a coin will produce
> either a head or a tail; rolling a die produces an integer from 1 to
> 6. The output from a tipping-bucket rain gage is a hydrologic example
> (Fig. 3--1(b)): There either is

> or is not a tip during any time interval. Quantized-continuous data
> could be treated as discrete; indeed, they are discretized whenever
> tabulated data are processed, since numerical values must be truncated
> (e.g., to the gage accuracy for flow or to the nearest 0.01 in. for
> rainfall). However, for frequency analysis this is usually very
> inconvenient because of the enormous range of values that would have
> to be considered. For example, if streamflows are measured to the
> nearest cfs and there is a range of flows from 0 to 5000 cfs, then
> 5000 discrete intervals would have to be considered. Approximating the
> record as continuous is much easier. Although discrete frequency
> distributions are sometimes applied to continuous variables (e.g.,
> storm rainfall depths), most applications of discrete distributions in
> hydrology are to a random variable that represents the *number* of
> events satisfying a certain criterion---for example, the number of
> floods expected to exceed a certain magnitude during a period of
> years.
>
> **Presentation of Data**
>
> A key assumption of frequency analysis is that the data are
> **independent**; that is, the magnitude of a future event does not
> depend upon the magnitude of past events. While underlying
> climatological mechanisms in hydrology, such as the El Niño--Southern
> Oscillation (ENSO), may affect long-term flow records, climatological
> cause-and-effect mechanisms are difficult to quantify (Tootle et al.,
> 2005). A qualitative judgment regarding the presence of a nonrandom
> pattern in the time series of hydrologic data can often be made on the
> basis of a plot of the time series (a time series is a record of
> magnitude vs. the time at which it occurs). For instance, a 75-yr
> record of the Siletz River near the western Oregon coast is shown in
> Figure 3--2. A 5-yr running average (the average of the given year and
> the four preceding years) is also shown, as

> visual indicators of flow changes that might indicate changes in the

> chosen for this exam- ple largely because its watershed is relatively

> **nonstationarity** in the time series are illustrated in Figure 3--3.
> The statistical descriptors of the data (e.g., mean, variance) change
> in Figure 3--3(a) due to a linear trend---for example, due to
> urbaniza- tion or other development that increases runoff. Long-term
> cyclic trends are shown in Figure 3--3(b), perhaps due to
> climatological changes. The variance of the flows is reduced around
> 1970 in Figure 3--3(c), perhaps due to construc- tion of a dam
> upstream of the gage. Finally, the average flow decreases around 1970
> in Figure 3--3(d), perhaps due to upstream diversions. Formal methods
> for evaluating such changes or trends in time series are discussed by
> Priestly (1981), Helsel and Hirsch (1992), Salas (1993), and Chatfield
> (2003).

> presence of two or more causative mechanisms for the time series data.

> To aid in the selection of a fitted frequency distribution, quantized-
> continuous data are often presented in the form of a *bar chart,* or
> **histogram**. The height and general shape of the histogram are
> useful for characterizing the data and lend insight into the selection
> of a frequency distribution to be applied---for example, whether or
> not the distribution should be symmetric or skewed. Using streamflows
> as an example, the range of flows is first divided into **class
> intervals**, and the number of observations (**frequency**)
> corresponding to each class interval is tabulated. The width of the
> class inter- vals should be small enough so that the underlying
> pattern of the data may be seen but large enough so that such a
> pattern does not become confusing. The value used for the class
> interval can alter the viewer's impression of the data (Benjamin and
> Cornell, 1970); this value may conveniently be altered in many
> computer plotting programs so that the engineer can compare many
> different options. As an aid, Panofsky and Brier (1968) suggest
>
> *k* = 5 log~10~ *n*, (3--1)
>
> where *k* is the number of class intervals and *n* is the number of
> data values. Class intervals do not have to be of constant width if it
> is more convenient to group some data into a larger, aggregated
> interval.
>
> If the ordinates of the histogram are divided by the total number of
> observations, **relative frequencies** (probabilities) of each class
> interval result, such that the ordinates sum to 1.0, providing an
> alternative method of plot- ting the data. Still a third way is in the
> form of a **cumulative frequency dis- tribution**, which represents a
> summation of the histogram relative frequencies up to a given interval
> and is the probability that a value along the abscissa is less than or
> equal to the magnitude at that point. Both relative frequencies and
> cumulative frequencies are extensively used in hydrology and are best
> illustrated by an example.

> **PROBABILITY CONCEPTS**
>
> Consider an experiment with *N* possible outcomes, *X*~1~, *X*~2~, . .
> . , *X~i~*, . . . , *X~N~*. The outcomes are **mutually exclusive** if
> no two of them can occur simultane- ously. They are **collectively
> exhaustive** if they account for all possible out- comes of the
> experiment. The **probability** of an event *X~i~* may be defined as
>
> the relative number of occurrences of the event after a very large
> number of trials. This probability may be estimated as *P*(*X~i~*) =
> *n~i~ n*, where *n~i~* is the number of occurrences (frequency) of
> event *X~i~* in *n* trials. Thus, *n~i~ n* is the relative frequency
> or probability of occurrence of *X~i~*. (See Fig. 3--4.)
>
> A **discrete probability** is simply the probability of a discrete
> event. If one defines *P*(*X~i~*) as the probability of the random
> event *X~i~*, the following conditions hold on the discrete
> probabilities of these events when considered over the sample space of
> *N* possible outcomes:
>
> 0 ≤ *P*(*X~i~*) ≤ 1, (3--2)

*N*

> a *P*(*X~i~*) = 1. (3--3)
>
> *i* = 1
>
> The probability of the **union** (occurrence of either, symbolized by
> U) of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of
> each:

*P*(*X*~1~ U *X*~2~) = *P*(*X*~1~) + *P*(*X*~2~). (3--4)

> Two events *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~ are **independent** if the occurrence of
> one does not influence the occurrence of the other. The probability of
> the **intersection** (occurrence of both, symbolized by ∩) of two
> independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ U *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~). (3--5)
>
> For events that are neither independent nor mutually exclusive,

*P*(*X*~1~ U *X*~2~) = *P*(*X*~1~) + *P*(*Y*~1~) - *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~).
(3--6)

> The conditional probability of event *X*~1~ given that event *Y*~1~
> has occurred is
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ \| *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~)\>*P*(*Y*~1~). (3--7)
>
> If events *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~ are independent, then Equations (3--5) and

*P*(*X*~1~ \| *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~)\>*P*(*Y*~1~) =
*P*(*X*~1~). (3--8)

>
> **CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES**
>
> Let event *Y*~1~ be the condition that a rainstorm occurs on a given
> day and event *X*~1~ be the condition that lightning is observed on a
> given day.
>
> Let probabilities of these events be

>
> *P*(*Y*~1~) = 0.1 (Probability of rain = 10%)

> *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~) = *P*(*Y*~1~ \| *X*~1~) . *P*(*X*~1~) = 0.15.

> **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**
>
> The behavior of a random variable may be described by its probability
> dis- tribution. Every possible outcome of an experiment is assigned a
> numerical value according to a discrete **probability mass function**
> (PMF) or a continuous **probability density function (PDF)**. In
> hydrology, discrete random variables are most commonly used to
> describe the *number* of occurrences that satisfy a certain criterion,
> such as the number of floods that exceed a specified value or the
> number of storms that occur at a given location. Examples later in
> this chapter will be of this type. As a rule, discrete random
> variables are associ- ated with parameters that can assume only
> integer values. However, it is possible to round continuous variables
> to the nearest integer or to rescale to integers. For example, 2.18
> in. of rain is 218 hundredths of an inch of rain.
>
> Occasionally, it is convenient to treat a continuous variable in a
> dis- crete sense, as for the flows described in Figure 3--4. Let the
> notation *P*(*x*~1~)
>
> mean the probability that the random variable *X* takes on the value
> *x*~1~ { Δ*x*.
>
> From Figure 3--4, Δ*x* = 2500 cfs, or half of the class interval. Thus
> letting *X*
>
> represent "discrete" streamflows, we can assign relative frequencies
> from Figure 3--4:

*P*(7500) = 0.013, *P*(27,500) = 0.093,

*P*(12,500) = 0.173, *P*(32,500) = 0.080,

> *P*(17,500) = 0.360, *P*(37,500) = 0.000,
>
> *P*(22,500) = 0.267, *P*(42,500) = 0.013.
>
> Note that these values satisfy the probability axioms of Equations
> (3--2) and (3--3). Furthermore, for discrete probabilities,
>
> *P*(*a* ≤ *x* ≤ *b*) = a *P*(*x~i~*). (3--9)
>
> *a* ≤ *x~i~* ≤ *b*
>
> The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) is defined as

> *F*(*x*) = *P*(*X* ≤ *x*) = a *P*(*x~i~*). (3--10)

> The most common means used in hydrology to indicate the probability of
> an event is to assign a **return period**, or **recurrence interval**,
> to the event. The return period is defined as follows:
>
> An annual maximum event has a return period (or recurrence interval)
> of *T* years if its magnitude is equaled or exceeded once, *on the
> average*, every *T* years. The reciprocal of *T* is the exceed- ance
> probability, 1 - *F*, of the event---that is, the probability that the
> event is equaled or exceeded in any one year.
>
> Thus, the 50-yr flood has a probability of 0.02, or 2%, of being
> equaled or exceeded in any single year. It is imperative to realize
> that the return period implies nothing about the actual time sequence
> of an event. The 50-yr flood does not occur like clockwork once every
> 50 yr. Rather, one expects that on the average, about twenty 50-yr
> floods will be experienced during a 1000-yr period. There could in
> fact be two 50-yr floods in a row (with probability

2.  \* 0.02 = 0.0004 for independent events). For this reason, labeling
    a 50-yr flood as a "2% flood" is often a clearer indication to the
    public as to its true likelihood of occurrence in any one year.

> The concept of a return period implies independent events and is usu-

>
> A further option is to use all the data in the historic time series,
> whether or not they are independent. This is called the **complete
> series**; an example is the series of 365 daily average streamflows.
> Note that the maximum daily average streamflow is not necessarily the
> maximum flow for the day, since the U.S. Geological Survey records
> hourly or 15-min values and determines the maximum flow as the highest
> recorded value and the daily average as the average of the 24 or 96
> recorded values. Frequency information derived from such a complete
> series is usually shown in a **flow-duration curve** (Searcy, 1959),
> which is a plot of magnitude vs. percentage of time the mag- nitude is
> equaled or exceeded (Fig. 3--12). The information from such an
> analysis cannot be directly related to return period, since the values

> discrete distribution considered in this text; it is very commonly
> used in hydrology.

> **EXAMPLE 3--7**
>
> **CRITICAL FLOOD DESIGN**
>
> Consider the 50-yr flood 1*p* = 0.022.

a.  What is the probability that at least one 50-yr flood will occur
    during the 30-yr lifetime of a flood control project? This is just
    the risk of failure discussed above, and the distribution of the
    number of failures is *B*(30, 0.02). Thus, from Equation (3--51),

> Risk = 1 - (1.0 - 0.02)^30^
>
> = 1 - 0.98^30^
>
> = 1 - 0.545
>
> = 0.455.
>
> If this risk is too great, the engineer might design for the 100-yr
> event for which the risk is
>
> Risk = 1 - 0.99^30^ = 0.26
>
> and the reliability is 0.74. For this latter circumstance, there is a
> 26% chance of occurrence of the 100-yr event over the 30-yr life- time
> of the project.
>
> When it is not possible to reduce the risk to a desired level by
> designing for a high (but hypothetical) return period event, an
> alternative is to design for the **probable maximum flood**, which is
> the flood that results from the **probable maximum precipitation
> (PMP)** event. The PMP is the highest precipitation likely to occur
> under known meteorological conditions (Smith, 1993; Mays, 2001)
>
> and has been computed for most areas of the United States by the
> National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center
> ([http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/studies/pmp.html).](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/studies/pmp.html))

b.  What is the probability that the 100-yr flood will not occur in 10
    yr? In 100 yr?

For *n* = 10, *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - *P*)^10^ = 0.99^10^ = 0.904,

For *n* = 100, *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - *p*)^100^ = 0.99^100^ = 0.37.

> Thus, there is a 37% chance (37% reliability) that the 100-yr flood
> will not occur during a sequence of 100 yr.

c.  In general, what is the probability of having no floods greater than
    the *T*-yr flood during a sequence of *T* yr?

> *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - 1\>*T*)*^T^*.

As *T* gets large, this approaches 1\>*e* (Benjamin and Cornell, 1970,

> p\. 234). Thus for large *T*,
>
> *P*(*x* = 0) ≈ *e*^-1^ = 0.368 (the reliability)

and

> *P*(*x* ≥ 0) ≈ 1 - *e*^-1^ = 0.632 (the risk).
>
> As an approximation, the *T*-yr flood will occur within a *T*-yr
> period with approximately a 2 3 probability.
>
> **The Exponential Distribution**
>

    storms?

> Prob(*t* ≥ 96) = 1 - *F*(96) = *e*^-0.0135^.96 = 0.27.

b.  What is the probability that the separation between two storms will

Prob(*t* = 12) = 0,

c.  What is the probability that the separation between two storms will
    be less than or equal to 12 hr?

Prob(*t* ≤ 12) = *F*(12) = 1 - *e*^-0.0135^.12 = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

> distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution (Benjamin and
> Cornell, 1970). Many physical processes can be conceptualized as the

> **The Lognormal Distribution**
>
> Consider a hypothetical runoff calculation, in which runoff is equal
> to the *product* of functions of several random factors, such as
> rainfall, contributing area, loss coefficient, and evaporation. In
> general, if a random variable *x* results from the product of a large
> number of other random variables (i.e., a "multiplicative mechanism"),
> then the distribution of the logarithm of *x* will approach normality,
> since the logarithm of *x* will consist of the sum of the logs of the
> contributing factors. In hydrology, it is easy to conceive of many
> contributing factors to runoff that are inherently random and about
> which there is very little deterministic information. Hence, a
> multiplicative mechanism for runoff may be a very reasonable
> assumption. In general, a random variable has a **lognormal**
> distribution if the log of the random vari- able is distributed
> normally. For example, if *y* = log *x* and if *y* is distributed
> normally, then *x* is distributed lognormally.
>
> The lognormal PDF is sketched in Figure 3--15. Because it is bounded
> on the left by zero, has a positive skewness, and is easily used
> through its relationship to the normal, it is widely applied in
> hydrology. The skewness is a function of the coefficient of variation:
>
> *g* = 3*CV* + *CV*^3^. (3--60)
>
> The skewness of the transformed variable *y* is, of course, zero,
> since *y* is distributed normally.
>
> Although the PDF of *x* (the untransformed variable) can easily be
> derived (Benjamin and Cornell, 1970), it is seldom needed. Instead,
> the moments of *y* = log *x* (either base 10 or natural logs may be
> used) are found, and the normal distribution is used for *y*. This may
> be done in two ways. The method of moments requires that the moments

> **APPLICATION OF LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION TO FLOOD FLOWS**
>
> Repeat Example 3--10 using the lognormal distribution. Parameters of
> the logs (base 10) were calculated in Example 3--3.

(a) What is the 100-yr flood?

> The *z* value was found in Example 3--10 to be 2.326. Thus,
>
> *y*~100~ = 4.29209 + 2.326 . 0.12905 = 4.5923
>
> **EXAMPLE 3--11**

and

> *Q*~100~ = 10*^y^*100 = 39,100 cfs.
>
> This value is much higher than the estimate (34,620 cfs) from the
> normal distribution. But it is a better estimate because the lognor-
> mal distribution more accurately reflects the skewness of the actual
> flow data. (Note that it is a good practice to carry several
> significant figures when working with logarithms, and round only for
> the final answer.)

(b) What is the probability that a flow will be less than or equal to
    30,000 cfs?

> The value of *y* = log~10~ 30,000 = 4.4771.
>
> *z* [4.4771 - 4.2921]{.underline} 1.4337.
>
> 0.12905
>
> Interpolating linearly in Table D--1, *F* 11.43372 = 0.9242. The
> return period of a 30,000-cfs flood is thus 1\> 11 - 0.92422 = 13.1
> yr.

(c) How do the moment estimates from the log-transformed data com- pare
    > with those found using Equations (3--61) and (3--62)? These two
    > equations must be solved for the moments of the logs. With data

*y x*

> **The Gamma (Pearson Type 3) Distribution**
>
> This distribution receives extensive use in hydrology simply because
> of its shape and its well-known mathematical properties. The
> three-parameter gamma distribution is sketched in Figure 3--15 and has
> the pleasing proper- ties of being bounded on the left (the lower
> limit is 5015 cfs) and of positive skewness. (The distribution can
> also be used with negative skewness.) Although the three parameters of
> the PDF are simple functions of the mean, variance, and skewness
> (Kite, 1977; Bobée and Ashkar, 1991), it is more common in hydrologic
> applications to evaluate the CDF with frequency fac- tors (Section
> 3.3), for which the PDF parameters are unnecessary. (How- ever, note
> that spreadsheet functions such as Excel's GAMMADIST and GAMMAINV make
> it possible to avoid the tedious process of using any tabular values;

>
> *Q~T~* = *Q* + *K*(*C~s~*, *T*) . *S~Q~*. (3--67)

The frequency factor *K* \[Eq. (3--43)\] serves as the required function

*h*(*F*) as long as it is not also a function of skewness. For example,

1.  Estimate the mean of the logs and the standard deviation of the logs
    using the procedure just described for the normal distribution. That
    is, the logarithm of the value plotted at 50% is the mean of the
    logs:

> *y* = ln *x~m~* = ln *x*~50~ (3--71)

> *S~y~* = ln *x*~84.1~ - ln *x*~50~ = ln(*x*~84.1~\>*x*~50~), (3--72)
>
> *y* = ln *x*.

2.  Knowing these moments of *y*, the moments of the untransformed
    variable *x* must be calculated from the relationships given in
    Equa- tions (3--61) and (3--62).

> but these tests are seldom helpful in discriminating among different

> tend to lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that the distribution
> fits the data. See, for example, the very wide 90% confidence
> intervals plotted in Figure 3--18 using the *KS* statistic. An
> alternative is to use heuristic measures of goodness of fit, such as
> the average of absolute values of deviations between the fitted and
> plotted CDF (Benson, 1968). Another possibility is to include the
> third and fourth moments of the data in the analysis, since these may
> be used to categorize different distribu- tions (Harr, 1977). But the
> problems of estimation of higher moments have already been discussed.
> Better alternatives (in the sense of greater discrimina- tion among
> alternative distributions) are the probability plot correlation coef-
> ficient method and L-moment tests, summarized by Stedinger et al.
> (1993). In the end, the decision is often subjective and based on a
> preference for the underlying mechanism of one distribution vs.
> another. That is, the engineer may prefer the multiplicative mechanism
> of the lognormal distribution or the empiricism of the gamma or log
> Pearson type 3 distributions.
>
> Graphical comparison of the fitted and plotted CDFs is of considerable
> use in the decision. King (1971) has shown the form that several CDFs
> exhibit when plotted on the probability paper of another distribution,
> and Reich and Renard (1981) apply these shapes to hydrology. For
> example, if the data are plotted on lognormal paper and a Gumbel
> distribution fits the data, the data should appear with curvature.
> Unfortunately, the gamma and log Pearson 3 distributions cannot be
> assessed in this manner, since they have no probability paper.
>
> Instead of trying several distributions and attempting to select the
> best fit, one could simply accept the recommendations of the U.S.
> IACWD (1982) (formerly the U.S. Water Resources Council; Benson,
>
> 1968\) that the LP3 distribution is best suited for flood frequency
> analysis. On the other hand, the log-Gumbel (extreme-value type II)
> was deter- mined by the Natural Environment Research Council (1975) to
> be pref- erable for flood frequency analysis in Great Britain.
> Individual rivers are likely to vary in their optimal distribution,
> and the question of which distribution to use for floods and myriad
> other hydrologic variables will always remain open.
>
> **GRAPHICAL COMPARISON OF FOUR DISTRIBUTIONS**
>
> Which distribution is best for the data for the Siletz River? One very
> qualitative assessment can be made from the four PDFs shown in Fig-
> ure 3--15. From the figure, we see little difference among them. How-
> ever, common practice is to compare the CDFs on probability paper; and
> for this purpose, all the distributions may be plotted together on
> lognormal paper for another qualitative assessment. Several predicted
> magnitudes are needed, since all but the lognormal will plot as smooth
> curves. These calculations are shown in Table 3--8 (including more
> than just the required two points for the lognormal). The resulting
> plots are shown in Figure 3--19 along with selected data points (only
> every fifth data point is plotted in the middle of the distribution,
> in order to have a better view of the four fitted distributions).

> ![](./images/media/image209.png)It is important to realize that, were
> confidence limits shown (as on Fig. 3--18), they would be very wide at
> the upper limit of the CDF, reflect- ing the uncertainty of predicting
> the magnitude of, say, the 100-yr flood from only 75 yr of data. The
> uncertainty can be quantified by computing the standard deviation of
> the estimates at the extremes, using a different procedure for each
> distribution (Kite, 1977; Stedinger et al., 1993). One way to reduce
> the uncertainty is to use a longer period of record (not pos- sible)
> or a regional analysis, in which regional streamflow data are
>
> aggregated and used in a regression-type analysis (Section 3.7). The
> National Research Council (1988) study describes several options for
> improvements of frequency estimates, including regional analysis,
> better structure in models, and focusing on the upper extremes (for
> floods).

> Finally, plots such as Figure 3--19 can be used to interpolate for
> flood frequencies for the gamma and LP3 distributions, as suggested in
> Examples 3--12 and 3--13, in lieu of the use of tables or spreadsheet
> functions. Given the uncertainty inherent in flood frequency
> estimates, two-significant- figure accuracy from a plot is generally
> accurate enough. For instance, the nonexceedance probability of a flow
> of 30,000 cfs is approximately 93% by any of the four distributions,
> with a corresponding return period of about 14 years.

>
> All the computations, tables, and figures in this chapter were
> prepared eas- ily in Excel. Functions for obtaining the cumulative
> normal distribution and its inverse and the cumulative gamma
> distribution and its inverse are par- ticularly helpful. On the other
> hand, preparation of probability paper plots of the type of Figures
> 3--18 and 3--19 takes more effort, since the vertical lines of the
> probability scale must be inserted ("drawn") and labeled by the user.
> Nonetheless, the task is straightforward.
>
> Flood frequency software is available from various sources. The Hydro-
> logical Frequency Analysis (HFA) program may be purchased as an
> adjunct to the text by Bobée and Ashkar (1991) for analysis and
> probability plots of various formulations of the gamma and LP3
> distributions. The Bulletin 17B procedure of the IACWD (1982) has been
> programmed by the Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering
> Center (HEC), and is available as the program HEC-SSP (HEC Statistical
> Software Package). See the HEC web- site
> (<http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/)> for information about how to obtain
> the software. A similar program for Bulletin 17B analysis, PEAKFQ, has
> been prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey and may be downloaded from
> its website,
> [http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/surface_water.](http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/surface_water)
> At the same location, the program SWSTAT may be downloaded, which
> performs many different kinds of statistical and related analyses on
> time-series data, includ- ing preparation of flow-duration curves,
> trend analysis, and a simplified form of the Bulletin 17B analysis.

> Flood frequency estimates illustrated in this chapter rely upon a
> record of flows measured at one station. The shorter the record, the

> **REGIONAL ANALYSIS**
>
> Hosking and Wallis (1997). One alternative is to perform regional
> esti- mates of key statistics, such as skewness, illustrated with the
> discussion of Figure 3--10. Another alternative is a regional
> regression: *T*-year floods are computed for as many streams as
> possible using the LP3 distribution, sometimes with the aid of
> simulation models, and their magnitudes regressed against catchment
> characteristics. The relationship often takes the form of a multiple
> regression analysis (power-function form), in which catchment area is
> usually the most important independent variable. In this way,
> uncertainty in a short-record-length estimate at one station is bal-
> anced against a longer-record estimate at other stations. Such
> relationships are also good ways in which to estimate flood peaks at
> ungaged locations. The U.S. Geological Survey has prepared these
> relationships for many locations in the United States. Examples
> include Harris et al. (1979) and Cooper (2005) for western Oregon,
> Sauer et al. (1983) for urban areas in the United States, Laenen
> (1983) for urban areas in western Oregon, and Franklin and Losey
> (1984) for Tallahassee, Florida. An automated pro- gram, NFF (for
> National Flood Frequency), which incorporates all pub- lished results
> for the United States, has been published by the USGS (Ries and
> Crouse, 2002). Local offices of the USGS should be contacted for
> access to studies for specific regions.
>
> The nationwide urban equations of Sauer et al. (1983) depend on local
> estimates of rural peaks and cannot be demonstrated here. However, as
> an example, the USGS (Franklin and Losey, 1984) has performed a flood
> fre- quency analysis on 15 basins in the Tallahassee, Florida, area
> using a com- bination of continuous simulation and regression. The
> resulting regression equation for most of the Tallahassee area is
>
> *Q~p~*(*T*) = *C~p~A^a^IA^b^*, (3--82)
>
> where
>
> *Q~p~* = predicted flood peak for return period *T* (cfs),
>
> *A* = drainage area (mi^2^),
>
> *IA* = impervious area as percentage of total area *A*,
>
> and *C~p~*, *a*, and *b* are coefficients that are functions of return
> period, as given in Table 3--9. The 15 basins ranged from 0.2 to 16
> mi^2^ and imperviousness ranged from 5.8% to 54%. Coefficients of
> determination (*R*^2^) for the multiple regression ranged from 0.97 to
> 0.99 for the indicated equations, but standard errors of estimate were
> 18% to 30%. That is, there is a 68% chance (one standard deviation on
> either side of the mean, for the normal distribution) that the unknown
> "true" flood estimate will fall within 18% to 30% of the true mean.
> The regression predictions are mainly for use in ungaged catch- ments.
> For example, for the 3.44 mi^2^ McGinnis Arm Catchment in Tallahas-
> see, the imperviousness percentage is 28.3, for which Equation (3--82)
> yields a 10-yr peak flow of 1850 cfs.

> **SUMMARY**
>
> This chapter contains only a sampling of possible topics in frequency
> analysis. Other topics of particular importance are improved
> estimation procedures by the method of maximum likelihood and
> L-moments (see Section 3.3), and confidence limits and uncertainty
> (see Section 3.6). The reader may refer to the cited references for
> ad- ditional information.
>
> In this chapter, introductory definitions related to description of
> data and probability theory are followed by methods for fitting
> theoretical frequency distri- butions to measured data. One discrete
> and five continuous distributions are de- scribed and applied. The
> emphasis is on flood frequency analysis, but the procedures can be
> applied to any set of independent hydrologic data, such as rainfall,
> stage, annual flow volumes, temperatures, and water quality
> parameters. Apart from the recommended use of the log-Pearson 3
> distribution for flood frequency analysis in
>
> the United States (IACWD, 1982), there is no consensus regarding
> distributions most suited to any particular variable; however, for
> storm runoff quality, studies have shown that storm runoff event mean
> concentrations (i.e., flow-weighted av- erage storm event
> concentrations) are almost universally distributed lognormally
> (Driscoll, 1986).
>
> Although most of the distributions discussed can also be applied to
> minima (e.g., droughts), the parameter estimates may vary from those
> given for the maxima to accommodate the possible negative skewness of
> the droughts. For use of any dis- tribution other than the normal for
> minima, reference should be made to Gumbel (1958), Benjamin and
> Cornell (1970), Stedinger et al. (1993), or Haan (2002) for parameter
> estimation.

1.  This chapter employs Siletz River data for the continuous period
    1925--1999. As of this writing, peak flow data through water year
    2010 are available on the USGS Oregon surface water data webpage
    [http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/sw,](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/sw)
    including for Gage Number 14305500, which is the Siletz River. You
    will be asked in different problems in this chapter to update the
    Chapter 3 examples by using the 86-yr record, 1925--2010.

    a.  Download the peak flow data for the Siletz River, and enter the
        data into a spreadsheet.

    b.  Plot the 86 years of peak flows (1925--2010) and a 5-yr running
        mean vs. their water year, to update Figure 3--2. Comment in
        general about the appearance of this time series, in the manner
        of the discussion of Figure 3--2.

    c.  Using the updated data, develop new relative frequency and
        cumulative frequency histograms; that is, update Figures 3--4
        and 3--5.

2.  \(a\) Use the data found in Problem 3.1 to calculate the mean,
    standard devia- tion, and skew coefficient (Eqs. 3--37, 3--38, and
    3--40) of the updated Siletz River data (1925--2010).

(b) Repeat part (a) using the logs (base 10) of the Siletz River data.

(c) Develop the weighted skewness of the logs according to the Bulletin
    17B protocol. That is, redo Example 3--3. At the conclusion of this
    problem, you should have an updated version of Table 3--2.

    1.  A temporary cofferdam is being designed to protect a 5-yr
        construction project from the 30-yr flood. What is the
        probability that the cofferdam will be overtopped:

        a.  at least once during the 5-yr project,

        b.  not at all during the project,

        c.  in the first year only,

        d.  in the fourth year and fifth year exactly?

    a.  The probability that the park will flood next year

    b.  The probability that the park will flood at least once in the
        > next 20 yr

    c.  The probability that the park will flood three times in the next
        > 20 yr

    d.  The probability that the park will flood 10 times in the next 20
        > yr

5.  This problem asks you to perform a descriptive analysis using real
    > data of inter- est to you. The problem should be done using
    > spreadsheet or similar software.

    a.  Download a series of annual maximum flows for a river of
        > interest to you. USGS data may be obtained starting at the
        > website <http://water.usgs.gov/> nwis/. Import the data into
        > your spreadsheet or similar software. Convert the lines of
        > text data into columnar data.

    b.  Note the characteristics of the basin from its description in
        > the USGS files. What are the basin area and latitude and
        > longitude of the gage? Are there diversions, controls, or
        > storage (e.g., reservoirs) upstream?

    c.  Plot the time series of peak flows and log~10~ (flows) vs. water
        year. The series of log~10~ (flows) should have a lower
        coefficient of variation. Does the shape of the time-series plot
        of flows suggest that the time-series of river peak flows is
        nonstationary? If so, discuss possible reasons.

    d.  Compute and plot relative-frequency histograms for the flows and
        log (flows). Discuss any difference in skewness evident from the
        two plots.

    e.  Compute the following statistics for the series of flows and for
        the series of log~10~ (flows): number, average, unbiased
        variance, unbiased standard deviation, coefficient of variation,
        unbiased skewness, maximum, and minimum.

6.  For the data of Problem 3.25, compute a weighted skew coefficient
    according to the Bulletin 17B method.

7.  For the data of Problem 3.25, fit a log Pearson 3 distribution to
    the peak flows, using the method of moments described in this text.
    Use the weighted skew coefficient computed in Problem 3.26.

    a.  Compute estimated flows for return periods listed in Table 3--4.

    b.  Plot the fitted CDF on lognormal probability paper.

    c.  Using the Cunnane plotting-position formula (with parameter *a*
        = 0.4), plot enough of the measured flows to provide a
        comparison similar to Figure 3--19. Discuss the fit.

8.  Repeat Problem 3.27 using the lognormal and three-parameter gamma
    distributions.

9.  For a station of interest to you, download 10 yr of daily average
    streamflow data from the USGS website
    [http://water.usgs.gov/nwis/.](http://water.usgs.gov/nwis/) Paste
    the data into a spreadsheet and convert the text data to columns.
    Construct and plot a flow- duration curve for these data. From the
    table and chart, what are the flows equaled or exceeded 20%, 50%,
    and 90% of the time?

10. Interevent times for winter storms arriving at Corvallis, Oregon,
    for the months November through April for the winters of 1996--97,
    1997--98, and 1998--99 were determined, and a frequency histogram
    prepared as shown in the table below. The average interevent time
    was 2.59 days.

    a.  Fit an exponential distribution to these data by finding the
        parameter l.

    b.  Plot the relative-frequency histogram and the fitted exponential
        PDF on the same chart. Care may need to be taken to be sure that
        the histogram and PDF are properly aligned. Each day (0--1,
        1--2, and so on) is a class interval.

    c.  From the relative-frequency histogram, compute the
        cumulative-frequency histogram and plot on arithmetic graph
        paper.

    d.  On two-cycle semilog paper (or using spreadsheet options for
        log-scales), plot the empirical CDF from part (c) and the fitted
        CDF. On this "prob- ability paper," values should be plotted at
        the class mark, centering on

> half-days. The empirical values from part (c) should be plotted as
> individual points, and one fitted CDF (exceedance probability) should
> be plotted as a straight line.

e.  What is the probability that the time between winter storms is ≤ 3
    > days? Compute using both the empirical CDF and the fitted CDF.

12. Using statistics for Siletz River peak flows, 1979--1999 (Table
    > 3--1), generate a se- ries of normally distributed synthetic
    > streamflows by following these guidelines.

    a.  By performing a regression of flows for the period 1980--1999
        > vs. flows during 1979--1998, verify that the serial
        > correlation coefficient for this time period is 0.1411.

    b.  Verify that the mean and unbiased standard deviation for the
        > full 21-year period are 19,343 cfs and 7217 cfs, respectively.
        > Use these values for part (c).

    c.  The list of 21 *N*(0, 1) random numbers below was generated in
        Excel using the Tools/Data Analysis/Random Number Generation
        option with a seed of 12345. (The option for a seed allows one
        to generate identical sequences of random numbers.) Assuming
        that the initial flow = mean (at "step 0"), generate a sequence
        of 21 random flows using Equation (3--83). Com- pute the mean,
        standard deviation, and serial correlation coefficient of the
        synthetic flow sequence to see how well these statistics are
        preserved. *Optional:* Create a new series of *N*(0, 1) random
        numbers and repeat the generation. Notice that as the mean and
        standard deviation of the random numbers differ from 0 and 1,
        respectively, so do the mean and standard deviation of the
        synthetic sequence differ from their historic values.

> The movement of a flood wave down a channel or through a reservoir and

> The **storage routing** concept is most easily understood by referring

> time *t*~1~, inflow and outflow are equal and the maximum storage is
> reached. For times exceeding *t*~1~, outflow exceeds inflow and the
> reservoir empties. Area *C* represents the volume of water that flows
> out of the reservoir and must equal area *A* if the reservoir begins
> and ends at the same level. The peak of the outflow from a reservoir
> should intersect the inflow hydrograph as shown in Figure 4--1, since,

a.  Determine the average storage for each one-day period (Δ*t* = 1
    day). Graph storage vs. time for the reservoir for the event. Assume
    that *S*~0~ = 0 (the reservoir is initially empty).

b.  What is the (approximate) maximum storage reached during this storm
    event?

> River routing differs from reservoir routing in that storage in a
> river reach of length *L* depends on more than just outflow. The peak
> of the out- flow hydrograph from a reach is usually attenuated and
> delayed compared with that of the inflow hydrograph. Because storage
> in a river reach is a function of whether stages are rising or
> falling, storage in this case is a func- tion of both outflow and
> inflow for the routing reach (see Section 4.3). Also, as river stages
> rise high enough to inundate a floodplain beyond the banks of the
> channel, significant velocity reductions are observed in the
> floodplain compared with the main channel. Example 4--2 presents
> differences between river and reservoir routing.

> Hydraulic routing is more complex and accurate than hydrologic

> The Muskingum method assumes that flow and storage are both related to

> *x* = weighting factor, which varies from 0 to 0.5 for a given reach.
>
> For the case of linear reservoir routing where *S* depends only on
> outflow, *x* = 0 in Equation (4--4). In smooth uniform channels, *x* =
> 0.5 yields equal weight to inflow and outflow, which theoretically
> results in pure translation of the wave. A typical range for most

> To determine Muskingum coefficients, we guess a value of *x* and then
> plot \[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\] vs. *S*. The one plot that comes closest
> to being a straight line is chosen to determine the coefficient
> values. The average value is *x* = 0.2 for a natural stream.
> Therefore, we assume that *x* must lie between
>
> 0.1 and 0.3. Plots of \[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\] vs. *S* are made for *x*
> = 0.1, *x* = 0.2, and *x* = 0.3 using the values listed in Table E4--4
> (see Fig. E4--4).

The lower outflow is an 18-in. reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) that will
be assumed to behave as an orifice with an entrance loss coefficient,
*C~d~*, of 0.9:

*Q*orifice = *CdAo* 22*gh*,

> where
>
> *Q*~orifice~ = orifice outflow (cfs or cms),
>
> *C~d~* = orifice entrance loss coefficient,
>
> *A~o~* = orifice area = p*D*^2^ 4 for a circular pipe of diameter *D*,
> *g* = gravitational acceleration (32.2 ft/s^2^ or 9.8 m/s^2^), and
>
> *h* = depth above the orifice centerline (ft or m).
>
> The ogee spillway is assumed to behave like a weir (Davis, 1952;
> French, 1985) with equation
>
> *Q*~weir~ = *C~e~* 12\>32 22*g L*1*h* - *h*~0~21.5,
>
> where
>
> *Q*~weir~ = spillway discharge (cfs or cms),
>
> *C~e~* = weir discharge coefficient,
>
> *L* = weir length (perpendicular to discharge) (ft or m), and
>
> *h*~0~ = elevation of weir crest (ft or m).
>
> For this example, *D* = 1.5 ft, *C~d~* = 0.9, *C~e~* ≈ 0.7 (Davis,
> 1952), *L* = 15 ft, and *h*~0~ = 5 ft. The orifice and weir outflows
> are assumed to obey the indicated equations even for low heads. The
> stage--discharge analysis
>
> could be refined in the event that this assumption must be modified.
> The sum of the orifice and weir outflows constitutes a **rating
> curve** for the small reservoir. The rating curve could be tabular or
> derived from exper- iments in lieu of equations such as those for the
> orifice and weir.
>
> Using the depth, storage, and outflow relationships developed in the
> table, route the hydrograph through the reservoir. What is the maximum
> height reached in the reservoir for this inflow? Use Δ*t* = 10 min.

> **SOLUTION**
>
> There are two steps to the solution: In step 1, we develop a storage-
> indication curve from the indicated geometry and outflow
> relationships. This will involve additional computations to determine
> storage vs. depth. Step 2 is the routing procedure using the
> continuity equation and the storage-indication curve.
>
> The geometry of the trapezoids results in the surface areas shown in
> the table. Storage (volume) *S* is the integral of surface area *A*:
>
> *S* = 1*A dh*.
>
> The integration is performed numerically in the table, using the
> **trapezoi- dal rule**. In this case, incremental volumes are computed
> by assuming the function *A h* can be approximated as a series of
> trapezoids with sides *A~i~* and *A~i~*~+1~ and width Δ*h*. Then the
> incremental volume is
>
> Δ*S [Ai ]{.underline}*[+ *Ai* + 1]{.underline} Δ*h*.
>
> 2
>
> Thus, the incremental volume between depth 2 ft and 3 ft is

Δ*S* =

> 9233 ft^2^ + 11,064 ft^2^
>
> 2
>
> . 1 ft = 10,148 ft^3^.
>
> Cumulative volume is simply the sum of the incremental volumes. Note
> that the elevation increment Δ*h* need not remain constant and can be
> reduced if greater definition of outflows is needed---above the weir
> crest, for instance. Also, note that the depth *h* is an intermedi-
> ate variable in the computations and is not used in the remainder of
> the procedure. Finally, observe the importance of accurate contours,
> normally derived from a survey, in developing the stage-vs.-volume
> relationship.
>
> Next, we develop a storage-indication curve for the pond. This is a
> plot of 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* vs. *Q* (where *Q* is total outflow). For
> instance, at *Q* = 50 cfs, *S* = 59,173 ft^3^ and

2*S* 2(59,173 ft^3^)

> Δ*t* + *Q* = (10 min)(60 s/min) + 50 cfs = 247 cfs.
>
> These values are tabulated in the preceding table, and the storage-
> indication curve is plotted in Figure E4--5(c). The curve is simply
> another way of presenting the hydraulic relationship between storage
> and outflow. The meaning is that if by another mechanism the quantity
> 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* can be determined, then the outflow *Q* can be
> determined from this relation- ship. Note that the storage-indication
> curve has nothing to do with the inflow hydrograph; the only link is

**KINEMATIC WAVE**

**ROUTING**

> The kinematic wave assumption is that inertial and pressure effects
> are unimportant and that the weight or gravity force of fluid is
> approximately balanced by the resistive forces of bed friction \[Eq.
> (4--30) and Table 4--1\]. Kinematic waves will not accelerate
> appreciably and can flow only in a downstream direction without any
> crest subsidence. Hence, kinematic wave methods cannot account for
> backwater. The flood wave will be observed as a uniform rise and fall
> in water surface over a relatively long period of time. Thus,
> kinematic waves represent the characteristic changes in discharge,
> velocity, and water surface elevation with time at any one location on
> an overland flow plane or along a stream channel. Kinematic waves are
> often classified as uniform, unsteady flows.
>
> The kinematic wave method of routing overland and river flows is
> included in the HEC-HMS program, as described in detail in Chapter 5.
> The following discussion and numerical solutions are based on the HMS
> program because of the wide acceptance and availability (Hydrologic
> Engineering
>
> Center, 2006). Kinematic wave routing is also an important aspect of
> the Storm Water Management Model (Huber and Dickinson, 1988), as
> described in Chapter 6, and the Vflo model described in Chapter 11.
>
> The concept incorporated into HEC-HMS uses various elements such as
> overland flow planes, collector channels, and main channels to route
> kine- matic waves (Fig. 4--9). These various elements are combined to
> describe basin and subbasin responses to storm events. Overland flow
> is handled

> After overland runoff is routed down the length of the overland flow

**HYDRAULIC RIVER**

**ROUTING**

> The application of the Saint Venant equations \[Eqs. (4--23) and
> (4--27)\] in flood routing involves solving them simultaneously down
> the length of a stream channel. An excellent review of methods is
> given by Price (1974), who compares four of the more important
> numerical methods for hydraulic flood routing with exact analytical
> solutions for the monoclinal wave (Sec- tion 4.5). Price found that
> the four-point implicit numerical scheme of Amein and Fang (1970) was
> the most efficient of the methods and is most accurate when Δ*x* Δ*t*
> is approximately equal to the speed of the monoclinal wave, the
> kinematic wave speed. In the numerical schemes, the stage was defined
> at the upstream boundary, and rating curve conditions were specified
> at the downstream boundary.
>
> The objective of the numerical flood routing method is to simulate the
> propagation of a flood downstream in a river, given a stage or
> discharge hydrograph at an upstream section. The preceding methods
> provide the most accurate solution available for predicting floods
> downstream in a large river or for considering effects of channel
> alteration or reservoir storage. Because the computational effort is
> relatively large for any numerical solu- tion, careful consideration
> should be given to selecting one of the available hydraulic methods
> vs. one of the simpler, approximate methods such as kine- matic wave
> or the Muskingum method.
>
> **Characteristic Methods**
>
> The early approaches to numerical flood routing were based on the
> charac- teristic form of the governing equations. This form basically
> replaces the par- tial differential equations with four ordinary
> differential equations, which are then solved numerically along the
> characteristic curves. Henderson (1966) and Overton and Meadows (1976)
> present details of the conversion. However, the characteristic method
> is cumbersome because of required interpolation over
>
> the variable grid mesh in space and time. The method involves
> integration along two sets of characteristic curves, and a network of
> variable points is located in the *xt*-plane by the intersection of
> the forward and backward char- acteristic curves. With the advent of
> the more efficient implicit methods described in the sections that
> follow, the characteristic method offers no addi- tional accuracy with
> relatively complex interpolation problems.
>
> **Explicit Methods**
>
> Explicit methods are primarily the outcome of the pioneering work of
> Stoker (1957) and Issacson et al. (1956). A network of nodes, as shown
> in Figure 4--13, is defined for solving the governing equations in *x*
> and *t*. The variables are known at points *L*, *M*, and *R.* The
> centered difference solution is used to solve Equations (4--23) and
> (4--27) for velocity *v*(*P*) and depth*y*(*P*) at point *P*. The
> initial condition and boundary conditions (upstream and downstream)
> must be known from inflow hydrographs and stage--outflow relations.
> The major disadvantage of the explicit approach is the requirement of
> using small time steps, known as the Courant condition, to avoid
> stability problems \[Δ*t* ... Δ*x c*, where *c* is defined in Eq.
> (4--34)\].
>
> **Implicit Methods**
>
> Implicit methods have received the most interest in recent years
> because they overcome the stability problems of explicit methods and
> allow fewer time steps for flood routing. The four-point implicit
> method of Amein and Fang (1970) has the feature of solving the
> nonlinear simultaneous finite- difference equations using the Newton
> iteration technique. In this method, a set of *N* equations with *N*
> unknowns results from writing the equations in space and time and
> incorporating upstream and downstream boundary con- ditions. The
> details of the iteration process are given in Amein and Fang (1970)
> with relevant boundary conditions. The method was applied to sev- eral
> actual flood predictions in North Carolina and was found to be
> accurate and more efficient than the explicit or characteristic
> methods. Computer

> level simultaneously, and larger Δ*x* and Δ*t* values can be used than
> in the explicit method.

> **Diffusion Model**
>
> The diffusion wave model (also called the noninertia model) is
> intermediate in complexity between the kinematic wave model and the
> full dynamic wave model and assumes that the inertia terms in Equation
> (4--27) are negligible compared with the pressure, friction, and

> 0*t* + *c* 0*x* = *D*~1~ 0*x*2 , (4--63)
>
> where *c* is wave celerity and *D*~1~ is a diffusion coefficient
> (defined in the next section). The effect of the diffusion term,
> compared with the kinematic wave, is to make *y* decrease in the view
> of an observer moving at velocity *c*. Thus, attenuation of the flood
> wave is included in the diffusion model, but not for the kinematic
> wave. Attenuation may be important in long rivers or for rivers with
> large floodplains.
>
> The kinematic model applies to shallow flow on steep slopes or to
> long- duration flood waves. The diffusion model applies to a wider
> range of condi- tions, and the full dynamic model applies to any
> condition.

> The Muskingum method presented in Section 4.2 is based on the
> continuity equation and the storage--discharge relation. Cunge (1969)

> to produce a unique relationship between the two for a particular
> location and cross section. However, unless flow can be approximated

> will be greater during the rising stage of a flood hydrograph than
> during the falling stage, leading to a loop rating curve, as shown in
> Figure 4--14. If the hydrograph has multiple peaks, the curve can be
> very complex, as shown in Figure 4--14(a). A theoretical shape for a
> smooth, single-peak hydrograph is shown in Figure 4--14(b).

> The physical explanation for the hysteresis present in the rating

> **Unsteady or Dynamic Models**
>
> Hydrologic routing techniques are not adequate for modeling unsteady
> flows subject to backwater or tidal effects and channels with very
> mild bottom slopes. Chapter 7 discusses the unsteady state version of
> HEC-RAS which uses UNET as the internal program for computations. The
> St. Venant equa- tions, as described earlier, are typically used to
> solve unsteady flow prob- lems. As a result of the development of
> computer hardware and software technology, simulation software became
> widely available to solve the full St. Venant equations in the 1980s
> and 1990s. In the United States, there are two widely used dynamic
> models using the St. Venant equations, FLDWAV and UNET. The FLDWAV
> model that evolved from its earlier versions DAM- BRK (1984) and
> DWOPER (1978) was developed by D. Fread and has been mainly applied to
> the national river forecast; while the UNET model was developed by
> Barkau and has been incorporated into the USACE Hydro- logic
> Engineering Center's River Analysis Systems (HEC-RAS) in order to
> simulate one-dimensional unsteady flow through a full network of open
> channels (Barkau, 1992; HEC, 2010).
>
> Discrete solution over a grid and iteration are the two major
> processes in the computational process in solving the St. Venant
> Equations. HEC-RAS uses an implicit finite-difference scheme in the
> stage of discretization to determine the new values of water level and
> discharge at a discrete point based on all discrete points and with at
> least two time steps solved simultane- ously. This implicit scheme is
> found more stable than other explicit schemes. Both HEC-RAS and DWOPER
> use the four-point numerical scheme. Solv- ing the implicit equations
> requires an iteration approach, which means that at a given time step,
> successive solutions of water level and discharge are obtained until
> the difference of the latest values and the values from the previous
> iteration is small enough. Thus, it is regarded to have converged on
> the correct value. For instance, HEC-RAS uses 0.02 ft and 20 as the
> default water-level convergence and the maximum number of iterations.
>
> The unsteady flow component in HEC-RAS was developed primarily for
> subcritical flow regime calculations. But with version (4.1) of
> HEC-RAS, the model is able to perform mixed flow regime (subcritical,
> super-critical, hydrau- lic jumps, and draw downs) calculations in the
> unsteady flow computation mod- ule. The hydraulic calculations for
> cross sections, bridges, culverts, and other hydraulic structures that
> were developed for the steady flow component were incorporated into
> the unsteady flow module. Additionally, the unsteady flow component is
> capable of handling dam break analysis, levee breaching and
> overtopping, pumping stations, navigation dam operations, and
> pressurized pipe systems. Further details of the unsteady flow
> component can be found in the manual provided with HEC-RAS (HEC,
> 2010).

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 4 covers hydrologic (storage) and hydraulic routing methods to
> predict flood movement for rivers and reservoirs. Hydrologic routing
> requires solution of the lumped continuity equation and a
> storage--outflow relation. The relation may be a function of both
> inflow and outflow for a river, but for a reservoir, storage is
> related only to outflow. Simple numerical methods are presented for
> solving the flood rout- ing equations through time.
>
> Hydraulic river routing is more complex than hydrologic routing in
> that both the one-dimensional continuity and the momentum equations
> must be solved. In many cases, the momentum equation may be simplified
> to Manning's equation; the procedure is called kinematic wave routing.
> Most practical kinematic wave solutions require numerical methods to
> compute actual hydrographs, such as those that are currently included
> in the HEC-HMS (HMS) Flood Hydrograph package or the Vflo model
> (Vieux, 2004).
>
> Full hydraulic (dynamic) routing requires solution of the Saint Venant
> equations, for which advanced numerical schemes must be employed to
> maintain mathematical stability and provide accurate solutions.
> Implicit finite-difference methods are the most commonly used
> techniques. One of the most accurate com- puter models for dynamic
> routing is DWOPER, which uses the four-point implicit method. DWOPER
> (as well as the newer NWS FLDWAV) has been extensively tested for
> floods on the Mississippi, Ohio, and Columbia Rivers with excellent
> results.
>
> The UNET model was developed by Barkau (1992) and has been incorpo-
> rated into the USACE HEC-RAS model in order to simulate
> one-dimensional unsteady flow through a full network of open channels
> (HEC, 2010). This model is currently widely used for applications to

    result of these assumptions, what are the shortcomings of the
    method?

    rout- ing method described in this chapter? What hydraulic
    conditions are neces- sary for kinematic wave assumptions to be
    valid for overland flow? What are advantages and disadvantages of
    using kinematic channel routing compared with solving the Saint
    Venant equations?

8.  Develop a Muskingum routing program in Excel, and repeat Problem
    4.7. Compare the results.

9.  Flood route the given input hydrograph through a linear reservoir
    (*S* = *KQ*), given *K* = 2.5 hr and Δ*t* = 1 hr. Solve one step
    beyond the peak outflow by developing a simple relation for
    computing outflow *Q*~2~, as a function of *Q*~1~, and inflows
    *I*~1~ and *I*~2~. Assume that storage and outflow are initially
    zero. Use the fact that *S* = *K*(*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*) and *I* - *Q*
    = Δ*S*\>Δ*t*. (*Hint:* Use the fact that the reservoir is linear to
    determine *x*).

10. A detention pond needs to be designed with a total capacity of 30
    ac-in. of stor- age. The inflow hydrograph for the pond is given in
    Figure P4--10. Assume that that pond is initially 50% full and
    outflow will cease when the pond is again 50% full. Graphically
    determine the peak outflow from the pond assuming a linear rise and
    fall in the outflow hydrograph. Draw the outflow hydrograph. At what
    time does outflow cease? (*Hint:* The outflow hydrograph will peak
    at the intersection of the inflow and the outflow hydrographs. Also,
    make use of the fact that the available volume for storage is equal
    to the area between the two triangular hydrographs and must be equal
    to 50% of the storage.)

12. A reservoir has a linear *S-Q* relationship of

*S* = *KQ*,

> where *K* = 1.3 hr. The inflow hydrograph for a storm event is given
> in the table.

a.  Develop a simple recursive relation using the continuity equation
    and *S-Q* relationship for the linear reservoir \[i.e., *aQ*~2~ =
    *bQ*~1~ + *cI*, where *a, b*, and *c* are constants and *I* =
    (*I*~1~ + *I*~2~)\>2\].

b.  Storage route the hydrograph through the reservoir using Δ*t* = 1
    hr.

c.  Explain why the shape of storage-discharge relations is usually not
    linear for actual reservoirs.

13. Given the reservoir with a storage-discharge relationship governed
    by the equation

*S* = *KQ*^3\>2^,

> route the inflow hydrograph for Problem 4.5 using storage routing
> techniques and a value of *K* = 1.31 for *Q* in m^3^/s and *S* in
> m^3^/s-hr. Discuss the differences in the outflow hydrograph for this
> reservoir and for the reservoir of Problem 4.12. Use Δ*t* = 1 hr.

14. A storm event occurred on Falls Creek Watershed that produced a
    rainfall pat- tern of 5 cm/hr for the first 10 min, 10 cm/hr in the
    second 10 min, and 5 cm/hr in the next 10 min. The watershed is
    divided into three subbasins (see Fig. P4--14), with the unit
    hydrographs given in the following table. Subbasins *A* and *B* had
    a loss rate of 2.5 cm/hr for the first 10 min and 1.0 cm/hr
    thereafter. Subbasin *C* had a loss rate of 1.0 cm/hr for the first
    10 min and 0 cm/hr thereafter. Using a simple lag routing method
    (time shift the hydrograph by *K*), determine the storm hydrograph
    at point 2. Assume a lag time *K* of 40 min.
