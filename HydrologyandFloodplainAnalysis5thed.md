PREFACE

> The field of hydrology is of fundamental importance to civil and
> environ- mental engineers, hydrogeologists, and other earth scientists
> because of the environmental significance of water supply, major
> floods and droughts and their management, drainage and urban
> stormwater issues, floodplain man- agement, and water quality impacts.
> In recent years, hurricanes and storm surge have caused significant
> urban disasters, especially along coastal areas where urban
> development has expanded rapidly. This text was written to address the
> computational emphasis of modern hydrology at an undergrad- uate or
> graduate level, and to provide a balanced approach to important
> applications in hydrologic engineering and science.
>
> Increasing use and sophistication of personal computers has
> revolutionized the daily practice of hydrology. The Internet has
> revolutionized the accessibil- ity of hydrologic data and computer
> models. The impact of transferring online data from governmental and
> scientific sources to the practicing hydrologist or student has been
> phenomenal. Hydrologic data, digital terrain models, and mapping
> software linked with hydrologic modeling have allowed complex problems
> to be solved. Geographical information systems (GIS) and radar
> rainfall have greatly improved our ability to predict hydrologic
> response using distributed information. A number of major improvements
> have been made to existing hydrologic models, such as HEC and SWMM,
> and advances in distributed hydrologic modeling such as Vflo. A list
> of important websites and links currently used routinely in hydrology
> is contained in Appendix E and can be found at the textbook website:
> *hydrology.rice.edu*.

> **THE EVOLUTION OF HYDROLOGY**

-   **Chapter 1:** Extensive updates and changes, and completely rewrit-
    > ten with a more introductory coverage of topics, including simple
    > rainfall runoff and hydrograph analysis with new examples and
    > completely revised homework problems.

-   **Chapter 2:** Coverage of the unit hydrograph and includes hydro-
    > logic losses such as evaporation and infiltration. New examples
    > have been added on Green and Ampt infiltration, as well as many
    > additional homework problems.

-   **Chapter 4:** Expanded coverage and new examples on flood routing.
    > Many of the older numerical schemes have been simplified or
    > removed, and new homework problems have been added to stream- line
    > the chapter.

-   **Chapter 5:** Presents updated methods for simulating rainfall and
    > runoff, flood hydrograph prediction, and flood control options in
    > a

> watershed. New models are highlighted with new examples and a new
> detailed case study, including flood control alternatives. All new
> homework problems have been written as well.

-   **Chapter 10:** Describes the application of GIS and geospatial
    > infor- mation in hydrologic analysis and formulation of hydrologic
    > models. An updated list of available GIS and related software is
    > provided.

-   **Chapter 11:** Major advances in detecting accurate and representa-
    > tive rainfall with radar and rain gages are presented. The
    > applica- tion of radar rainfall as distributed model input is
    > described. Details on distributed hydrologic modeling are
    > presented for a case study, for which sample datasets are
    > available in Appendix E.

-   **Chapter 12:** Reviews the new emerging trends in flood control
    > methods and floodplain management, a vital topic given the recent
    > storm events in the United States, such as Hurricane Irene in the
    > northeast. A detailed discussion of massive hurricane impacts
    > along the Gulf Coast, including Hurricane Katrina and Ike, two of
    > the most damaging hurricanes in history.

-   **Chapter 13:** Brand new and includes emphasis on the San Antonio
    > River and Edwards Aquifer System in Central Texas, the Colorado
    > River Basin system, and the Thames River in England. The chapter
    > also briefly highlights international water issues in China and
    > South- east Asia. The chapter ends with a discussion of the
    > changing global condition and the need for sustainable interaction
    > between human and natural systems.

> **ORGANIZATION OF THE 5TH EDITION**
>
> The 5th edition of the text is divided into three main sections. The
> first sec- tion, consisting of the first four chapters, covers
> traditional topics in hydrol- ogy related to the water balance such
> as: (1) hydrologic principles, hydrologic cycle, and measurement
> techniques, (2) hydrologic analysis using hydrographs for
> rainfall-runoff, (3) statistical and flood frequency analysis, and (4)
> hydrologic and hydraulic flood routing methods. The sec- ond major
> section, Chapters 5 through 9, is designed to apply hydrologic theory
> and available hydrologic modeling techniques to several areas of
> engineering hydrology and design: watershed analysis, floodplain
> delinea- tion, ground water, and urban stormwater. The latest methods
> and com- puter models are emphasized in enough detail for practical
> use, and updated examples and new case studies are provided.
>
> Chapter 5 on Hydrologic Simulation Models has been completely redone
> and updated to include the latest model versions as highlighted below
> in the next section. Chapter 6, Urban Hydrology, presents methods and
> reviews available computer models for pipe and open channel storm
> drainage systems. The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5) is
> highlighted as the most comprehensive urban runoff model available
> today. Chapter 7, Floodplain Hydraulics, first reviews concepts from
> open channel flow and includes uni- form flow and critical flow
> coverage, as required to understand water surface
>
> profile computations. The HEC-RAS model is described in detail with a
> case study demonstrating the power of the model to evaluate natural
> floodplains. Chapter 8 presents ground water hydrology as a
> stand-alone chapter, including flow in porous media, aquifer
> properties, well mechanics, and computer appli- cations. Governing
> equations of flow are derived and applied to a number of ground water
> problems, including both steady-state and transient analyses. Chapter
> 9, written by James Thompson, is a comprehensive chapter on design
> applications in hydrology. It addresses design rainfall, small
> watershed design, hydraulic design, detention pond design, detailed
> culvert design, and flood- plain mitigation design issues. It is one
> of the most comprehensive design chap- ters ever written and presents
> both the theory and method behind modern hydrologic and hydraulic
> design techniques.
>
> In the final section of the 5th edition, three chapters (10, 11, 12)
> guide the user to the next generation of hydrologic computation,
> watershed eval- uation, and discussion of important severe storm
> impacts and flood man- agement. No other textbook presents this type
> of material all in one place. Chapter 13, a new chapter for the 5th
> edition, presents details of major water resource projects around the
> world.
>
> Chapter 10 presents the use of geographic information systems (GIS)
> and digital elevation models (DEMs) as important tools for watershed
> analysis, hydrologic modeling, and modern floodplain delineation. Many
> useful hydrologic datasets and software are now widely available in
> high- resolution digital form on the web (see Appendix E). Chapter 11
> depicts some of the latest technology on the use of NEXRAD radar data
> to esti- mate rainfall intensities over watershed areas. Radar
> rainfall has greatly improved our ability to predict rainfall patterns
> over a watershed and offers real advantages for hydrologic flood alert
> systems. Distributed hydrologic modeling is introduced that
> capitalizes on advances in radar rainfall detection.

The 5th edition of the text should provide the engineering or science
stu- dent with all the necessary theory to understand principles of
hydrology, hydrologic modeling, floodplain hydraulics and analysis, and
water resources in the modern digital world. The student or practicing
engineer should find the book a useful reference for hydrologic methods,
current models, design examples, and extensively documented case
studies. In addition, simple calculations and spreadsheet examples are
utilized and highlighted in numerous places in the 5th edition, which
contains over 80 worked examples, over 220 homework problems, and 6
major case studies.

> The World Wide Web offers many opportunities for access to regional
> data with minimal cost and effort (see Appendix E), but the U.S.
> Geological Survey, National Weather Service, National Resources
> Conservation Service,
>
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other state and local agencies
> should be emphasized for students as likely sources of regional
> hydrologic data.
>
> The text includes a Companion website *hydrology.rice.edu* where
> updates and information can be found regarding the 5th edition. Dr.
> Bedi- ent maintains the site that contains selected problems, example
> datasets,
>
> **AUDIENCE AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES**
>
> simple Excel programs, and dozens of PowerPoint presentations that are
> available to any instructors and students in the course at no charge.
> These resources are designed to improve the teaching of a hydrology
> course at either the undergraduate or graduate level. A detailed
> solutions manual with updated problems is available for the 5th
> edition. The solutions man- ual for the International Edition can be
> accessed at www.pearsoninterna- tionaleditions.com/bedient.

> **INTRODUCTION TO HYDROLOGY**

**15**

> The **hydrologic cycle** is a continuous process in which water is
> evapo- rated from water surfaces and the oceans, moves inland as moist
> air masses, and produces precipitation if the correct vertical lifting
> conditions exist. The precipitation that falls from clouds onto the
> land surface of the earth is dis- persed to the hydrologic cycle via
> several pathways (Fig. 1--1). A portion of the **precipitation** *P*,
> or rainfall, is retained on the soil near where it falls and returns
> to the atmosphere via **evaporation** *E*, the conversion of water to
> water vapor from a water surface, and **transpiration** *T*, the loss
> of water vapor through plant tissue and leaves. The combined loss,
> called **evapotrans- piration** *ET*, is a maximum value if the water
> supply in the soil is adequate at all times. These parameters are
> further discussed in subsequent sections of this chapter and Section
> 2.6.
>
> Some water enters the soil system as **infiltration** *F*, which is a
> function of soil moisture conditions and soil type, and may reenter
> channels later as interflow or may percolate to recharge the shallow
> ground water. **Ground water** *G* flows in porous media in the
> subsurface in either shallow or deeper aquifer systems that can be
> pumped for water supply to agricultural and municipal water systems
> (see Chapter 8).
>
> The remaining portion of precipitation becomes overland flow or
> **direct runoff** *R*, which flows generally in a down-gradient
> direction to accu- mulate in local streams that then flow to rivers.
> Hydrologic analysis to deter- mine runoff response from a watershed
> area is covered in Chapter 2. Evaporation and infiltration are both
> complex losses from input rainfall and are difficult to measure or
> compute from theoretical methods, covered in detail in Sections 2.6,
> 2.7, and 2.8.

> Surface and ground waters flow from higher elevations toward lower
> elevations and may eventually discharge into the ocean, especially
> after large rainfall events (Fig. 1--1a). However, large quantities of
> surface water and portions of ground water return to the atmosphere by
> evaporation or *ET*, thus completing the natural hydrologic cycle
> (Fig. 1--1b). Precipitation from the atmosphere is a major force that
> drives the hydrologic cycle, and under- standing major weather

> **Ancient History**
>
> Biswas (1972), in a concise treatment of the history of hydrology,
> describes the early water management practices of the Sumerians and
> Egyptians in the Middle East and the Chinese along the banks of the
> Huang He (Yellow River). Archeological evidence exists for hydraulic
> structures that were built for irrigation and other water control
> activities. A dam was built across the Nile about 4000
> [b]{.smallcaps}.c., and later a canal for fresh water was constructed
> between Cairo and Suez.
>
> The Greek philosophers were the first serious students of hydrology,
> with Aristotle proposing the conversion of moist air into water deep
> inside mountains as the source of springs and streams. Homer suggested
> the idea

> of an underground sea as the source of all surface waters. The Romans
> con- structed numerous aqueducts to serve large cities as well as
> small towns and industrial sites. The Romans had the largest
> collection with water being sup- plied by 11 aqueducts constructed
> over a period of about 500 years. Figure 1--2 shows one of the famous
> aqueducts built in France during that early period. They served
> potable water and supplied the numerous baths and fountains in the
> city, as well as finally being emptied into the sewers, where the
> once-used gray water performed their last function in removing wastes.
> The construction of the Roman aqueducts is considered one of the most
> important engineering feats in history.
>
> Streamflow measurement techniques were first attempted in the water
> systems of Rome (a.d. 97) based on the cross-sectional area of flow.
> It remained for Leonardo da Vinci to discover the proper relationship
> between area, velocity, and flow rate during the Italian Renaissance.
> The first recorded measurement of rainfall and surface flow was made
> in the seven- teenth century by Perrault. He compared measured
> rainfall to the estimated flow of the Seine River to show the two were
> related. Perrault's findings were published in 1694. Halley, the
> English astronomer (1656--1742), used a small pan to estimate
> evaporation from the Mediterranean Sea and con- cluded that it was
> enough to account for tributary flows. Mariotte gaged the velocity of
> flow in the Seine River in Paris. These early beginnings of the
> science of hydrology provided the foundation for numerous advances in
> the eighteenth century, including Bernoulli's theorem, the Pitot tube
> for measur- ing velocity, and the Chezy (1769) formula, which form the
> basis for modern hydraulics and fluid measurement.
>
> During the nineteenth century, significant advances in ground water
> hydrology and hydraulics occurred. Darcy's law for flow in porous
> media was a major advance, as well as the Dupuit--Thiem well flow
> formula (Chapter 8). In addition, the Hagen--Poiseuille capillary flow
> equation was developed to describe flow in small channels. The
> Darcy-Weisbach equa- tion for pipe flow was also developed during this
> same period in the 1850s. In surface water hydrology, many flow
> formulas and measuring instruments
>
> were developed that allowed for the beginning of systematic stream
> gaging. In 1867, discharge measurements were organized on the Rhine
> River at Basel and quickly expanded throughout Europe.
>
> The U.S. Geological Survey set up the first systematic program of flow
> measurement in the United States on the Mississippi in 1888. During
> this same period, the United States founded a number of hydrologic
> agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1802), the U.S.
> Geological Survey (USGS, 1879), the Weather Bureau (1891), and the
> Mississippi River Commission (1893). The Price current meter was
> invented in 1885, and Man- ning's formula was introduced in 1889
> (Manning, 1889). The Weather Bureau is now called the National Weather
> Service (NWS) and is one of six organizations underneath the National
> Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration (NOAA). NOAA is the agency
> responsible for weather data collec- tion and severe-storm, river, and
> hurricane forecasting for the United States, and many of its websites
> are listed throughout the textbook. The USGS gag- ing network for
> rainfall, streamflow, and water quality is one of the most extensive
> in the world.
>
> **Early History (1930s--1950s)**
>
> The period from 1930 to 1950, which Chow (1964) called the Period of
> Ratio- nalization, produced a significant step forward for the field
> of hydrology, as government agencies began to develop their own
> programs of hydrologic research. Sherman's unit hydrograph (1932) (see
> Chapter 2), Horton's infil- tration theory (1933), and Theis's
> nonequilibrium equation (1935) in well hydraulics (Chapter 8) advanced
> the state of hydrology in very significant ways. Gumbel (1958)
> proposed the use of extreme-value distributions for frequency analysis
> of hydrologic data, thus forming the basis for modern statistical
> hydrology (Chapter 3). In this period, the U.S. Army Corps of
> Engineers (ACOE), the NWS within NOAA, the U.S. Department of Agri-
> culture (USDA), and the USGS made significant contributions in
> hydrologic theory and the development of a national network of gages
> for precipitation, evaporation, and streamflow measurements. The NWS
> is still largely respon- sible for rainfall measurements, reporting
> and forecasting of severe storms, and other related hydrologic
> investigations.
>
> The U.S. ACOE and the USDA Soil Conservation Service (now called the
> Natural Resources Conservation Service \[NRCS\]) made significant con-
> tributions to the field of hydrology in relation to flood control,
> reservoir development, irrigation, and soil conservation during this
> period. More recently, the USGS has taken significant strides to set
> up a national network of stream gages and rainfall gages for both
> quantity and quality data. Their water supply publications and special
> investigations have done much to advance the field of hydrology by
> presenting the analysis of complex hydro- logic data to develop
> relationships and explain hydrologic processes. The NWS and USGS both
> support numerous websites for the dissemination of watershed
> information and precipitation and streamflow data from thousands
>
> of gages around the country. Many of these sites are listed in
> Appendix E and on the textbook website
> ([http://hydrology.rice.edu/bedient).](http://hydrology.rice.edu/bedient))
>
> The government agencies in the United States have long performed vital
> research themselves, providing funding for private and university
> research in the hydrologic area. Many of the water resources studies
> and large dam, reservoir, and flood control projects in the 1930s and
> 1940s were a direct result of advances in the fields of fluid
> mechanics, hydrologic sys- tems, statistical hydrology, evaporation
> analysis, flood routing, and opera- tions research. Many of the
> advances from that era continue to this day as the methods to predict
> runoff, infiltration, and evaporation have not changed much in over 50
> years. Major contributions from Horton (1933, 1940, 1941) and from
> Penman (1948) in understanding hydrologic losses were related to the
> water and irrigation needs of the agricultural sector in the United
> States following the devastation of the dust bowl era of the 1930s.
>
> Major water resources projects built during the 1930s were a direct
> result of major floods on the Mississippi River and the economic
> depression across the nation. The building of the massive Hoover Dam
> on the Colorado River for flood and sediment control and water supply
> in the early 1930s provided employment for over 40,000 and was the
> largest construction proj- ect ever conceived to that point (see
> Chapters 12 and 13).
>
> **Modern History**
>
> In the 1950s and 1960s, the tremendous increase of urbanization
> following World War II in the United States and Europe led to better
> methods for predicting peak flows from floods, for understanding
> impacts from urban expansion, and for addressing variations in storage
> in water supply reservoirs. Major expansion of cities and water
> systems within the United States during the 1950s led to a need for
> better understanding of floods and droughts, especially in urban
> areas. Water resource studies became an everyday occur- rence in many
> rapidly developing areas of the United States, tied to the expansion
> of population centers in the southern, southwestern, and western
> states. Hydrologic analyses presented in detail in Chapters 2 through
> 9 in the text were a major component of many of these studies.
>
> During the 1970s and early 1980s, the evaluation and delineation of
> floodplain boundaries became a major function of hydrologists, as
> required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local
> flood control or drainage districts. In order for communities to be
> eligible for flood insurance administered by FEMA, they are required
> to delineate floodplain boundaries using hydrologic analysis and
> models. Floodplain analysis is cov- ered in detail in Chapters 5, 7,
> 9, and 12. This function has taken on a vital role in many urban
> areas, as damages from severe floods and hurricanes continue to plague
> the United States, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. The
> period from 2004 to 2010 accounted for numerous hurricanes that caused
> massive damages and deaths in several areas, especially along the
>
> coastlines of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The
> mas- sive Mississippi flood of 1993 wreaked havoc within the central
> United States, and was repeated in 2011 with major devastation to
> states from Illi- nois south to Louisiana (Chapter 12).
>
> In recent years, the traditional approaches to flood control have been
> reassessed. A study titled "Higher Ground" from the National Wildlife
> Fed- eration (1998) found a number of communities with large numbers
> of repet- itive flood losses, such as New Orleans and Houston. Since
> the great midwestern flood of 1993, there has been a significant shift
> in national flood policy away from using only structural solutions,
> such as levee and channel construction. Flood damage from Tropical
> Storm Allison in Houston in 2001 was a major wake-up call for better
> protection and warning systems in criti- cal urban areas. The massive
> devastation from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in August 2005 and
> Hurricane Ike in 2008 in Houston-Galveston will provide long-lasting
> incentive to improve our ability to warn for and recover from such
> severe storms. Modern methods for structural flood con- trol, as well
> as nonstructural approaches, better management of flood-prone areas,
> and voluntary property buyouts, must be considered in any overall
> flood management plan (Chapter 12). Chapter 13 explores several major
> water resources projects across the United States and Asia in terms of
> engi- neering significance as well as associated environmental and
> policy impacts on the nation.
>
> **Computer Advances**
>
> The introduction of the digital computer into hydrology during the
> 1960s and 1970s allowed complex water problems to be simulated as
> complete systems for the first time. Large computer models can now be
> used to match historical data and help answer difficult hydrologic
> questions (Singh and Frevert, 2006). The development of these tools
> over the past few decades has helped direct the collection of the
> hydrologic data to calibrate, or "match," the models against
> observation. In the process, the understanding of the hydrologic
> system has been greatly advanced. Hydrologic computer models developed
> in the 1970s have been applied to areas previously unstud- ied or only
> empirically defined. For example, urban stormwater, floodplain and
> watershed hydrology, drainage design, reservoir design and operation,
> flood frequency analysis, and large-river basin management have all
> bene- fited from the application of computer models.
>
> Hydrologic simulation models applied to watershed analysis are
> described in detail in Chapter 5. Single-event models such as HEC-HMS
> are used to simulate or calculate the resulting storm hydrograph
> (discharge vs. time) from a well-defined watershed area for a given
> pattern of rainfall intensity. Continuous models such as the
> Hydrological Simulation Pro- gram---Fortran (HSPF) and the Storm Water
> Management Model (SWMM) can account for soil moisture storage,
> evapotranspiration, and antecedent
>
> rainfall over long time periods. Statistical models can be used to
> generate a time series of rainfall or streamflow data, which can then
> be analyzed with flood frequency methods.
>
> Newer distributed hydrologic models (i.e., VFLO and the MIKE series of
> models) can handle input, output, and data manipulation at the
> watershed level (see Chapters 5, 10, 11, and 12). Unquestionably new
> digital approaches combined with distributed terrain modeling have
> revolutionized hydrology in recent years, just as the original wave of
> models did in the decade of the 1970s. Also faster computers and
> available datasets have been instrumental in advancing the field.
>
> The data revolution in hydrology and geographical information sys-
> tems (GIS) have made available newer and more accurate datasets on
> topog- raphy, slope, rainfall, soils, land use, and channel
> characteristics for many areas. Moreover, most hydrological and
> meteorological data may be retrieved online from agencies such as the
> USGS and NWS, and various county and municipal sources. These
> datasets, combined with existing simu- lation models in hydrology, if
> applied correctly, provide the most accurate approach to understanding
> complex water resources systems, and a new era in the science of
> hydrology has begun this decade. New design and operating policies are
> being advanced and implemented that could not have been real- ized or
> tested before without the aid of sophisticated computer models linked
> with digital data.

> **WEATHER SYSTEMS**
>
> The atmosphere is the major hydrologic link between oceans and
> continents on the planet, facilitating the cycle of water movement on
> earth. The hydro- logic cycle is shaped by the conditions of the
> atmosphere, with precipitation as the main input to the cycle. Water
> vapor content is both a major catalyst and a balancing factor of
> atmospheric processes that create the weather in the lower atmosphere.
> The following section reviews major elements of atmospheric processes
> that directly impact the hydrologic cycle. More details on atmospheric
> processes can be found in modern meteorology and hydrol- ogy textbooks
> (Anthes, 1997; Ahrens, 2000; Dingman, 2002).
>
> **Atmospheric Parameters**
>
> Pressure is defined as the force per unit area exerted on a surface,
> and **atmo- spheric pressure** measures the weight of the air per unit
> area. Average air pressure at sea level is approximately 1 atmosphere,
> or 1013 millibars (mb) or 14.7 lb/in.^2^ or 760 mm-Hg or 29.97 in.-Hg.
> Note that 1 mb = 10^2^ pascals (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 N/m^2^. As
> elevation increases and the density of air molecules decreases,
> atmospheric pressure also decreases. The horizontal and vertical
> pressure variations that occur due to low- and high-pressure systems
> are responsible for wind, and help drive much of our weather. Abso-
> lute temperature (*T*), pressure (*P*), and density 1r2 are related
> through the
>
> ideal gas law, *P* = r*RT*, where *R* is the gas constant for the gas
> in question (see Eq. 1--1). At constant density, temperature is
> directly proportional to pressure; thus, with an increase in
> temperature comes an increase in pres- sure. Air pressure is
> proportional to density, so that in the atmosphere a decrease in
> temperature causes an increase in the density of the air mole- cules.
> Cold air masses are generally associated with the higher atmospheric
> pressure.
>
> **Humidity** is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the
> atmosphere and can be expressed in several ways. Specific humidity is
> the mass of water vapor in a unit mass of moist air. The **relative
> humidity** is a ratio of the air's actual water vapor content compared
> to the amount of water vapor at satu- ration for that temperature. The
> partial pressure of water vapor is the con- tribution made by water to
> the total atmospheric pressure. When a volume reaches its maximum
> capacity for water vapor, the volume is said to be satu- rated and can
> accept no more vapor. This vapor pressure is known as **satura- tion
> vapor pressure**. Vapor pressure is dependent on temperature; and as
> air is lifted and cools, its relative humidity increases until
> saturation, and then condensation of water vapor to liquid water can
> occur. The temperature to which a sample of air must be cooled to
> reach saturation is defined as the **dew point temperature**. These
> concepts are described in more detail later in this section.
>
> Water vapor has the ability, unique among gases, to change from one
> state of matter to another (solid, liquid, or gas) at the temperatures
> and pressures that typically exist on earth. A change in phase (e.g.,
> from liquid to vapor) requires that heat be released or absorbed. The
> processes of con- verting solid ice to liquid water, called melting,
> and water to vapor, called evaporation, both require significant heat
> exchange. It takes approximately 600 cal to convert 1 g of water to
> water vapor. When such changes take place, the heat is absorbed and no
> temperature change takes place. The heat used in this process is
> latent heat. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes
> into a liquid state. For this to occur, energy must be released in an
> amount equivalent to what was absorbed during evaporation. This latent
> heat often becomes the source of energy for severe thunderstorms,
> tornadoes, and hurricanes.
>
> **The Atmosphere and Clouds**
>
> Atmospheric weather systems are fueled by solar input and
> characterized by air masses in motion, circulating winds, cloud
> generation, and changes in tem- perature and pressure. Lifting
> mechanisms are required for moist air masses to cool and approach
> saturation conditions. As a result of the interaction of rising air
> masses with atmospheric moisture, the presence of small atmospheric
> nuclei, and droplet growth, precipitation in the form of rain, snow,
> or hail can result. The exact mechanisms that lead to precipitation
> are sometimes quite complex and difficult to predict for specific
> areas. But precipitation remains
>
> as the main input to the hydrologic cycle, and the hydrologist needs a
> general understanding of the mechanisms that cause its formation.
>
> Horizontal variations in atmospheric pressure cause air to move from
> higher pressure toward lower pressure, resulting in the generation of
> wind. Vertical displacement causes air to move as well, but at a far
> slower rate than horizontal winds. The vertical movement and lifting
> of air results in the formation of clouds. Clouds are familiar to all
> of us, and represent collec- tions of small droplets of water or tiny
> crystals of ice. The names of the basic clouds have the following
> roots:
>
> **cirrus**, feathery or fibrous clouds
>
> **stratus**, layered clouds
>
> **cumulus**, towering, puffy clouds **alto**, middle-level clouds
> **nimbus**, rain clouds
>
> The second aspect of cloud classification is by height. Anthes (1997)
> presents a detailed coverage of cloud types for the interested
> student. One type of high cloud of importance in hydrology is the
> **cumulonimbus**, one often found in heavy thunderstorms that produce
> massive rainfall. Cirrus clouds are very high collections of ice
> crystals and often indicate the approach of a cold front and that
> weather is about to change. While clouds result when air rises and
> cools, surface fog results from cooling near the surface or from the
> addition of enough water vapor to cause saturation. Fog is essentially
> a low cloud with a base that is very near the ground, often reducing
> the visibil- ity in the area within or around it. Marine fog is common
> along the Califor- nia and upper Atlantic coasts in the United States.
>
> **General Circulation**
>
> The general circulation of wind across the earth is caused by the
> uneven heating of earth's surface through solar input, and by the
> earth's rotation. At the equator, solar radiation input and
> temperature are greatest because of the shape and tilt of the globe
> relative to the sun. Three latitudinal circu- lation cells transport
> heat from the equator to the poles (Fig. 1--3). As warm air travels
> northward in the middle latitudinal cell on a spinning earth, it tends
> to shift to the right (toward the east) in the northern hemisphere due
> to the Coriolis force, thus causing the occurrence of winds called
> **westerlies**. These winds tend to drive the direction of major
> weather systems from west to east across major portions of the
> continental United States.
>
> Between 30 degrees north latitude and the equator, the flow is
> generally toward the south and is altered to create the trade winds
> (**easterlies**) by the Coriolis force in the northern hemisphere. The
> trade winds allowed explorers from Europe to sail across the ocean to
> the New World. The Coriolis force causes the flow along latitude
> circles (east/west) to be 10 times greater than

> the flow along the meridians (north/south). Around the 30 degrees
> north and south latitudes, descending air creates a region of minimal
> winds and little cloudiness that is known as the horse latitudes. Near
> the equator is another region of light and variable winds called the
> doldrums, or the intertropical convergence zone. This is the area of
> maximum solar heating, where surface air rises and flows toward both
> poles.
>
> **Jet streams**, first observed in 1946, are narrow bands of
> high-speed winds that circle each hemisphere like great rivers, at
> elevations extending from 2.5 or 3 miles to above the tropopause. The
> polar and subtropical jets are associated with the polar front near 45
> degrees latitude and 30 degrees latitude, respectively. The jet
> streams are highly variable and can flow at speeds as high as 100 mph
> faster than the air on either side of them. Jet streams have a major
> impact as the driving force for weather systems across the United
> States, especially in the winter season.
>
> **Air Masses and Fronts**
>
> Air masses are large bodies of air with fairly consistent temperature
> and humidity gradients in the horizontal direction at a given
> altitude. Air masses dominate our weather and are classified in two
> ways: the source from which
>
> they were generated, land (continental) or water (maritime), and the
> latitude of generation (polar or tropical). The four combinations are
> designated cP, cT, mP, and mT.
>
> Each of these types of air masses is present in the United States. The
> continental polar air mass emanates from Canada and passes over the
> north- ern United States, often dropping significant amounts of rain
> and snow on areas downwind of the Great Lakes. The maritime polar air
> mass also comes southward from the Atlantic coast of Canada and
> affects the New England states. Another maritime polar air mass comes
> from the Pacific and hits the extreme northwestern states. The
> maritime tropical air masses come from the Pacific, the Gulf of
> Mexico, and the Atlantic. The entire southern United States is
> affected by these air masses. The only time continental tropical air
> masses form is during the summer, and they originate in Texas and
> affect the states bordering to the north.
>
> The boundary between one air mass and another is called a frontal
> zone, or **front**. When two air masses meet, the front will slope
> diagonally, as the colder, denser air mass pushes under the warmer air
> mass. Between the two fronts, a transition zone occurs, usually 30 to
> 60 miles wide. Whether the masses are traveling against each other or
> in the same direction, the warmer air mass will be forced upward and
> cooled by expansion. Since cooling a parcel of air lowers its
> saturation vapor pressure, this may cause condensa- tion and the
> development of precipitation often associated with frontal sys- tems
> (Fig. 1--4). The NWS website provides an amazing amount of weather
> information and satellite data all on one place
> ([http://www.nws.noaa.gov/).](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/))

> Direction of the cold and warm fronts in the eastern United States.
> The cold fronts come from the North toward the Gulf and the warm

>
> Development of surface cyclones along fronts occurs when an upper-
> level disturbance approaches a front. The upper-level patterns of
> conver- gence and divergence produce pressure changes at the surface,
> which then produce low-level circulation (**wave cyclone**). As a wave
> cyclone develops, low pressure forms at its apex and both the warm and
> cold currents move in a cyclonic pattern (counterclockwise in the
> northern hemisphere) around it. To the left of the apex, the cold
> front is advancing towards the warm air, and the warm front is
> receding to the right. The warm air between the fronts is known as the
> warm sector. The entire system generally moves toward the right
> (eastward), and ahead of the warm front the first sign of the
> approach- ing system is high cirrus clouds. As the center of low
> pressure approaches, the pressure falls and the wind increases and
> changes its direction to coun- terclockwise. The temperature begins to
> decrease as the frontal zone approaches. Within several hundred miles
> of the surface position of the front, precipitation begins, either
> rain or snow. Fronts can be fast moving in the winter or can be slowed
> or stalled due to the presence of other air masses or high-pressure
> systems in the fall or spring (Anthes, 1997). Warm fronts can also
> generate rainfalls as they move across an area.
>
> Fronts are a major factor in U.S. weather patterns, especially from
> September through April in most years. The type of weather
> accompanying the passage of the cold front depends on the front's
> sharpness, its speed, and the stability of the air being forced aloft.
> Often there are towering cumulus clouds and showers along the forward
> edge of the front. Sometimes, espe- cially in the Midwest during the
> spring, several **squalls**, or a strong line of storms, precede the
> front. Tornadoes can form in these storm cells, especially in areas of
> north Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. But in other cases, nim-
> bostratus clouds and rain extend over a zone of 50 to 60 miles. After
> the frontal passage, the wind changes sharply and the pressure begins
> to rise. Within a short distance behind the cold front, the weather
> clears, the tem- perature begins to fall, and the visibility greatly
> improves.

> **Thunderstorms**
>
> Thunderstorm activity is characterized by cumulonimbus clouds that can
> produce heavy rainfall, thunder, lightning, and occasionally hail.
> Thunder- storms are the result of strong vertical movements in the
> atmosphere and usually occur in the spring or summer in the United
> States. They require warm, moist air, which when lifted will release
> enough latent heat to provide the buoyancy needed to maintain its
> upward motion. Accordingly, they gen- erally occur in warm air masses
> that have become unstable either through extreme low-pressure systems,
> surface heating, or forced ascent over moun- tains. The geographic
> pattern of thunderstorm occurrence in the United States is a result of
> both an area's distance from source air masses and its topography.
> Florida and the Gulf Coast are affected most frequently, some- times
> as often as 100 times in a year.

> The Cumulonimbus cloud that signals that a storm is approaching.
>
> Thunderstorms develop in three characteristic stages. The first is the
> cumulus stage, when moist air rises and cools and condenses into a
> cumulus cloud. The cumulus cloud then continues to grow taller as the
> rising air condenses at successively higher levels (Fig. 1--5). The
> diameter of the storm cell grows in width from about 1 mile to 6 to 9
> miles and vertically to 5 or 6 miles. The rising air is no longer able
> to retain water droplets and rain begins to fall.
>
> The rain marks the beginning of the second stage of the thunder-
> storm, the mature stage. During the mature stage, the large water
> particles or hail in the clouds begin to fall because they have become
> too large to be supported by the updraft. As this happens, drier air
> around the cloud is being drawn into it, in a process known as
> entrainment. This drying of the air results in the evaporation of some
> rain drops, which cools the air. The air is now colder and heavier
> than the air around it and, while the upper part of the cloud still
> has a strong updraft, a lower part of the storm cloud begins to
> descend as a downdraft. This downdraft eventually reaches the ground
> and spreads away from the thunderstorm, causing the cool gusts of wind
> that usually foreshadow the arrival of a thunderstorm. Meanwhile, the
> upper part of the cloud reaches a stable part of the atmosphere, and
> high-altitude winds may create a typical anvil shape (Fig. 1--6). The
> cloud reaches its greatest vertical development in this stage,
> extending upward over 7.5 mi (40,000 ft, 12 km). Lightning,
> turbulence, heavy rains, and, if present, hail are all found at this
> time. The second stage is the most intense period of the thunderstorm.
>
> When the downdraft has spread over the entire storm cell and the
> updraft has been cut off, the storm begins its final stage, the
> dissipating stage. The rate of precipitation diminishes and so the
> downdrafts are also gradually subdued. The final flashes of lightning

> **Hurricanes**
>
> **Tropical cyclones** or **hurricanes** are intense cyclonic storms
> that form over the tropical oceans, between 5 and 20 degrees latitude.
> With extreme amounts of rainfall and winds that can exceed 186 mph
> (300 km/hr), trop- ical cyclones are the most destructive storms on
> earth. The local name for this storm varies throughout the world:
> typhoon in Eastern Asia, cyclone in India, and baguio in the China
> Sea. The North American term, used in this discussion, is hurricane.
> By international agreement, a storm is a hur- ricane if it has wind
> speeds of at least 74 mph (119 km/hr) and a rotary circulation. When
> its wind speeds are between 39 mph (63 km/hr) and 73 mph (119 km/hr),
> it is a tropical storm. Tropical disturbances with winds that do not
> exceed 39 mph (61 km/hr) are tropical depressions. All tropical storms
> and hurricanes are given proper names in alphabetical order, start-
> ing at the beginning of the alphabet when the storm season begins on
> June 1 and starting over during the next season. Hurricanes are
> classified accord- ing to a scale based on central pressure, storm
> surge height, and wind speed. The scale has five categories, ranging
> from category 1, a hurricane of minimal damage, to category 5, a
> hurricane of catastrophic proportions (see Table 1--1).

> The warm, moisture-laden air of the tropical oceans possesses an enor-

> condensation from vapor to water. Hurricanes develop most often during
> the late summer when the oceans are warm (26°C or higher) and are thus
> able to provide the necessary heat and moisture to the air. The
> hurricane season in the West Indies extends from June 1 to November 1,

> **Moisture Relationships**
>
> Atmospheric moisture is a necessary source for precipitation and is
> generally provided from evaporation and transpiration. Precipitation
> across the United States is largely due to proximity of evaporation
> from oceans and the Gulf of Mexico and to subsequent transport over
> the continent by the atmo- spheric circulation system. Common measures
> of atmospheric moisture, or humidity, include vapor pressure, specific
> humidity, mixing ratio, relative humidity, and dew point temperature.
> (Most of these terms were defined earlier in the chapter.) Under moist
> conditions, water vapor can be assumed to obey the ideal gas law,
> which allows derivation of simple relations between pressure, density,
> and temperature.
>
> The partial pressure is the pressure that would be exerted on the sur-
> face of a container by a particular gas in a mixture. The partial
> pressure exerted by water vapor is called **vapor pressure** and can
> be derived from Dalton's law and the ideal gas law as

>
> *R* = dry air gas constant = 2.87 \* 10^3^ mb cm^3^/g°K,
>
> *T* = absolute temperature (°K).
>
> The factor 0.622 arises from the ratio of the molecular weight of
> water (18) to that of air (29). Near the earth's surface, the water
> vapor pressure is 1% to 2% of the total atmospheric pressure, where
> average atmospheric pres- sure is 1013.2 mb (1 mb = 10^2^ pascals
> (Pa)). **Saturation vapor pressure** is the partial pressure of water
> vapor when the air is completely saturated (no further evaporation
> occurs) and is a function of temperature.
>
> **Relative humidity** (*RH*) is approximately the ratio of water vapor
> pressure to that which would prevail under saturated conditions at the
> same temperature. It can also be stated as *RH* = 100 *e*\>*e~s~*.
> Thus, 50% relative humidity means that the atmosphere contains 50% of
> the maximum moisture it could hold under saturated conditions at that
> temperature. Typical relative humidity averages (high and low
> percentages) for eight major American cities are as follows: Houston
> (89, 67), Seattle (84, 62), Chicago (80, 64), New York
>

>
> In order for vapor to condense to water to begin the formation of
> precipita- tion, a quantity of heat known as latent heat must be
> removed from the moist air. The **latent heat** of condensation *L~c~*
> is equal to the latent heat of evapora- tion *L~e~*, the amount of
> heat required to convert water to vapor at the same temperature. With
> *T* measured in °C,
>
> *L~e~* = - *L~c~* = 597.3 - 0.57(*T* - 0°C), (1--5)

> also related:
>
> *L~m~* = - *L~f~* = 79.7,
>
> where *L~m~* is also in cal/g. Thus, it takes about 7.5 times the
> energy to evapo- rate a gram of water compared to melting a gram of
> ice.
>
> As moist, unsaturated air rises, the relative humidity increases, and
> at some elevation saturation is reached and relative humidity becomes
> 100%. Fur- ther cooling of the air results in condensation of the
> moisture at a defined lifting condensation level (LCL). Latent heat of
> condensation is released, warming the air and lowering the atmospheric
> lapse rate, or the rate of temperature change with elevation. As
> discussed earlier, latent heat exchange is the major energy source
> that fuels tropical cyclones and hurricanes. It has also been observed
> that a relation does not necessarily exist between the amount of water
> vapor and the resulting precipitation over a region. Thus,
> condensation can occur in cloud formations without the production of
> precipitation at the ground surface.
>
> Meteorologists use the moisture relationships and the latent-heat con-
> cepts to obtain pressure--temperature relationships for cooling of
> rising moist air in the atmosphere. The rate of temperature change
> with elevation in the atmosphere is called the **adiabatic lapse
> rate**. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR) is 9.8°C per km and
> assumes no phase changes of water. The average ambient lapse rate is
> about 6.5°C per km, but varies with moisture conditions. An unstable
> atmosphere is one in which the ambient lapse rate is greater than the
> DALR. A stable atmosphere is one in which the ambient lapse rate is
> less than the DALR, and an air parcel tends to cool faster than the
> environment as it rises vertically. Figure 1--8 shows the variation of
> lapse rates and different types of atmospheric conditions, with an
> unstable atmo- sphere being very conducive to lifting of moist air and
> to formation of severe weather and/or rainfall conditions.

2.  **cyclonic,** associated with the movement of large air-mass
    > systems, as in the case of warm or cold fronts; and

3.  **orographic,** due to mechanical lifting of moist air masses over
    > the windward side of mountain ranges.

> Orographic precipitation is caused by mechanical lifting of moist air
> over mountain ranges. Notable examples include the western side of the
> Cascade Mountains, the western side of the Andes in Chile, and the
> western coast of Norway. On the lee side of mountain barriers are dry
> areas, called rain shadows, since most of the moisture is dropped as
> rain or snow over the mountain ranges. Good examples of rain shadows
> can be found east of the Cascades in Washington and Oregon and east of
> the Sierra Nevada range in California (see Fig. 1--10).
>
> **Condensation** of water vapor into cloud droplets occurs due to
> cooling of moist air to a temperature below the saturation point for
> water vapor. This is most commonly achieved through vertical lifting
> to levels where pressure and temperature are lower. A large portion of
> the atmospheric mass lies within 18,000 ft of the surface and contains
> most of the clouds and moisture. Condensation can be caused by (1)
> adiabatic cooling (no heat loss to sur- roundings), (2) mixing of air
> masses having different temperatures, (3) cool- ing by advection of
> cold air masses, and (4) cooling by radiation. Adiabatic cooling is by
> far the most important producer of appreciable precipitation.

> Small condensation nuclei must be present for the formation of cloud
> droplets. Such nuclei come from many sources, such as ocean salt, dust
> from clay soils, industrial combustion products, and volcanoes, and
> they range in size from 0.1 m to 10 m. Cloud droplets originally
> average 0.01 mm in diam- eter, and it is only when they exceed 0.5 mm
> that significant precipitation occurs. It may take hours for a small
> raindrop (1 mm) to grow on a conden- sation nucleus. As vapor-laden
> air rises, it cools as it expands; and as satura- tion occurs, water
> vapor begins to condense on the most active nuclei. The principal
> mechanism for the supply of water to the growing droplet in early
> stages is diffusion of water-vapor molecules down the vapor-pressure
> gradi- ent toward the droplet surface. As the droplets increase in
> mass, they begin to move relative to the overall cloud. However, other
> processes must support the growth of droplets of sufficient size
> (0.5--3.0 mm) to overcome air resis- tance and to fall as
> precipitation. These include the coalescence process and the
> ice-crystal process.
>
> The **coalescence process** is considered dominant in summer shower
> precipitation. As water droplets fall, the smaller ones are overtaken
> by larger ones, and droplet size is increased through collision. This
> can produce significant precipitation, especially in warm cumulus
> clouds in tropical regions. The **ice-crystal process** attracts
> condensation on freezing nuclei because of lower vapor pressures. The
> ice crystals grow in size through contact with other particles, and
> collisions cause snowflakes to form. Snow- flakes may change into rain
> droplets after entering air in which the tem- perature is above
> freezing. Snowfall and snowmelt processes are presented in detail in
> Chapter 2.
>
> **Point Measurement**
>
> The main source of moisture for annual rainfall totals is evaporation
> from the oceans; thus, precipitation tends to be heavier near the
> coastlines, with distor- tion due to orographic effects---that is,
> effects of changes in elevation over mountain ranges. In general,
> amount and frequency of precipitation is greater on the windward side
> of mountain barriers (the western side for the United States) and less
> on the lee side (eastern side), also shown in Figure 1--10.
> Considerable amounts of precipitation data are available from the NWS,
> the USGS, and various local governmental agencies. A number of useful
> websites for precipitation data are listed in Appendix E and on the
> textbook website
> [http://hydrology.rice.edu.](http://hydrology.rice.edu/)
> Interpretation of national networks of rainfall data shows extreme
> variability in space and time, as can be seen in annual and monthly
> variations in Figures 1--10 and 1--11, respectively.
>
> Time variation of precipitation occurs seasonally or within a single
> storm, and distributions vary with storm type, intensity, duration,
> and time

(c) Isohyetal method

> are drawn between stations located on a map. Perpendicular bisectors
> are drawn to form polygons around each gage, and the ratio of the area
> of each polygon *A~i~* within the watershed boundary to the total area
> *A~T~* is used to weigh each station's rainfall. The method is unique
> for each gage network and does not allow for orographic effects (those
> due to elevation changes), but it is probably the most widely used of
> the three available methods.
>
> The **isohyetal method** \[Fig. 1--16(c)\] involves drawing contours
> of equal precipitation (isohyets) and is the most accurate method.
> However, an extensive gage network is required to draw isohyets
> accurately. The rainfall calculation is based on finding the average
> rainfall between each pair of contours, multiplying by the area
> between them, totaling these products, and dividing by the total area.
> The isohyetal method can include orographic effects and storm
> morphology and can represent an accurate map of the rainfall pattern,

> **SIMPLE RAINFALL-- RUNOFF**
>
> One of the simplest rainfall--runoff formulas, which is often used for
> drainage design purposes in small watersheds and/or basins, is the

> prediction of peak flow *Q~p~* (cfs) from the formula

where

> *Q~p~* = *CiA* (1--13)
>
> *C* = runoff coefficient, variable with land use,
>
> *i* = intensity of rainfall of chosen frequency for a duration equal

>
> *t~c~* = equilibrium time for rainfall occurring at the most remote
> portion of the basin to contribute flow at the outlet (min or hr),
>
> *A* = area of watershed (acres).
>
> The Rational Method is usually attributed to Kuichling (1889) and
> Lloyd- Davies (1906), but Mulvaney (1851) clearly outlined the
> procedure in a paper in Ireland. The underlying assumption is that a
> steady, uniform rainfall rate will produce maximum runoff when all
> parts of a watershed are contributing to out- flow, a condition that
> is met after the time of concentration *t~c~* has elapsed. Time of
> concentration *t~c~* is defined as the time for a wave of water to
> propagate from the most distant point in the basin to the outlet (see
> Section 2.1). Runoff is as- sumed to reach a maximum when the rainfall
> intensity lasts as long as the *t~c~*. The runoff coefficient is
> assumed constant during a storm event. More details can be found in

> systems, culverts, and open channels. Chapters 6 and 9 present
> detailed discussion and examples of the rational method applied to
> small watershed areas. Larger wa- tersheds (greater than a few square

**STREAMFLOW**

> The hydrologic cycle is shown as a schematic in Figure 1--1, where
> precipita- tion *P* initially falls on the land surface, and it may
> distribute to fill **depres- sion storage**, infiltrate to become soil
> moisture and shallow ground water, or travel as interflow to a
> receiving stream. Evaporation *E* is often a small component of a
> specific storm event, since it is minimal as rain is actually falling,
> and is usually only a factor in longer-term water balances. Depression
> storage capacity is usually satisfied early in storm passage, followed
> by infil- tration capacity into the soil (see Fig. 1--20). Eventually,
> overland flow and surface runoff commence after soil storage and
> depression storage are satis- fied. Overland flow then quickly moves
> down-gradient toward the nearest small rivulet or channel, which then

> The classic concept of streamflow generation by **overland flow** is

> heterogeneity, which exists across natural watersheds, and developed
> the partial area con- tribution concept (Betson, 1964). This model
> recognized that only certain portions of a watershed regularly
> contribute overland flow to streams and that no more than about 10% of
> a watershed contributes overland flow. In urban environments with
> large areas of impervious cover, the overland flow percentage may be
> larger. Significant surface runoff occurs only after rainfall
> intensity exceeds infiltration capacity, or (*i* 7 *f*) and soil
> moisture storage has been filled. Infiltration *f* is the loss rate
> into the soil system.
>
> The channel may contain a certain amount of **baseflow** coming from
> ground water and soil contributions even in the absence of rainfall.
> Discharge from rainfall excess, after infiltration losses have been
> subtracted, makes up the **direct-runoff hydrograph (DRO)**. The total
> storm hydrograph consists of direct runoff plus baseflow. The duration
> of rainfall determines the portion of watershed area contributing to
> the peak, and the intensity of rainfall deter- mines the resulting
> peak flow rate. If rainfall maintains a constant intensity for a very
> long time, maximum storage is achieved and a state of equilibrium dis-
> charge is reached, where the hydrograph tends to level off to a
> constant value for a period of time. The condition of equilibrium
> discharge is seldom attained over a large basin in nature because of
> the variability of actual rainfall.

> Chapters 6 and 9). As can be seen, the shape and timing of the
> hydrograph are largely related to watershed shape characteristics, and

> intensity. The contributions also depend on the level of **soil
> moisture storage** *S~D~* vs. **field capacity** *F* of the soil,
> which is defined as the amount of water held in place after excess

>
> However, the extreme case where both *i* 7 *f* and *F* 7 *S~D~* is
> typical of a large storm event in which direct surface runoff,
> interflow, and base flow all contribute to the hydrograph. In this
> case, the intensity of rainfall domi- nates the system, and large

> the response. In more forested and natural watersheds, infiltration
> and surface roughness may be major factors and significantly alter the
> hydrograph.
>
> Infiltration is one of the most complex of hydrologic phenomena. Hor-
> ton (1933) showed that when the rainfall rate *i* exceeds the
> infiltration rate *f*, water infiltrates the surface soils at a rate
> that generally decreases with time (Fig. 1--28). These rates are
> usually reported in inches per hour. For any given soil, a limiting

> **Recession and Base Flow Separation**
>
> It is generally customary to consider the hydrograph to be divided
> into only two parts: direct runoff (DRO) and base flow (BF), as shown
> in Figures 1--26 and 1--27. DRO may include some interflow, whereas
> base flow is considered to be mostly from contributing ground water.
> In most urban streams, base flow will be a relatively small component,
> usually less than a few percent, while it can be a significant
> component in a large river basin.
>
> Several techniques exist to separate DRO from base flow based on the

>
> where
>
> *q*~0~ = specified initial discharge, *q~t~* = discharge at a later

>
> Equations of this form are used often in engineering to describe
> first-order decay or depletion. Equation (1--14) will plot as a
> straight-line depletion curve on semilogarithmic paper, and the
> difference between this curve and
>
> the total hydrograph plotted on the same paper represents the DRO.
> Several storms should be used in order to develop a master depletion
> curve (Mc- Cuen, 2005). In practice, there are three simpler methods
> for handling base flow separation. The base flow recession can be
> extended forward under the peak of the hydrograph, starting with the
> point of lowest discharge and then extending at constant discharge to
> a point on the recession limb (*AD* in Fig. 1--27). The inflection
> point on the recession is assumed to be the point where the DRO ends.
> A second method is the concave method, where base flow is extended
> under the peak of the hydrograph and then is connected to the
> inflection point on the recession curve (*ABC*). Figure 1--27 shows
> two of the above methods. Computerized methods for base flow
> separation are also available (Sloto and Crouse, 1996).
>
> The separation methods all suffer the disadvantage of being arbitrary
> and somewhat inaccurate. At present, base flow separation is more an
> art than a science. In many cases of practical interest such as urban
> drainage, base flow is often neglected because it represents such a
> small component. Base flow is usually more important in natural
> streams and large rivers because of the contribution along the banks
> from a water table.

> **Net Storm Rainfall and the Hydrograph**
>
> Surface runoff phenomena have been discussed above, and the
> distribution of gross rainfall can be divided into components of
> infiltration, depression storage, detention storage, and direct
> runoff. We can write the continuity equation for this process as

> It is often important to determine the time distribution for rainfall

> rainfall excess include the Horton infiltration method and the f index
> method, with initial loss included for depression storage, as shown in

> rainfall and hydrograph vol- umes using various infiltration equations
> (i.e., compute in./hr over the water- shed area), as described in
> detail in Example 1.6. The Horton method estimates infiltration with

> **HYDROLOGIC MEASUREMENT**
>
> Hydrologic processes vary in space and time, and accurate measurement
> requires the use of sophisticated instruments, which are usually at a
> fixed location in space. The resulting data from rainfall,
> evaporation, or stream- flow levels measured over time create a time
> series, which may be further analyzed statistically. The overall
> sequence of steps for hydrologic measure- ment includes

1.  Sensing, which transforms the intensity of the process into a
    > measur- able signal;

2.  Recording, usually in electronic form;

3.  Transmitting to a central processing site via telemetry;

4.  Translating, which converts the record into a data sequence;

5.  Editing, or checking for any errors in the data;

6.  Storing, in a computer database for viewing;

7.  Retrieving the data for further use.

> The advent of advanced telemetry, radar systems, use of the Internet,
> and use of large database storage devices has revolutionized
> hydrologic informa- tion storage, retrieval, and distribution. A
> number of useful websites often used in hydrology for rainfall and
> streamflow data are listed in Appendix E.
>
> **Atmospheric Parameters and Precipitation**
>
> The measurement of atmospheric moisture near the ground often utilizes
> a climate station, which usually consists of a psychrometer (or
> hygrometer) to measure humidity, a rainfall gage, an evaporation pan,
> and an anemometer for wind speed and direction. Total incoming or
> outgoing radiation can be measured with a radiometer. Weather balloons
> are used to measure tem- perature, humidity, air pressure, and wind
> speed at various elevations above the earth.
>
> The fundamental instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure is the
> mercurial **barometer**, which is constructed by filling a long glass
> tube with mercury. The barometer acts as a weighing balance, and
> changes in atmo- spheric pressure are detected from changes in the
> height of the column of mercury. The **psychrometer** is an instrument
> based on temperature differ- ences between two thermometers, one of
> which is covered in a wet cloth, called the wet bulb. The difference
> in temperature of the dry and wet bulbs, when ventilated, is a measure
> of degree of saturation of the air, which is a measure of relative
> humidity.
>
> Precipitation or rainfall is measured at a point with either
> non-recording or recording gages. The non-recording gage consists of a
> simple open tube with readings along the side for visually determining
> rainfall amounts. Recording gages are required in urban settings for
> flood control studies if the time distribution of rainfall is desired.
> The tipping bucket recording gage operates off a pair of small buckets
> (Fig. 1--14a), which move in a flip-flop motion and make electrical
> contact for every increment of rainfall. The buck- ets direct water
> into a reservoir, which can be checked for cumulative totals at the
> end of a storm event. The gage usually records every 0.01 in. or 0.1
> in. of rain and telemeters this to a central computer for storage and
> analysis.
>
> **Radar** (radio detection and ranging) has been used to measure
> rainfall rates on the ground since 1994, and GIS methods have greatly
> improved our ability to determine rainfall rates for specific
> watershed areas. Chapter 11 presents more details.
>
> **Evaporation and Infiltration Losses**
>
> **Evaporation** is the process by which water in its liquid or solid
> state is trans- formed into water vapor, which mixes with the
> atmosphere. **Evapotranspi- ration** (*ET*) is considered separately
> as the combined loss of water vapor from the surface of plants
> (transpiration) and the evaporation of moisture from soil. Knowledge
> of evaporation processes is important in predicting water losses to
> evaporation from a lake or reservoir. On average, approxi- mately 70%
> of the mean annual rainfall in the United States is returned to the
> atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration. However, variations in
> evaporation across the continent can be very large due to effects of
> solar input, location of mountains, and proximity to oceans. On an
> annual basis, evaporation rates can exceed mean annual rainfall,
> especially in arid regions
>
> of the southwest. For example, arid areas in Texas, Arizona, New
> Mexico, Nevada, and southern California can exceed 70 inches per year,
> compared to about 30 to 40 inches per year for much of the rest of the
> country. For the case of evaporation from a lake surface, water loss
> is a function of solar radiation, temperature of the water and air,
> difference in vapor pressure between water and the overlying air, and
> wind speed across the lake.
>
> Evaporation is important in the long-term water balance and is usually
> of concern for large-scale water resources planning and water supply
> studies, especially in the Western states where evaporation rates can
> exceed rainfall rates. During typical storm periods, with intensities
> of 0.5 in./hr, evaporation is on the order of 0.01 in./hr and is
> normally neglected for flood flow studies and urban drainage design
> applications.
>
> Measurement of evaporation is usually from a standard class A pan
> (Fig. 1--29), which is filled to 8 in. and then observed on a daily
> basis. Adjust- ments are made for rainfall input using a rainfall gage
> nearby. Methods to compute and measure evaporation and
> evapotranspiration are covered in detail in Section 2.6. Evaporation
> and ET are very difficult to measure accu- rately for large
> watersheds.
>
> **Infiltration**, or movement of water from the surface into the soil
> zone, can be measured with a ring infiltrometer, which is a ring about
> 2 ft in diam- eter driven into the soil. Water is placed in the ring,
> and the rate of infiltra- tion, *f*, is measured by the drop in water
> level over time. Carefully controlled experiments require the use of
> tensiometers to measure capillary suction with depth, electrical
> resistance to record moisture content, and wells to record the
> response at the water table below. Infiltration is one of the most
> difficult hydrologic parameters to measure because of the extreme
> variations in soil and water conditions, which can greatly affect the
> measured rate. In actual watersheds, infiltration is often determined
> by the difference between gross rainfall and direct runoff measured
> from a hydrograph. Both simple and advanced infiltration methods are
> presented in Sections 2.7 and 2.8.

> **Streamflow Measurement**
>
> Streamflow is generally measured by observing stage, or elevation
> above a specified elevation datum (i.e., mean sea level), in a channel
> and then relat- ing stage to discharge via a rating curve. A staff
> gage is a fixed scale set so that a portion is immersed in water and
> can be read manually during storm passage. A wire-weight gage is
> lowered from a bridge structure to the water surface, and readings are
> taken as a function of time through a storm event. A crest stage gage
> uses a small amount of cork inside an enclosed staff gage. The cork
> floats as the water rises and adheres to the scale recording at the
> highest water level.
>
> Most automatic recording gages, such as those used by the USGS for
> routine streamflow monitoring, use a float-type device to measure
> stage or a gas bubbler to measure pressure (Fig. 1--30a). The bubble
> gage senses water level by maintaining a continuous stream of gas in a
> small pipe under the water. Another approach is to use a pressure
> transducer near the bottom of a stream that senses the pressure or
> height of water that sits above the monitor. In some urban basins,
> hydrologic data are often transmitted over telephone lines or through
> telemetry directly into computers. Acoustic Doppler flow meters (ADFM)
> have recently emerged as a new method to accurately measure flow rate
> by measuring the actual velocity profile in a pipe or open channel.

> 0.2*D* and 0.8*D* (down from the surface), where *D* is stream depth,
> and average the two values (see Fig. 1--30b).
>
> The total discharge is found by dividing the channel into several
> sections, as shown in Figure 1--30b. The average velocity of each
> section is multiplied by its associated area (width times depth of
> section), and these are summed across the channel to yield total
> discharge *Q* corre- sponding to a particular stage *z*, obtaining one
> point on the graph in Fig- ure 1--31. Other points are obtained by
> measuring velocity at different stages in the stream. Rating curves
> can change through time, as water- sheds change in terms of land use
> and channel type, and should be rechecked periodically.
>
> It will be shown in Chapter 4 that actual rating curves can be looped
> because of storage and hydraulic effects in the channel, and the
> single- valued rating curve is at best an approximation to the actual
> relationship (see Fig. 4--14). A more detailed discussion of
> streamflow prediction and measurement is contained in Chapter 4.

> is equipped with telemetry for radio signals back to a base station or

> **CONCEPT CHECK**

1.  What is the hydrologic cycle? What are the pathways that
    precipitation falling onto the land surface of the earth is
    dispersed to the hydrologic cycle?

2.  Who is responsible for the first recorded rainfall measurements?
    Describe the technique used to obtain these measurements.

3.  Explain the difference between humidity and relative humidity.

4.  Explain how air masses are classified. Where are these types of air
    masses located?

5.  List seven major factors that determine a watershed's response to a
    given rainfall.

> **PROBLEMS**

6.  A lake with a surface area of 750 acres was monitored over a period
    of time. During a one-month period, the inflow was 35 cfs, the
    outflow was 28 cfs, and a 1.5-in. seepage loss was measured. During
    the same month, the total precipita- tion was 4.8 in. Evaporation
    loss was estimated as 6.0 in. Estimate the storage change for this
    lake during the month.

7.  Clear Lake has a surface area of 610,000 m^2^ (61.0 ha). For a given
    month, the lake has an inflow of 1.5 m^3^/s and an outflow of 1.25
    m^3^/s. A + 1.0-m storage change or increase in lake level was
    recorded. If a precipitation gage recorded a total of 20 cm for this
    month, determine the evaporation loss (in cm) for the lake. Assume
    that seepage loss is negligible.

8.  In a given month, a watershed with an area of 1500 m^2^ received 100
    cm of precipitation. During the same month, the loss due to
    evaporation was 15 cm. Ignore losses due to transpiration and
    infiltration due to ground water. What would be the average rate of
    flow measured in a gage at the outlet of the wa- tershed in
    *m*^3^\>day?

9.  In a given year, a watershed with an area of 2000 km^2^ received 120
    cm of precipitation. The average rate of flow measured in a gage at
    the outlet of the watershed was 30 m^3^/sec. Estimate the water
    losses due to the combined effects of evaporation, transpiration,
    and infiltration due to ground water. How much runoff reached the
    river for the year (in cm)?

10. Using the data from problem 1.9, what is the runoff coefficient?

11. Plot Equation (1--4) as a graph (*e~s~* vs. *T*) for a range of
    temperatures from

> \- 305C to 405C and a range of pressures from 0 to 70 mb. The area
> below the curve represents the unsaturated air condition. Using this
> graph, answer the following:

a.  Select two saturated and two unsaturated samples of air from the
    > dataset of pressure and temperature given below:

> Pressure (mb): {10, 20, 30}
>
> Temperature (5C): {10, 20, 30}

b.  Let A and B be two air samples, where A: (*T* = 30°C, *P* = 20 mb)
    > and B: (*T* = 30°C, *P* = 40 mb). For each sample, determine the
    > following:

    i.  Saturation vapor pressure

    ii. Dew point

    iii. Relative humidity

c.  Suppose both samples A and B were cooled to 20°C. What would be
    > their relative humidity? What would be their dew point
    > temperature?

12. The gas constant *R* has the value 2.87 × 10^6^ cm^2^/s^2^ °K for
    dry air, when pres- sure is in mb. Using the ideal gas law (*P* =
    r*RT*), find the density of dry air at 255C with a pressure of 1150
    mb. Find the density of moist air at the same pressure and
    temperature if the relative humidity is 65%.

13. At a weather station, the air pressure was measured to be 95.1 kPa,
    the air temperature was 225C, and the dew point temperature was
    185C. Calculate the corresponding vapor pressure, relative humidity,
    specific humidity, and air density. First compute *e* and *e~s~*.

14. What are the three main mechanisms for generation of vertical air
    motion?

15. Describe the naming system for describing basic clouds.

16. Below are three different atmospheric systems. The dashed line
    represents the dry adiabatic lapse rate where as the solid line
    represents the dry ambient lapse rate. Label whether the atmosphere
    is stable, unstable, or neutral:

21. Table P1--21 lists rainfall data recorded at a USGS gage for the
    storm of Sep- tember 1, 1999. The basin area is 2050 acres. Using
    these data, develop a rain- fall hyetograph (in./hr vs. *t*) in
    15-min intervals and determine the time period with the highest
    intensity rainfall.

23. What is the runoff coefficient for the September 1, 1999, storm,
    > where Coeff.

> = *R*\>*P*?

24. The following questions refer to Figure 1--15, the IDF curve for
    > Houston, Texas.

    a.  What is the return period of a storm that recorded 3.1 in./hr
        > for 2 hr in Houston?

    b.  What amount of rain (in.) would have to fall in a 6-hr period to
        > be consid- ered a 100-yr storm in Houston?

    c.  What is the return period of a storm that lasts 1 hr and records
        > 3.5 in. of rainfall?

    d.  Develop and plot a 6-hr, 100-yr storm design rainfall using 1-hr
        > time steps (see Fig. 1--8). Assume the maximum hourly value
        > occurs between hours 3 and 4.

        i.  Find the rainfall intensity for a 1-hr duration and plot the
            > rainfall intensity in in./hr between the hours of 3 and 4
            > on a bar graph.

        ii. Then, find the rainfall intensity for a 2-hr duration;
            > multiply the in- tensity by the duration of rain to get
            > the volume. Plot the difference between the 2-hr duration
            > volume and the 1-hr duration volume for hour 2 to 3 on a
            > bar graph.

        iii. Continue in the same way for the 3-hr duration, plotting
             > the new intensity to the right of the maximum (hour
             > between 4--5). (Find the 3-hr volume and subtract the
             > 2-hr volume.)

        iv. Then, find the rainfall intensity for a 6-hr duration and
            > the respective volume. Plot the remaining volume (6-hr
            > minus 3-hr) over the 3 hr, assuming equal distribution
            > between them, with two bars to the left and one to the
            > right of the maximum (time intervals 0--1, 1--2, and
            > 5--6).

25. Given the stream section shown in Figure P1--25 and the following
    measure- ments, calculate the total discharge throughout the section
    (Table P1--25).

26. Assume that stations B through L in Problem 1--25 have all become
    0.2 ft deeper. In addition, a tributary has joined the stream and
    added approximately 600 cfs to the flow in the channel. Calculate
    the new discharge amounts for each station by altering the depths
    and adding the tributary's contribution across the channel in
    proportion to the modified discharge distribution. As- sume velocity
    distribution remains unchanged.

27. The incremental rainfall data in the table were recorded at a
    > rainfall gage on a small urban parking lot of 1 acre. Be careful
    > to use a 0.5-hr time step and record intensity in cm/hr.

    a.  Plot the rainfall hyetograph.

    b.  Determine the total storm rainfall depth (inches).

    c.  If 100% of the rainfall occurs as runoff and the time base of a
        > triangular hydrograph (flow rate vs. time) is 3 hr, find the
        > peak flow of the hydro- graph in cfs. Be careful with units.

> *Hint:* First find the volume of rainfall, then equate it to the area
> under the hydrograph.

**2.1**

> **WATERSHED CONCEPTS**
>
> **88**
>
> The **watershed** is the basic unit used in most hydrologic
> calculations relating to the water balance or computation of
> rainfall--runoff and other losses. The **watershed boundary** defines
> a contiguous area, such that the net rainfall or runoff over that area
> will contribute water to the outlet (Fig. 1--19(b)). Rain that falls
> outside the watershed boundary will generate runoff to some other
> outlet. A watershed boundary can be drawn from a topographic map by
> defining the ridgeline to the outlet, and runoff will generally travel
> from higher to lower elevation in a direction perpendicular to the
> elevation con- tours (see Fig. 1--19(b)).
>
> Hydrologists are most often concerned with the amount of surface
> runoff generated within a watershed that becomes streamflow for a
> given input rainfall pattern. The main watershed characteristics that
> affect hydro- logic response include the size, shape, slope, soil
> type, and storage within a watershed area. These issues are described
> in some detail in this chapter and form the basis for more detailed
> analyses in later chapters. The **hydrograph**, as presented earlier,
> is a plot of flow rate vs. time for a given location within a stream
> and represents the main hydrologic response function. Several
>
> example watersheds were depicted in Figure 1--19(a), and a typical
> water- shed with subareas depicted is shown in Figure 1--22.
>
> Watersheds are often characterized by one main channel and by tribu-
> taries that drain into a main channel at one or more confluence
> points. The subarea of a tributary can be delineated by starting at
> the confluence and drawing a boundary along the subarea ridgeline.
> Larger watersheds can have many subareas that contribute runoff to a
> single outlet. An important water- shed parameter is drainage area
> *A*, since it reflects the volume of water that can be generated from
> rainfall. Watershed length measures are depicted for subarea E in
> Figure 1--22. Channel length *L* is usually measured along the main
> channel from the outlet to the basin divide. Length to centroid *L~c~*
> is measured along the main channel to a point nearest the centroid
> (center of mass) of the watershed. These two length parameters help
> determine water- shed shape and are used extensively in unit
> hydrograph calculations dis- cussed later (Section 2.3).
>
> Another important physiographic parameter is **channel slope *S ***or
> **watershed slope *S*~0~**, which reflects the rate of change of
> elevation with dis- tance along the main channel or within an overland
> flow area. Both slope measures are used in performing unit hydrograph,
> flood routing, and time- of-travel calculations. Slope estimates are
> used in several of the unit hydro- graph methods described later in
> this chapter. Field surveys or topographic maps, either paper or
> electronic, can be used to measure elevation changes so that watershed
> or channel slopes can be determined.
>
> **Soil types** in a watershed are critical, as they determine
> infiltration rates that can occur for the area. Soil properties can
> vary significantly across a watershed area, and the USDA Natural
> Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is responsible for developing
> soils maps to provide information on soil type, soil texture, and
> hydrologic soil groups. The three main soil classes are characterized
> by particle diameter *d* in mm, for sand, silt, and clay. Typical
> values are listed in Table 8--2 in Chapter 8. Soil texture is
> important in determining water-holding capacity and infiltration
> capacity of a soil layer. Thus, sands generally infiltrate water at a
> greater rate than do silts or clays. Of course, there can be mixtures
> of sizes, which can complicate the overall soil structure. The NRCS
> classified thousands of soils on the basis of runoff potential and
> grouped them into four hydrologic soil groups, A, B, C, and D. Type A
> infiltrates at the highest rate, D at the lowest. The relationship of
> soil type to infiltration capacity is presented in detail in Sec-
> tions 2.8 and 2.9.
>
> **Land use and land cover**, in the form of parking lots and urban
> develop- ment, can have profound effects on watershed response. In
> fact, many of the methods described later were developed to address
> urban development impacts in a watershed. For example, the **Rational
> Method** \[see Eq. (1--13)\] uses a coefficient *C* to reflect the
> runoff potential of a watershed. The value of *C* for commercial
> (0.75) is greater than residential (0.3), which is greater than
> forested (0.15), indicating that more intense development generates
>
> greater rates of runoff for the same rainfall (see Sections 6.4 and
> 9.3). Urban development is also characterized by the percent
> imperviousness, or paved area, which can range from 50% to 90% for
> commercial compared to 20% to 40% for residential areas (see Table
> 2--1). Several of the unit hydrograph methods (Section 2.3) contain
> parameters that relate to urban land use effects.

> **UNIT HYDROGRAPH**

**THEORY**

> Sherman (1932) originally advanced the theory of the unit hydrograph
> (UH), defined as "basin outflow resulting from 1.0 inch (1.0 mm) of
> direct runoff generated uniformly over the drainage area at a uniform
> rainfall rate during a specified period of rainfall duration." An
> important point here is that UH is composed of 1.0 inch of direct
> runoff, which is equivalent to 1.0 inch of net rainfall for a given
> duration, *D*, and therefore all losses to infiltration must be
> subtracted before computations. Several assumptions inherent in the
> unit hydrograph approach tend to limit its application for any given
> watershed (Johnstone and Cross, 1949):

1.  Rainfall excesses of equal duration are assumed to produce
    > hydrographs with equivalent time bases regardless of the intensity
    > of the rain.

2.  Direct runoff ordinates for a storm of given duration are assumed
    > directly proportional to rainfall excess volumes. Thus, twice the
    > rain- fall produces a doubling of hydrograph ordinates.

3.  The time distribution of direct runoff is assumed independent of
    > antecedent precipitation.

4.  Rainfall distribution is assumed to be the same for all storms of
    > equal duration, both spatially and temporally.

> The classic statement of unit hydrograph theory can be summarized
> briefly: The hydrologic system is linear and time invariant (Dooge,
> 1973). The linear assumption implies that complex storm hydrographs
> can be pro- duced by adding up individual unit hydrographs, adjusted
> for rainfall vol- umes and added and lagged in time. For example, a
> 2-inch rainfall in X hours will produce double the response of 1 inch
> falling in X hours over a given watershed. While the assumptions of
> linearity and time invariance are not strictly correct for every
> watershed, we adopt them as long as they are useful. Nonlinear
> examples exist in open-channel flow, laboratory runoff models, and
> actual watersheds.

> aspects of the hydrograph can be charac- terized by the following

1.  **Duration** of rainfall excess (*D*): the time from start to finish
    > of rain- fall excess.

2.  **Lag time** (*t~p~*): the time from the center of mass of rainfall
    > excess to the peak of the hydrograph.

3.  **Time of rise** (*T~R~*): the time from the start of rainfall
    > excess to the peak of the hydrograph.

4.  **Time of concentration** (*t~c~*): the time for a wave (of water)
    > to propa- gate from the most distant point in the watershed to the
    > outlet. One estimate is the time from the end of net rainfall to
    > the inflection point of the hydrograph.

5.  **Time base** (*T~b~*): the total duration of the DRO hydrograph.

> If rainfall--runoff data exist, it is useful to develop unit
> hydrographs from measured rainfall events and streamflow from gages in
> a defined water- shed. The following general rules should be observed
> in developing unit hydrographs from gauged watersheds:

1.  Storms should be selected with a simple structure with relatively
    > uniform spatial and temporal distributions.

2.  Watershed sizes should generally fall between 1.0 and 100 mi^2^ in
    > modern watershed analysis.

3.  Direct runoff should range from 0.5 to 2.0 in.

4.  Duration of rainfall excess *D* should be approximately 25% to 30%
    > of lag time *t~p~*.

5.  A number of storms of similar duration should be analyzed to obtain
    > an average unit hydrograph for that duration.

6.  Step 5 should be repeated for several rainfalls of different
    > duration.

> The following are the essential steps for developing a unit hydrograph
> from a single storm hydrograph (see Fig. 2--1 and Example 2--1):

1.  Analyze the hydrograph and separate base flow.

2.  Measure the total volume of DRO under the hydrograph and con- vert
    > this to inches (mm) over the watershed.

3.  Convert total rainfall to rainfall excess through infiltration
    > methods, such that rainfall excess = DRO, and evaluate duration
    > *D* of the rainfall excess that produced the DRO hydrograph.

4.  Divide the ordinates of the DRO hydrograph (Fig. 2--1(b)) by the
    > volume in inches (mm) and plot these results as the unit

> Because of assumptions of linearity inherent in the UH development,

> long-duration storm, assumptions of linearity may be violated. Also,
> if storage effects in the water- shed are important, assumptions may
> be violated. For large watersheds (above 100--500 mi^2^), it is
> usually advisable to divide the watershed into a number of subareas so
> that individual UHs can be developed for each. Typ- ically, UH should
> not exceed areas of 5 to 10 sq mi.
>
> Amount of runoff and areal distribution of runoff can cause variations
> in the shape of the hydrograph. For large basins, it is usually best
> to develop UHs for subareas and then add and lag, or convolute, them
> together to gen- erate an overall hydrograph. Peaks of UHs derived
> from very small events are often lower than those derived from larger
> storms because of differences in interflow and channel flow times.
> Assumptions of linearity can usually be verified by comparing
> hydrographs from storms of various magnitudes. If nonlinearity does
> exist, then derived UHs should be used only for generating events of
> similar magnitude, and caution should be exercised in using unit
> hydrographs to extrapolate to extreme events. Despite these
> limitations, when unit hydrographs have been used in conjunction with
> modern flood routing methods, resulting flood prediction for small and
> large basins is quite accurate. Detailed applications of the unit
> hydrograph are presented later in this chapter and in Chapters 5 and
> 9.
>
> **S-Curve Method**
>
> A UH for a particular watershed is defined for a specific duration *D*
> of rainfall excess (RF~net~). The linear property of the UH can be
> used to gen- erate a UH of larger or smaller duration. For example,
> given a 1-hr UH for a particular watershed, a UH resulting from a 2-hr
> unit storm can be developed by adding two 1-hr UHs, the second one
> lagged by 1 hr, adding together the ordinates, and dividing the result
> by 2. In this way, the 1 in. of rainfall in 1 hr has been distributed
> uniformly over 2 hr in deriving the 2-hr UH (Fig. 2--2). This lagging
> procedure is restricted to integer multi- ples of the original
> duration. In the same way, the 3-hr UH results from adding and lagging
> three together and dividing the ordinates by 3 (see Example 2--3).
>
> The **S-curve method** allows construction of a UH of any duration.
> Assume that a UH of duration *D* is known and that we wish to generate
> a UH for the same watershed with duration *D*\'. The first step is to
> generate the S-curve hydrograph by adding a series of UHs of duration
> *D,* each lagged by time period *D*. This corresponds to the runoff
> hydrograph result- ing from a continuous rainfall excess intensity of
> 1 *D* in./hr, where *D* is measured in hours. Note that an equilibrium
> hydrograph (S-curve) results

>
> By shifting the S-curve in time by *D*\' hr and subtracting ordinates
> between the two S-curves, the resulting hydrograph (Fig. 2--3, curve
> b) must be due to rainfall of 1 *D* in./hr that occurs for *D*\' hr.
> Thus, to con- vert curve b to a UH, we must multiply all the
> hydrograph ordinates by *D D*\' resulting in the UH of duration *D*\'.
> A homework problem explores these calculations in detail. The
> procedure is ideally suited for an Excel spread sheet.
>
> **Unit Hydrograph Convolution**
>
> The real importance of the UH approach is demonstrated in the develop-
> ment of storm hydrographs due to an actual rainfall event over a
> watershed. UH ordinates *U~j~* are multiplied by rainfall excess
> *P~n~* and added and lagged in a sequence to produce a resulting storm
> hydrograph, which ideally can be done using available Excel
> spreadsheets. Hydrograph convolution, the procedure of deriving a
> storm hydrograph from a multiperiod rainfall excess, is illustrated in
> Example 2--2. For actual watersheds, these calcula- tions are almost
> always done in a hydrologic model such as HEC-HMS (see Chapter 5).
>
> Each unit hydrograph is added at the time corresponding to the rain-
> fall spike that produced a response. Base flow can be added to produce
> a
>
> realistic storm hydrograph if base flow values are available for the
> water- shed under study. Care should be taken in this calculation to
> ensure that the time increments of rainfall excess correspond exactly
> to the duration of the UH. For example, 1-hr time increments should be
> used with the 1-hr UH. The governing equation for the storm hydrograph
> in discrete form is called the **convolution equation**:

> *Q~n~* = a *P~i~U~n~*~-*i*+1~, (2--1)

> *P*~1~*U~j~*,
>
> where *Q~n~* is the storm hydrograph ordinate, *P~i~* is rainfall
> excess, and *U~j~* (*j* = *n* - *i* + 1) is the unit hydrograph
> ordinate. Periods of no rainfall can also be included, as shown in
> Example 2--2.

> **STORM HYDROGRAPH FROM THE UNIT HYDROGRAPH**

>
> The first line of development was based on the rational method modi-
> fied to include the travel time to the outlet for a particular
> watershed. Clark (1945) assumed that watershed response would be given
> by routing the time-- area relationship through an element of linear
> storage (see Eq. 2--23), which tends to attenuate and time-lag the
> hydrograph. The Clark unit hydrograph is contained in HEC-HMS and is
> presented in detail later in this section and in Table 5--10. The
> second approach to UH development assumed mathe- matical
> representations for the shape of the UH. A useful approach was
> advanced by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS, 1964, 1986), based on
> mea- surements from thousands of small watershed areas, which
> represented a dimensionless UH of discharge vs. time by a gamma
> function (discussed later). Since volume is fixed, only one parameter
> is required to determine the entire UH, either the *t~p~* or the peak
> flow rate, *Q~p~*.
>
> In the late 1950s, both approaches began to converge after the impor-
> tant contributions of O'Kelly (1955) and Nash (1958, 1959). O'Kelly's
> work was based on replacing the time--area curve by a UH in the shape
> of an isosceles triangle. Empirical expressions were necessary to
> transform the methods of Clark (1945) into usable UH techniques for
> actual basins. John- stone and Cross (1949) proposed one of the first
> relationships for *t~c~*, the time of concentration in hours, defined
> earlier in the chapter.
>
> *t~c~* = 5.0(*L*\> 1*S*)^0.5^, (2--6)

> and for **storage delay time**, *K*, in hours,

> *K* = 1.5 + 90(*A*\>*LR*), (2--7)
>
> where *L* is the length of the main stream in mi, *A* is the area in
> mi^2^, *S* is the slope in ft/mi, and *R* is an overland slope factor.
>
> Hydrologists have realized that a number of parameters are important
> in determining the shape and timing of the UH for a watershed. The lag
> or time to peak *t~p~* and the time of concentration *t~c~* are often
> used (Fig. 2--1(a)). The time of rise *T~R~* measured from time zero
> to the hydrograph peak is sometimes used. The time base *T~b~* of the
> hydrograph is included to define the duration of direct runoff. These
> timing parameters must be statistically or theoretically related to
> watershed characteristics in developing a syn- thetic UH.
>
> The discharge parameter most often used is the peak discharge *Q~p~*.
> A **routing parameter** *K* is sometimes included when the hydrograph
> has been routed through a linear reservoir with storage delay time
> *K*. This tends to delay and attenuate the input hydrograph. Watershed
> parameters of most concern include area *A*, main channel length *L*,
> length to watershed centroid *L~c~*, and slope of main channel *S*
> (see Section 2.1 and Fig. 1--22).
>
> **Assumptions and Modifying Factors**
>
> Most synthetic UH methods assume that the UH of a basin represents the
> integrated effect of size, slope, shape, and storage characteristics.
> As long as these factors are constant between two basins and do not
> vary with time, the unit response will be identical for the two
> basins. For two basins of the same size, if the slope of one is
> greater or if the basin shape of one is more con- centrated (if the
> length/width ratio is lower), the shape of the hydrograph will shift,
> as shown by the shift from *a* to *b* in Figure 2--5. Storage
> character- istics of the basin relate to slope, soil type, topography,
> channel resistance, and shape. If upstream reservoir storage is
> combined with downstream chan- nelization, the UH may shift to curve
> *b* due to a more rapid rise time from concrete channels and less
> infiltration loss from urban development. Finally, if an elongated
> basin were fully developed, one might expect a shift to curve *c*,
> where time of rise is much shorter and peak flow is much greater than
> in the original UH, *a*. Such a case is shown in Figure 2--6 for a
> fully developed watershed, Brays Bayou in Houston, Texas. Original
> synthetic hydrograph methods generally do not consider urbanization
> effects, but more modern empirical formulas usually account for urban
> channels, percent impervious (paved) area, or percent storm-sewered
> area.

> Time (hr)
>
> Most of the methods for synthetic UHs relate lag time *t~p~* or time
> of rise *T~R~* of the hydrograph to measures of the length of the main
> channel and shape of the basin. Some methods also relate timing to the
> inverse of the slope of the main channel or land. Thus, the longer the
> basin and the smaller the slope, the greater the time of rise of the
> hydrograph, as expected. Fig- ure 1--19(a) (Chapter 1) shows the
> general effect of watershed shape and land use (i.e., elongated vs.
> concentrated) on UH response.
>
> A second relation is usually presented between peak flow *Q~p~* and
> area of basin, and between *Q~p~* and the inverse of the *t~p~* or
> *T~R~* of the hydrograph, thus indicating that larger areas produce
> higher *Q~p~*. From continuity, the higher the peak flow, the smaller
> *t~p~* must be to keep the volume of the unit
>
> hydrograph constant with 1.0 in. of direct runoff. This is easily seen
> by refer- ring to Figure 2--5, where curves *a*, *b*, and *c* are all
> unit hydrographs. The following sections describe a few of the more

> Once the three quantities *t~p~*, *Q~p~*, and *T~b~* are known, the UH

> **Clark UH Method**
>
> The Clark (1945) UH is based on the use of a watershed and is modeled
> as a linear channel in series with a linear reservoir to account for
> translation and attenuation, respectively. This conceptual model
> defines the outflow from the linear channel as inflow (*I~i~*) to the
> linear reservoir, and the outflow
>
> (*O~i~*) from the linear reservoir as the instantaneous unit
> hydrograph (IUH). The linear channel uses an area--time relationship
> (i.e., isochrones of travel time to the outlet of watershed), and it
> is used to estimate the time distribu- tion of runoff from the basin.
> Time of concentration is represented by the time of runoff from the
> most remote part of the basin to the outlet. The linear reservoir
> signifies the combining effects of storage and resistance from the
> basin. Hoggan (1997) described the Clark method in details using the
> concept of the instantaneous unit hydrograph. Derivation starts with
> the relationship between the reservoir outflow and the storage is
> expressed as
>
> *S~i~* = *RO~i~*, (2--23)
>
> where
>
> *S~i~* = storage at end of period *i*, *O~i~* = outflow during period
> *i*, *R* = storage coefficient.

>
> Two major parameters of the Clark unit hydrograph are the time of con-
> centration *T~c~* and the storage coefficient *R*, which is the slope
> of the storage-- outflow curve for the linear reservoir. *T~c~* and
> *R* values can usually be obtained
>
> from observed hydrographs for gaged basins: *T~c~* is estimated as the
> time from the end of a burst rainfall excess to the inflection point
> on the receding limb; *R* is estimated by dividing the direct-runoff
> discharge at the inflection point by the slope of the curve at that
> point. The inflection point means where inflow to the linear reservoir
> is zero. At the inflection point, the continuity equation can be

> *R* = -(*Oi* - *Oi* - 1)\>Δ*t*. (2--29)
>
> Equation (2--29) theoretically produces the value of *R* as the ratio
> between the average discharge at the inflection point and the negative
> slope of the hydrograph at this point (which is negative).
>
> For ungaged basins, *T~c~* is usually determined from an analysis of
> travel time in the basin or from regression relationships that have
> been developed for the region. Even though the storage coefficient
> (*R*) cannot be obtained from measurable watershed characteristics
> directly, many regression equa- tions have been developed from some
> regions. Because *T~c~* and *R* are inter- dependent, the combining
> variables, *T~c~* + *R* and *R* (*T~c~* + *R*) are always used in unit
> hydrograph computations. Thus, the Clark method is now called the TC
> and R method, and is routinely used in HEC-HMS models, as shown in
> Table 5--10.
>
> Once a UH of given duration based on known storms or synthetic methods
> has been developed for a particular basin under a given set of physio-
> graphic conditions, it can then be utilized for a number of hydrologic
> cal- culations (Fig. 2--9). Such hydrographs can be developed for
> almost any area where UH methods have been developed or by applying
> general methods such as SCS's or Snyder's. In particular, for a single
> basin area, the UH can be used with a given storm event to determine
> the storm hydrograph through the add-and-lag procedure. For complex
> watersheds of several subbasins:

1.  Design storm hydrographs for selected recurrence-interval storms
    (10-yr, 25-yr, 100-yr) can be developed through convolution (adding
    and lagging) procedures for a given watershed area (Fig. 2--9(a)).

2.  Effects of land use changes, channel modifications, storage
    additions, and other variables can be tested to determine changes in
    the UH (Fig. 2--9).

3.  Storm hydrographs for each subbasin can be simulated by adding,
    > lagging, and routing the flows produced by unit hydrographs
    > through channel reaches (Chapter 4). Effects of various rainfall
    > pat- terns and land use distributions can be tested on overall
    > hydrologic response of the large watershed (Fig. 2--9(b)), as
    > demonstrated in Example 2--7.

4.  Storage routing methods (Chapter 4) can be used to translate inflow
    > UHs through a reservoir or detention basin of particular size to
    > attenuate peak flow or lag time to the peak of the hydrograph.
    > This is used for analysis of flood control options.

> **HYDROGRAPH CONVOLUTION**
>
> Given UH~1~ and UH~2~ for two subareas of a watershed that meet at
> conflu- ence point *A*; use the 10-yr 6-hr design rainfall for Houston
> (Fig. 1--15) to find the resulting storm hydrograph at the point of
> confluence. Use hydrograph convolution (add and lag). Assume
> infiltration losses are
>
> 0.15 in. for the first hour and 0.1 in./hr thereafter. Estimate the
> area of subarea 1. Figure E2--7 shows the watershed.

> IUH was shown to be equivalent to the output from a cascade of linear

> A useful mathematical extension of UHs of finite duration can be

> the quantity (unit depth) remains constant. The runoff produced by
> this "instan- taneous rainfall" is called the **instantaneous unit
> hydrograph**. The IUH is a response function for a particular
> watershed to a unit impulse of rainfall excess. By summing up the
> outputs due to all instantaneous inputs through time, one arrives at
> *Q*(*t*), the output hydrograph.
>
> The IUH is assumed to be a unique function for a watershed, indepen-
> dent of time or antecedent conditions. The output function *Q*(*t*),
> or total storm discharge, is produced by summing the outputs due to

> The real usefulness of the IUH as a mathematical concept can be seen

**HYDROLOGIC**

> **LOSS--- EVAPORATION**

**AND ET**

> **Introduction to Evaporation**
>
> Evaporation is the process by which water in its liquid or solid state
> is trans- formed into water vapor, which as a gas mixes with the
> atmosphere. Evapo- transpiration (*ET*) is considered separately as
> the combined loss of water vapor from the surface of plants
> (transpiration) and the evaporation of mois- ture from soil. Knowledge
> of evaporation processes is important in predict- ing water losses to
> evaporation from a lake or reservoir. On average, approximately 70% of
> the mean annual rainfall in the United States is returned to the
> atmosphere as evaporation or transpiration. However, vari- ations in
> evaporation across the continent can be very large due to effects of
> solar input, location of mountains, and proximity to oceans. On an
> annual basis, evaporation rates can exceed mean annual rainfall,
> especially in arid regions of the southwest. For example, arid areas
> in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and southern California can
> exceed 70 in. per year, com- pared to about 30 to 40 in. per year for
> much of the rest of the country.
>
> For the case of evaporation from a lake surface, water loss is a
> function of solar radiation, temperature of the water and air,
> difference in vapor pres- sure between water and the overlying air,
> and wind speed across the lake. As evaporation proceeds in a
> closed-container system at a constant tem- perature, pressure in the
> air space increases because of an increase in partial pressure of
> water vapor. Evaporation continues until vapor pressure of the
> overlying air equals the surface vapor pressure; at this point, the
> air space is said to be saturated at that temperature, and further
> evaporation ceases. This state of equilibrium would not be reached if
> the container were open to the atmosphere, in which case all water
> would eventually evaporate. Ther- mal energy is required to increase
> the free energy of water molecules to allow escape across the
> liquid--gas interface. The amount of heat required to convert water to
> vapor at constant temperature (597 cal/g at 0°C) is called the latent

> **Water Budget Method for Determining Evaporation**
>
> The water budget method for lake evaporation is based on the
> continuity equation. Assuming that change in storage Δ*S*, surface
> inflow *I*, surface out- flow *O*, subsurface seepage to ground water
> flow *GW*, and precipitation *P* can be measured, evaporation *E* can
> be computed as
>
> *E* = - Δ*S* + *I* + *P* - *O* - *GW*. (2--33)
>
> The approach is simple in theory, but evaluating seepage terms can
> make the method quite difficult to implement. The obvious problems
> result from errors in measuring precipitation, inflow, outflow, change
> in storage, and subsurface seepage. Good estimates using the method
> were obtained for Lake Hefner, near Oklahoma City, with 5% to 10%
> error. It should be emphasized that Lake Hefner was selected from more
> than one hundred lakes and reservoirs as one of three or four that
> best met water budget requirements and had minimal seepage losses to
> the subsurface.
>
> **Mass Transfer Method**
>
> Mass transfer techniques are based primarily on the concept of
> turbulent transfer of water vapor from a water surface to the
> atmosphere. Numerous empirical formulas have been derived to express
> evaporation rate as a function of vapor-pressure differences and wind
> speed above a lake or reservoir. Many such equations can be written in
> the form of a diffusive flux of water vapor, whose concept dates back
> to Dalton's original theories (Brutsaert, 1982):
>
> *E* = (*e~s~* - *e~a~*)(*a* + *bu*), (2--34)
>
> where
>
> *e~s~* = saturation vapor pressure at the *T~s~* of the water surface,
>
> *e~a~* = vapor pressure at some fixed level above the water surface,
> the product of relative humidity times saturation vapor pressure at
> *T~a~* of the air,
>
> = wind speed,
>
> *a*, *b* = empirical constants.
>
> An obstacle to comparing different evaporation formulas is the vari-
> ability in measurement heights for *u* and *e~a~*. Reducing all
> formulas to the same measurement level of 2 m (6.5 ft) for wind speed
> and vapor pressure and taking into account the 30% difference between
> reservoir and pan evap- oration, the scatter between the common
> formulas is considerably reduced. The formula with the best database
> is the Lake Hefner formula given by Marciano and Harbeck (1954), which
> also performed well at Lake Mead (Harbeck, 1958). Some formulas use a
> zero value of the constant *a* in Equa- tion (2--34), due probably to
> small local air movements with velocities insuf- ficient to remove
> excess vapor from above a pan surface. Harbeck and Meyers (1970)

> *u*~2~ = wind speed 2 m above the water surface (m/s).
>
> **Energy Budget Method**
>
> The most accurate and complex method for determining evaporation uses

>
> difference between observed levels, adjusted for any precipitation
> measured in a standard rain gage. Alternatively, water is added each

> 0.81 and averages 0.70 for the United States. However, the pan

> **Evapotranspiration**

For a water budget over the whole watershed, one is usually concerned
with the total evaporation from all free-water surfaces, plus
**transpiration**, the loss of vapor through small openings (stomata) in
plant tissue (e.g., leaves). For most plants, transpiration occurs only
during daylight hours during photo- synthesis, which can lead to diurnal
variations in the shallow ground water table in heavily vegetated areas.
The combined evaporation and transpira- tion loss is called
**evapotranspiration (ET)** and is a maximum if the water supply to both
the plant and soil surface is unlimited. The maximum possible loss is
limited by meteorological conditions and is called **potential ET**
(Thornthwaite, 1948); potential ET is approximately equal to the
evapora- tion from a large, free-water surface such as a lake. Thus,
methods discussed in the previous section for evaporation can be used to
predict potential ET. Large surface area and high temperature of leaves
can easily create transpiration rates that equal or even exceed
potential ET. Exceedance is possible in instances of an "oasis" of
well-watered vegetation, such as a crop or golf course, located in a
larger area in which actual ET is less than the potential. Actual
transpiration and, hence, actual ET are usually lim- ited by moisture
supply to the plants. Obviously the effect of limited mois- ture will
depend on plant characteristics such as root depth and the ability of
the soil to transport water to the roots. These effects have led to
various empirical factors that may be applied to potential ET, computed
using one of the evaporation methods discussed previously. For example,
Penman (1950) determined that ET from a vegetated land surface in Great
Britain was 60% to 80% of potential ET computed using his method; Shih
et al. (1983) used a value of 70% for crops in southern Florida. On the
other hand, Priestly and Taylor (1972) multiplied Penman equation
evaporation by 1.26 for well-watered crops to compute ET. Other
empirical formulas

1.  The soil under consideration is homogeneous and stable, implying
    that macropores and preferential migration pathways should not be
    considered.

2.  The supply of ponded water at the surface is not limited (an assump-
    tion subject to modification below).

3.  A distinct and precisely definable wetting front exists, and as
    > water continues to infiltrate, the wetting front advances at the
    > same rate with depth.

4.  The capillary suction just below the wetting front is uniform
    > through- out the profile and constant in time during the
    > infiltration event.

5.  The soil is uniformly saturated above the wetting front, and the
    > vol- umetric water contents remain constant above and below the
    > advanc- ing wetting front.

> At the wetting front, the average capillary suction head c is used to
> represent the characteristic moisture curve. The moisture-content

> The area above the moisture profile is the amount of infiltration up

    Remem- bering that the hydraulic conductivity that transmits water
    downward based on the hydrostatic pressure is accompanied by the
    suction head, c, which pulls water downward into unsaturated soil,
    Equation (2--52) indicates that the infiltration rate is a value
    greater than the saturated hydraulic conductiv- ity as long as there
    is sufficient water at the surface for infiltration, as sketched in
    curves B--C and D of Figure 2--19c. The infiltration rate decreases
    as the cumulative infiltration increases.

> Solution of the Green and Ampt equation requires the estimation of
> three parameters: the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity
> (*K~s~*), the moisture deficit (*M~d~*), and the wetting front suction

> **SNOWFALL AND SNOWMELT**
>
> A small percentage (about 13%) of precipitation over the entire U.S.
> falls as snow, but it can be a dominant source of streamflow,
> especially in mountain- ous areas during spring melt. This is
> certainly true of the western United States, but significant
> percentages of runoff in the northeast and midwest also originate as
> snow. Because the storage and melting of snow play an important role
> in the hydrologic cycle of some areas, hydrologists must be able to
> reliably predict the contribution of snowmelt to overall runoff.
> Because snowmelt begins in the spring and the derived runoff is out of
> phase with periods of greatest water demand, control schemes such as
> storage res- ervoirs have been implemented in many areas for water
> supply. Under cer- tain conditions, snowmelt can also contribute to
> flooding problems, especially in larger river basins with mountainous
> areas. In addition to forecasting flood situations, snowmelt
> predictions are also valuable to power companies that generate
> hydroelectricity and to irrigation districts.
>
> Because of the range of uses for estimating the contribution of snow-
> melt to streamflow and the variation of conditions applicable to each
> case, many methods have been developed for computing snowmelt as it
> affects streamflow. These methods have consistently found that the
> timing and
>
> amount of runoff depend mainly on three factors: the energy of a
> snowpack available for melt, the areal extent of the melting
> snowcover, and the effects of storage on the movement of the meltwater
> (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Snow measurements are obtained using standard and recording rain
> gages, snow stakes, and snow boards, which measure accumulation over a
> period of time. Snow surveys at a number of spaced points along a snow
> course are necessary to account for drifting and blowing snow. The
> Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) uses devices called snow
> pillows, which continuously record and transmit the pressure from snow
> at the bottom of a snowpack. The NRCS has about 500 telemetry sites
> ("SNOTEL" sites) throughout the western United States transmitting
> data from snow pillows.
>
> The distribution of mean annual snowfall in the United States is quite
> variable, and errors may be large in mountainous regions because of
> the lack of measurements in remote areas. There is a gradual increase
> in snowfall with latitude and elevation, and from 400 to 500 in./yr
> (\~1000 cm/yr) can occur in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range of the
> western United States. Large snows
>
> can also occur near the Great Lakes, with average values over 100 in.
> (254 cm).
>
> **Physics of Snowmelt**
>
> The energy exchanged between the snowpack, the atmosphere, and the
> earth's surface is the controlling factor in rates of snowmelt. Other
> geo- graphic, topographic, and surface cover factors are also
> important. Density of snow is a major aspect of predicting runoff and
> is determined by several factors. Snow that is formed under dry, cold
> conditions will be less dense than snow formed under wet and warmer
> conditions. As snow accumulates on the ground over a period of time,
> its density increases with the settling and compaction due to factors
> such as wind. Wind increases the density of snow in two ways: First,
> the turbulence breaks ice crystals into smaller ones, making them
> settle more compactly, and second, drag forces are exerted on the
> surface of snow due to the moving air and particles. Newly fallen snow
> has a density about 10% that of liquid water, but the density can
> increase to 50% with aging. The depth of water that would result if
> all the snow melted is called the **snow water equivalent, SWE**, and
> is given by the equation
>
> SWE = 0.01 *d~s~*r*~s~*, (2--55)
>
> where SWE is in mm, snowdepth *d~s~* is in cm, and r*~s~* is in
> kg/m^3^. The density of snow is often assumed to be 100 kg/m^3^. Hence
> a rule of thumb for new snow is that the depth of water equivalent is
> approximately 1/10 the depth of the snowpack. *Ripe snow* holds all
> the liquid water it can against the action of gravity. If a snowpack
> is ripe, additional rain can not only result in runoff itself but also
> warm the snow due to the release of the latent heat when the rain
> fuses with the pack (Male and Gray, 1981). Hence, any heat added to
> ripe snow will produce runoff. Heat added to a snowpack at a
> temperature below freezing will act to warm it.
>
> Snowmelt and evaporation are both thermodynamic processes and can be
> studied with an energy-balance approach. The energy for snowmelt is
> derived from the following: (1) net solar radiation, (2) net longwave
> radia- tion exchange (from atmosphere and clouds), (3) conduction
> (diffusion) and convection transfer of sensible heat to or from the
> overlying air, (4) conden- sation of water vapor from the overlying
> air, (5) conduction from the under- lying soil, and (6) heat supply by
> incident rainfall. The heat exchange at the snow--air interface
> dominates the snowmelt process, and heat exchange with the soil is
> secondarily important.
>
> For each gram of water melted in a snowpack at 0°C (32°F), 80 cal/g of
> latent heat must be supplied. Thus, if the density of water is 1 g/cm,
> 80 cal will melt 80 cm^3^ (water equivalent) of snow. Hence, 80 ly
> (cal/cm^2^) are required to melt 1 cm depth of snow. Meltwater may
> refreeze with cooling, or it may drain from the snowpack, contributing
> to soil moisture, streamflow, or ground water recharge. Snowmelt
> computations are made difficult by the variations in solar radiation
> received by the surface and variations in the **albedo**, the
> reflection coefficient equal to the ratio of reflected to incident
> shortwave radiation.
>
> Although only 5% to 10% of incoming shortwave radiation is reflected
> by a water surface, up to 83% is reflected by a clean, dry snow
> surface. As the snow ages, its albedo can drop to less than 50%
> because of structural changes, and shortwave radiation penetrates to
> varying depths, depending on snow density. New precipitation affects

> rain reduces it to 0.4 (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Snow radiates essentially as a black body (emissivity = 0.97)
> according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and outgoing longwave radiation
> at 0°C is equivalent to 8.4 cm (3.3 in.) of melt over a one-day
> period. Because of re- radiation from the atmosphere back to the
> earth, longwave radiation loss is equivalent to only about 2 cm (0.8
> in.) of melt per day under clear skies and near-freezing temperatures.
>
> Heat exchange between a snowpack and the atmosphere is affected by
> conduction, convection, condensation, and evaporation (Anderson, 1976;
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1956). However, very little evaporation
> from snow occurs. Direct transformation of snow (ice) to vapor, known
> as *sublimation,* is an important part of the water balance in the
> Arctic. Wind velocity and air temperature are primary factors
> affecting the density of new snow. The rate of transfer of sensible
> heat (convection) is proportional to the temperature difference
> between the air *T~a~* and the snow *T~s~* and to the wind velocity
> *v.* Condensation melt is proportional to the vapor-pressure
> difference between the snow surface and the atmosphere and to the wind
> velocity. The transfer of heat from the underlying soil to the
> snowpack is small on a daily basis but may accumulate to several
> centimeters of melt during an entire season. This may be enough to
> keep the soil saturated and to produce a rapid response of runoff when
> melting occurs. Raindrop temperature is reduced as it enters a
> snowpack, and an equivalent amount of heat is imparted to the snow
> based on the surface wet-bulb temperature. For example, the heat
> available in 10 mm of rain at 10°C will melt about 1.2 mm of water
> from the snowpack.
>
> In many basins of very high relief, the lower limit of snowcover (the
> snow line) is dynamic and moves up and down the slope. As melting pro-
> ceeds, snowcover recedes more rapidly on southerly and barren slopes,
> with the rate of snowmelt decreasing with elevation. Given the
> temperature at an index station, an area--elevation curve for the
> basin, and the average snow- line elevation, one can compute the area
> subject to melting based on the rate of change of temperature with
> elevation, typically about 1°C per 100 m (5°F per 1000 ft) increase in
> elevation.
>
> **The Snowpack Energy Budget**
>
> The snowpack energy budget is written in terms of the energy flux to
> and from the snowpack, with units of energy per unit area per unit
> time. The most convenient units for *Q* are cal/cm^2^-day (ly/day). In
> terms of the energy budget components mentioned earlier,

Δ*H*\>Δ*t* = *Q~N~* + *Q~g~* + *Q~c~* + *Q~e~* + *Q~p~*, (2--56)

> where
>
> Δ*H* = change in heat storage in snowpack,
>
> *Q~N~* = net (incoming minus reflected minus outgoing) shortwave and
> longwave radiation,
>
> *Q~g~* = conduction of heat to snowpack from underlying ground,
>
> *Q~c~* = convective transport of sensible heat from air to snowpack
> (negative if from snowpack to air),
>
> *Q~e~* = release of latent heat of vaporization by condensation of
> water vapor onto snowpack,
>
> *Q~p~* = advection of heat to snowpack by rain.
>
> If the change in storage is positive, it will act either to warm the
> snow, or to ripen the snow, or to produce melt. These are the three
> phases of snow melt, though they do not always occur in clear, steady
> sequence (Dingman, 2002). Detailed computation of net shortwave and
> longwave radiation is discussed in detail in Gray and Prowse, (1993).
> Convective heat transport and con- densation melt are both diffusive
> processes; the heat flux is proportional to the gradient of
> temperature for the former and to the gradient of vapor pressure for
> the latter. Diffusivities or transfer coefficients are functions of
> wind velocity and surface roughness. Heat transfer to or from the
> ground *Q~g~* is usually neglected unless the snowpack and ground
> surface tempera- tures are both known. Heat advected by rain into the
> snowpack is simply proportional to the difference between the rain
> temperature (usually as- sumed equal to the wet-bulb temperature) and
> the temperature of the snow.
>
> Using a given time duration and the sum of energy budget components in
> ly/day (*Q*~1~ + *Q*~2~ + *Q*~3~ + g), missing variables such as water
> output can be found from equations for heat storage change (Δ*H*) (see
> Dingman, 2002, for examples). The equations for each phase of snowpack
> development (warming, ripening, and melting) are similar to those of
> simple melting ice.
>
> First the snow warms from below freezing to 0°C before it can begin

>
> *H*~1~ = - *c~i~*\*r*~w~*\*SWE\*(*T*~s~ - T~m~) (2--57)

> the density of water, SWE is the water equivalent depth of the snow,
> *T~s~* is the temperature of the snow, and *T~m~* is the melting-point
> temperature (0°C). This brings the snow- pack to the point where it
> can begin phase change; snow turns to retained water within while

> saturation, and the energy input required is
>
> *H*~2~ = u~ret~\**h~s~*\*r*~w~*\**L* (2--58) where u~ret~ is the
> maximum volumetric water content that the snow can retain,
>
> *h~s~* is the depth of the snow, and *L* is the latent heat of fusion
> (79.8 KJ/kg).
>
> Finally, water begins exiting the snowpack as the phase change contin-

>
> *H*~3~ = (SWE - *h*~wret~)\*r*~w~*\**L* (2--59)
>
> where *h*~wret~ is the depth of the retained water that is already
> melted (Ding- man, 2002).
>
> Adding *H*~1~, *H*~2~, and *H*~3~ results in the change in heat

> The National Weather Service (Anderson, 1973, 1976) has developed an

> data.
>
> **Degree-Day or Temperature-Index Melt Equations**
>
> Degree-day or temperature-index equations are empirical or can result
> from a linearization of the energy budget equation (Huber and
> Dickinson, 1988). The simplest equation used is
>
> *M* = *D~f~* (*T~i~* - *T~B~*), (2--61)
>
> where
>
> *M* = daily melt as a depth of water equivalent (in./day; mm/day),
>
> *T~i~* = index air temperature (°F; °C),
>
> *T~B~* = base melt temperature (°F; °C),
>
> *D~f~* = degree-day melt factor, (in./day-°F; mm/day-°C).
>
> Empirical degree-day factors range from 0.05 to 0.15 in./day-°F and
> can be determined by several equations, one of the simplest being
>
> *D~f~* = 0.011r*~s~*, (2--62)
>
> where *D~f~* is in units of mm/day-°C above 0°C and r*~s~* is the snow
> density in kg/ m^3^. This factor is affected by location, time of
> year, and meteorological condi- tions, and more complex equations may
> take into account vegetation transmis- sion for radiation, solar
> radiation, and snow albedo (Male and Gray, 1981).
>
> Equation (2--61) is basically a regression equation; ACOE (1956)
> results are shown in Figure 2--20. Either the maximum or average daily
> tem- perature for the portion over 0°C is usually used for the index
> air tempera- ture *T~i~*, and 0°C is most commonly used for *T~B~*
> (Gray and Prowse, 1993). However, base melt temperatures can be below

> Figure 2--20 should not be used for *T~i~* \< 34°F. The
> temperature-index approach is most useful and accurate under normal
> conditions and less so for extreme conditions. The ACOE developed a
> number of equations for generalized areas.
>
> The general equation used by the ACOE to calculate the amount of

> variables of the energy-balance and temper- ature-index models
> (Dingman, 2002). The final results show good accuracy for both models,
> although some years favored one over the other. During the melting
> phase, Anderson closely matched both snow--water equivalent (SWE) over
> time and daily water output with lysimeter and visual observation
> data. Although both models worked well, each requires detailed
> knowledge of the local environment and changes in conditions. The

> **Computation of Runoff from Snowmelt**
>
> Synthesis of runoff hydrographs associated with snowmelt can be short
> term, for a few days, or long term, for a complete melt season.
> Short-term forecast- ing is used in preparing operational plans for
> reservoirs or other flood con- trol works and for calculating design
> floods. To forecast a few days in advance, only the present condition
> of a snowpack and stream flow are required. Programs used to predict
> runoff from snowmelt include the ACOE Streamflow Synthesis and
> Reservoir Regulation (SSARR) and the U.S. NWS River Forecasting
> System, Snow Accumulation and Ablation Model. For long-term
> forecasting over a whole season, initial conditions are required as
> well as reliable predictions of meteorologic parameters.
>
> Snowmelt occurs only from those portions of a watershed covered by
> snow, and elevation is significant, since rates of snowmelt generally
> decrease with higher elevation due to a general reduction in
> temperature. Elevation effects can be considered by dividing a basin
> into a series of elevation zones, where the snow depth, losses, and
> snowmelt are assumed uniform in each. In most practical cases,
> snowmelt is estimated by the index methods presented in the previous
> section. The budget method itself is used in design flood studies.
> Once inflow water has been calculated, storage routing techniques are
> used to accommodate surface and ground water components, each with a
> different storage time and number of routing units. Storage routing
> methods are treated in detail in Chapter 4.
>
> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 2 presents the concept of rainfall--runoff analysis, or the
> conversion of pre- cipitation to runoff or streamflow, a central
> problem of engineering hydrology. Gross rainfall must be adjusted for
> losses to infiltration, evaporation, and depression stor- age to
> obtain rainfall excess, which equals direct runoff (DRO).
>
> The UH is defined as 1 in. (1 mm) of direct runoff generated uniformly
> over a basin for a specified period of rainfall and is a powerful
> method still used for many watershed studies. The concept of the UH
> allows for the conversion of rainfall ex- cess into a basin
> hydrograph, through a linear adding and lagging procedure called
> hydrograph convolution.
>
> UHs can be derived from actual storm data for gauged basins. Synthetic
> UHs represent theoretical or empirical approaches that can be applied
> to ungaged basins. These are most often used for the analysis of
> watersheds where limited gauging might exist. Most synthetic UH
> formulas relate parameters such as time to peak or lag time to
> measures of channel length, slope, watershed size, and watershed
> shape. A second rela- tion usually correlates peak flow to basin area
> and lag time. UHs are greatly affected by urban development and
> channelization, and UH techniques have been customized for local or
> regional conditions using statistical methods (Chapter 3). Several of
> the more popular UH methods are presented with examples, including
> Snyder, SCS, and Clark (TC & R), all contained within the HEC-HMS
> computer model (Chapter 5).
>
> Kinematic wave methods developed in the 1970s for overland flow hydro-
> graphs and channel hydrographs were based on solutions of the
> continuity and Man- ning's equation for a given geometry. Kinematic
> wave methods are now more useful with the current popularity of
> numerical methods and advanced hydrologic models, which include
> HEC-HMS from the U.S. ACOE Hydrologic Engineering Center (2006, 2010)
> and distributed hydrologic models (Vieux, 2002).
>
> Hydrologic losses are covered in detail in Chapter 2, including
> evaporation and ET for water bodies and vegetated surfaces. The Penman
> equation is presented along with a detailed example of its use.
> Infiltration loss is presented using both simple empiri- cal methods
> such as Horton and more physics-based methods such as Green and Ampt.
> Several examples and homework problems are included to cover these
> methods in detail. Chapter 2 also presents snowfall and snowmelt
> theory as it relates to the rain- fall--runoff process. The physics of
> snowmelt is briefly covered, and energy budget and empirical
> degree-day equations are shown that can be used to estimate melt rates
> in in./day or cm/day as a function of air temperature, snow
> temperature, and other fac- tors. Snowmelt can be a significant factor

> **CONCEPT CHECK**

1.  What characterizes a watershed?

2.  Describe the four assumptions made that are inherent to the unit
    hydrograph.

3.  What physical factors affect the shape and timing of the unit
    hydrograph?

4.  Discuss the parameters that describe the main timing aspects of the
    hydrograph.

5.  What two characteristics of the hydrograph do most methods for the
    synthetic unit hydrographs relate?

6.  In order to determine which of the three excavation sites could have
    potentially contributed to the sedimentation of the three lakes, it
    is necessary to determine the watershed boundaries and the
    contributing drainage areas of the system of lakes. Catchment basins
    (watersheds) can be determined by connecting ridge lines and
    dividing lines. Ridge lines will follow the elevation isocontours,
    and dividing lines are perpendicular to the elevation isocontours at
    the end and start at the confluences of streams. Using the map on
    the textbook website displaying the elevation data, determine the
    following:

    a.  How many confluences are displayed on the map?

    b.  Delineate the watersheds using the elevation isocontours. The
        > total drainage area of the study area is approximately 238
        > acres.

    c.  Determine which of the three lakes may be affected by
        > accelerated sedimentation.

    d.  Determine which of the three excavation sites may be responsible
        > for the accelerated sedimentation of the lakes.

7.  A watershed has the following characteristics:

> *A* = 2600 ac
>
> *L* = 5 mi.
>
> *S* = 53 ft/mi.
>
> *y* = 40%
>
> The channel is lined with concrete.
>
> The watershed is a residential area with 1/4-ac lots. The soil is
> categorized as soil group B. Assume that the average watershed slope
> is the same as the chan- nel slope. Determine the UH for this area for
> a storm duration of 1 hr using the SCS triangular UH method.

8.  Determine the storm hydrograph resulting from the rainfall pattern
    in Figure P2--8a using the triangular 1-hr UH given in Figure
    P2--8b.

a.  Using storm hydrograph, estimate the vol of runoff in inches over
    > the watershed.

b.  Estimate the vol of infiltration (in.).

c.  Estimate tp for the entire event.

```{=html}

```
12. Plot the hydrograph for the storm data given in Problem 1.22 (flow
    > rate vs. time). Label the following:

    a.  peak flow *Q~p~*,

    b.  time to peak *t~p~* (distance from the center of mass of
        > rainfall to the peak flow),

    c.  time of rise *T~R~* (distance from the start of discharge to the
        > peak flow),

    d.  time base *T~B~* (distance from the start of discharge to the
        > end of discharge).

13. Using the convolution equation, develop a storm hydrograph for the
    > rainfall intensity *i* and infiltration *f* given in the table (at
    > the end of each time step) using the 30-min unit hydrograph U
    > given below.

18. Develop a combined storm hydrograph at point *A* in the watershed
    (Fig. P2--18) and lag route (shift in time only) assuming that
    travel time from point *A* to *B* is exactly 2 hr.

19. Develop a storm hydrograph for subarea 3 from the given UH, add to
    the com- bined hydrograph from Problem 2.19, and produce a final
    storm hydrograph at the outlet of the watershed, *B*.

> Unit hydrograph for Subbasin C.

20. Redo Example 2--6 if the watershed is soil type B in good cover
    forest land. How does the forested area compare to the meadow UH?

21. Sketch the SCS triangular and curvilinear UHs and the mass curve for
    a 100-mi^2^ watershed which is 60% good condition meadow and 40%
    good cover forest land. The watershed consists of 70% soil group C
    and 30% soil group A. The average slope is 100 ft/mi, the rainfall
    duration is 3 hr, and the length to divide is 18 mi.

22. A small watershed has the characteristics given below. Find the peak
    discharge *Q~p~*, the basin lag time *t~p~*, and the time base of
    the unit hydrograph *T~b~*~,~ using Snyder's method.

> A = 200 mi.^2^; *C~t~* = 1.70; L = 27 mi.; L*~c~* = 15 mi.; C*~p~* =
> 0.7

23. For a 55 mi^2^ watershed with *C~t~* = 2.2, L = 15 mi., *L~c~* = 7
    mi., and *C~p~* = 0.5, find

> *t~p~*, *Q~p~*, *T~b~*, and D. Plot the resulting Snyder UH.

24. Watershed data are provided on Figure 1--22 for a small forested
    watershed that contains seven subareas as shown. Compute an SCS UH
    (dimensionless) for subarea B, based on lengths and areas from the
    watershed. Assume a wa- tershed slope of 0.5% and a CN = 70.

25. Assume the watershed in Example 2--5 has gone through extensive
    commercial and industrial growth on the wooded area. Now 50% of the
    formerly wooded areas have become urbanized, so of that portion, 40%
    is commercial and busi- ness and 60% is fair condition lawn space.
    Assume the soil is 50% group B and 50% group C for all areas. Using
    Figure 2--8, determine the runoff volume for a rainfall of 6 in.

26. Make sure that the unit hydrograph for subbasin C is a unit
    hydrograph (sub- basin C area = 770 ac). The unit hydrograph for
    subbasin C is graphed in Figure P2--27.

28. Using Figure 2--14, find the daily evaporation from a shallow lake
    > with the following characteristics:

> Mean daily temperature = 25.6°C, Daily solar radiation = 550
> cal/cm^2^,
>
> Mean daily dew point = 4.4°C,
>
> Wind movement (6 in. above pan) = 5.5 ft/s.

29. A class A pan is maintained near a small lake to determine daily
    evaporation (see table). The level in the pan is observed at the end
    of everyday. Water is added if the level falls *near* 7 in. For each
    day the difference in height level is calculated between the current
    and previous day, and the precipitation value is from the current
    day. Determine the daily lake evaporation if the pan coefficient is
    0.70.

30. Given an initial rate of infiltration equal to 1.5 in./hr and a
    final capacity of 0.5 in./hr, use Horton's equation \[Eq. (2--42)\]
    to find the infiltration capacity at the following times: *t* = 10
    min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 6 hr. You may assume a
    time constant *k* = 0.25/hr.

32. A 5-hr storm over a 15-ac basin produces a 5-in. rainfall: 1.2
    in./hr for the first hour, 2.1 in./hr for the second hour, 0.9
    in./hr for the third hour, and 0.4 in./hr for the last 2 hr.
    Determine the infiltration that would result from the Horton model
    with k = 1.1/hr, *f~c~* = 0.2 in./hr, and *f~o~* = 0.9 in./hr. Plot

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> **Scope of the Chapter**
>
> Many processes in hydrology must be analyzed and explained in a
> probabi- listic sense because of their inherent randomness. For
> instance, it is not pos- sible to predict streamflow and rainfall on a
> purely deterministic basis in either the past (hindcasting) or the
> future (forecasting), since it is impossible to know all their causal
> mechanisms quantitatively. Fortunately, statistical methods are
> available to organize, present, and reduce observed data to a form
> that facilitates their interpretation and evaluation. This chapter
> pres- ents methods by which the uncertainty in hydrologic data may be
> quantified and presented in a standard probabilistic framework. The
> primary objective is to relate the magnitude of a hydrologic event,
> such as a flood, to its prob- ability and vice versa. Within this
> chapter, the word "flood" is used generi- cally to mean the magnitude
> of a hydrologic event. Although actual flood data are used in
> examples, the same techniques may be applied to precipita- tion and
> many other hydrologic variables.
>
> **174**
>
> **Random Variables**
>
> A random variable is a parameter (e.g., streamflow, rainfall, stage)
> that can- not be predicted with certainty; that is, a random variable
> is the outcome of a random or uncertain process. Such variables may be
> treated statistically as either **discrete** or **continuous**. Most
> hydrologic data are continuous and are analyzed probabilistically
> using continuous frequency distributions. For example, values of flow
> in the hydrograph sketched in Figure 3--1(a) can equal any positive
> real number to the accuracy of the flow meter; that is, the data are
> continuous. However, the data themselves are often presented in a
> discrete form because of the measurement process. For example, daily
> streamflows might be estimated to the nearest cfs. This form of data
> presen- tation is called **quantized continuous**; that is, the
> continuous observations are assigned to discrete ranges. This is also
> illustrated in Figure 3--1(a), in which flows are assigned to the
> nearest cfs.
>
> Discrete random variables can take on values only from a specified
> domain of discrete values. For example, flipping a coin will produce
> either a head or a tail; rolling a die produces an integer from 1 to
> 6. The output from a tipping-bucket rain gage is a hydrologic example
> (Fig. 3--1(b)): There either is

> or is not a tip during any time interval. Quantized-continuous data
> could be treated as discrete; indeed, they are discretized whenever
> tabulated data are processed, since numerical values must be truncated
> (e.g., to the gage accuracy for flow or to the nearest 0.01 in. for
> rainfall). However, for frequency analysis this is usually very
> inconvenient because of the enormous range of values that would have
> to be considered. For example, if streamflows are measured to the
> nearest cfs and there is a range of flows from 0 to 5000 cfs, then
> 5000 discrete intervals would have to be considered. Approximating the
> record as continuous is much easier. Although discrete frequency
> distributions are sometimes applied to continuous variables (e.g.,
> storm rainfall depths), most applications of discrete distributions in
> hydrology are to a random variable that represents the *number* of
> events satisfying a certain criterion---for example, the number of
> floods expected to exceed a certain magnitude during a period of
> years.
>
> **Presentation of Data**
>
> A key assumption of frequency analysis is that the data are
> **independent**; that is, the magnitude of a future event does not
> depend upon the magnitude of past events. While underlying
> climatological mechanisms in hydrology, such as the El Niño--Southern
> Oscillation (ENSO), may affect long-term flow records, climatological
> cause-and-effect mechanisms are difficult to quantify (Tootle et al.,
> 2005). A qualitative judgment regarding the presence of a nonrandom
> pattern in the time series of hydrologic data can often be made on the
> basis of a plot of the time series (a time series is a record of
> magnitude vs. the time at which it occurs). For instance, a 75-yr
> record of the Siletz River near the western Oregon coast is shown in
> Figure 3--2. A 5-yr running average (the average of the given year and
> the four preceding years) is also shown, as

> visual indicators of flow changes that might indicate changes in the
> watershed or climatology of the region. Indeed, the Siletz River was
> chosen for this exam- ple largely because its watershed is relatively

> **nonstationarity** in the time series are illustrated in Figure 3--3.
> The statistical descriptors of the data (e.g., mean, variance) change
> in Figure 3--3(a) due to a linear trend---for example, due to
> urbaniza- tion or other development that increases runoff. Long-term
> cyclic trends are shown in Figure 3--3(b), perhaps due to
> climatological changes. The variance of the flows is reduced around
> 1970 in Figure 3--3(c), perhaps due to construc- tion of a dam
> upstream of the gage. Finally, the average flow decreases around 1970
> in Figure 3--3(d), perhaps due to upstream diversions. Formal methods
> for evaluating such changes or trends in time series are discussed by
> Priestly (1981), Helsel and Hirsch (1992), Salas (1993), and Chatfield
> (2003).

> presence of two or more causative mechanisms for the time series data.

> or a combination of both. The frequency characteristics of events with

> To aid in the selection of a fitted frequency distribution, quantized-
> continuous data are often presented in the form of a *bar chart,* or
> **histogram**. The height and general shape of the histogram are
> useful for characterizing the data and lend insight into the selection
> of a frequency distribution to be applied---for example, whether or
> not the distribution should be symmetric or skewed. Using streamflows
> as an example, the range of flows is first divided into **class
> intervals**, and the number of observations (**frequency**)
> corresponding to each class interval is tabulated. The width of the
> class inter- vals should be small enough so that the underlying
> pattern of the data may be seen but large enough so that such a
> pattern does not become confusing. The value used for the class
> interval can alter the viewer's impression of the data (Benjamin and
> Cornell, 1970); this value may conveniently be altered in many
> computer plotting programs so that the engineer can compare many
> different options. As an aid, Panofsky and Brier (1968) suggest
>
> *k* = 5 log~10~ *n*, (3--1)
>
> where *k* is the number of class intervals and *n* is the number of
> data values. Class intervals do not have to be of constant width if it
> is more convenient to group some data into a larger, aggregated
> interval.
>
> If the ordinates of the histogram are divided by the total number of
> observations, **relative frequencies** (probabilities) of each class
> interval result, such that the ordinates sum to 1.0, providing an
> alternative method of plot- ting the data. Still a third way is in the
> form of a **cumulative frequency dis- tribution**, which represents a
> summation of the histogram relative frequencies up to a given interval
> and is the probability that a value along the abscissa is less than or
> equal to the magnitude at that point. Both relative frequencies and
> cumulative frequencies are extensively used in hydrology and are best
> illustrated by an example.

> **PROBABILITY CONCEPTS**
>
> Consider an experiment with *N* possible outcomes, *X*~1~, *X*~2~, . .
> . , *X~i~*, . . . , *X~N~*. The outcomes are **mutually exclusive** if
> no two of them can occur simultane- ously. They are **collectively
> exhaustive** if they account for all possible out- comes of the
> experiment. The **probability** of an event *X~i~* may be defined as
>
> the relative number of occurrences of the event after a very large
> number of trials. This probability may be estimated as *P*(*X~i~*) =
> *n~i~ n*, where *n~i~* is the number of occurrences (frequency) of
> event *X~i~* in *n* trials. Thus, *n~i~ n* is the relative frequency
> or probability of occurrence of *X~i~*. (See Fig. 3--4.)
>
> A **discrete probability** is simply the probability of a discrete
> event. If one defines *P*(*X~i~*) as the probability of the random
> event *X~i~*, the following conditions hold on the discrete
> probabilities of these events when considered over the sample space of
> *N* possible outcomes:
>
> 0 ≤ *P*(*X~i~*) ≤ 1, (3--2)

*N*

> a *P*(*X~i~*) = 1. (3--3)
>
> *i* = 1
>
> The probability of the **union** (occurrence of either, symbolized by
> U) of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities of
> each:

*P*(*X*~1~ U *X*~2~) = *P*(*X*~1~) + *P*(*X*~2~). (3--4)

> Two events *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~ are **independent** if the occurrence of
> one does not influence the occurrence of the other. The probability of
> the **intersection** (occurrence of both, symbolized by ∩) of two
> independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ U *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~). (3--5)
>
> For events that are neither independent nor mutually exclusive,

*P*(*X*~1~ U *X*~2~) = *P*(*X*~1~) + *P*(*Y*~1~) - *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~).
(3--6)

> The conditional probability of event *X*~1~ given that event *Y*~1~
> has occurred is
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ \| *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~)\>*P*(*Y*~1~). (3--7)
>
> If events *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~ are independent, then Equations (3--5) and
> (3--7) com- bine to give

*P*(*X*~1~ \| *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~)\>*P*(*Y*~1~) =
*P*(*X*~1~). (3--8)

> which areas are proportional to probabilities, with the total area

> **RANDOM VARIABLES AND PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS**
>
> **CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES**
>
> Let event *Y*~1~ be the condition that a rainstorm occurs on a given
> day and event *X*~1~ be the condition that lightning is observed on a
> given day.
>
> Let probabilities of these events be
>
> *P*(*X*~1~) = 0.3 (Probability of lightning = 30%)
>
> *P*(*Y*~1~) = 0.1 (Probability of rain = 10%)
>
> *P*(*Y*~1~ \| *X*~1~) = 0.5 (If there is lightning, the conditional
> probability
>
> of rain is 50%)
>
> What is the probability that *both* rain and lightning occur (i.e.,
> the prob- ability of the intersection of *X*~1~ and *Y*~1~)? From
> Equation (3--7),
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~) = *P*(*Y*~1~ \| *X*~1~) . *P*(*X*~1~) = 0.15.
>
> But what if both events were independent, such that *P*(*Y*~1~ \|
> *X*~1~) =
>
> *P*(*Y*~1~) = 0.1? Then
>
> *P*(*X*~1~ ∩ *Y*~1~) = *P*(*X*~1~) . *P*(*Y*~1~) = 0.03.
>
> The probability of the joint occurrence of independent events will
> always be less than or equal to the probability of their joint
> occurrence if they are dependent.
>
> **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**
>
> The behavior of a random variable may be described by its probability
> dis- tribution. Every possible outcome of an experiment is assigned a
> numerical value according to a discrete **probability mass function**
> (PMF) or a continuous **probability density function (PDF)**. In
> hydrology, discrete random variables are most commonly used to
> describe the *number* of occurrences that satisfy a certain criterion,
> such as the number of floods that exceed a specified value or the
> number of storms that occur at a given location. Examples later in
> this chapter will be of this type. As a rule, discrete random
> variables are associ- ated with parameters that can assume only
> integer values. However, it is possible to round continuous variables
> to the nearest integer or to rescale to integers. For example, 2.18
> in. of rain is 218 hundredths of an inch of rain.
>
> Occasionally, it is convenient to treat a continuous variable in a
> dis- crete sense, as for the flows described in Figure 3--4. Let the
> notation *P*(*x*~1~)
>
> mean the probability that the random variable *X* takes on the value
> *x*~1~ { Δ*x*.
>
> From Figure 3--4, Δ*x* = 2500 cfs, or half of the class interval. Thus
> letting *X*
>
> represent "discrete" streamflows, we can assign relative frequencies
> from Figure 3--4:

*P*(7500) = 0.013, *P*(27,500) = 0.093,

*P*(12,500) = 0.173, *P*(32,500) = 0.080,

> *P*(17,500) = 0.360, *P*(37,500) = 0.000,
>
> *P*(22,500) = 0.267, *P*(42,500) = 0.013.
>
> Note that these values satisfy the probability axioms of Equations
> (3--2) and (3--3). Furthermore, for discrete probabilities,
>
> *P*(*a* ≤ *x* ≤ *b*) = a *P*(*x~i~*). (3--9)
>
> *a* ≤ *x~i~* ≤ *b*
>
> The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) is defined as
>
> *F*(*x*) = *P*(*X* ≤ *x*) = a *P*(*x~i~*). (3--10)

> **Fitting a Distribution to Data**
>
> An intuitive use for moment estimates is to fit probability
> distributions to data by equating the moment estimates obtained from
> the data to the func- tional form for the distribution. For example,
> the normal distribution has parameters mean m and variance s^2^. The
> **method of moments** fit for the normal distribution is simply to use
> the estimates from the data for the mean and variance. As another
> example, the parameter l of the exponential dis- tribution is equal to
> the reciprocal of the mean of the distribution. Hence,
>
> the method of moments fit is l = 1 m .
>
> Graphical methods and the **method of maximum likelihood** are two
> alternative procedures to the method of moments for fitting
> distributions to data. Graphical methods will be discussed in Section
> 3.6. Although the method of maximum likelihood is superior to the
> method of moments by some statistical measures, it is generally much
> more computationally com- plex and is beyond the scope of this text.
> Maximum likelihood methods for several distributions used in hydrology
> are presented by Kite (1977). Graph- ical methods will be illustrated
> later.
>
> Finally, alternatives exist to use of the product-moment estimates
> given in this section for variance \[Eq. (3--38)\] and skewness \[Eq.
> (3--40)\]. So-called **L-moments** (L for "linear") are linear
> combinations of the ordered
>
> (ranked) samples of a variable (Hosking and Wallis, 1997). Among other
> advantages, because no powers ("products") of samples are used in the
> com- putation, L-moments are less subject to bias in estimation.
> However, they are not a part of the Bulletin 17-B (IACWD, 1982)
> procedure and will not be described herein. Applications to parameter
> estimation are shown by Stedinger et al. (1993) and Hosking and Wallis
> (1997).
>
> The main objective of determining a distribution's parameters is usu-
> ally to evaluate its CDF. In some cases, however, the same purpose may
> be accomplished without calculating the actual distribution
> parameters. Instead, the distribution is evaluated using a frequency
> factor *K*, defined as
>
> *K* = [*x* - *x*]{.underline}. (3--43)

*S~x~*

> The value of *K* is a function of the desired value for the CDF and
> may also be a function of the skewness. Hence, if *K*(*F*, *C~s~*) is
> known for the calculated skewness and desired CDF value, the
> corresponding magnitude of *x* can be calculated. Frequency factors
> will be illustrated subsequently for several of the distributions to
> be discussed.
>
> The most common means used in hydrology to indicate the probability of
> an event is to assign a **return period**, or **recurrence interval**,
> to the event. The return period is defined as follows:
>
> An annual maximum event has a return period (or recurrence interval)
> of *T* years if its magnitude is equaled or exceeded once, *on the
> average*, every *T* years. The reciprocal of *T* is the exceed- ance
> probability, 1 - *F*, of the event---that is, the probability that the
> event is equaled or exceeded in any one year.
>
> Thus, the 50-yr flood has a probability of 0.02, or 2%, of being
> equaled or exceeded in any single year. It is imperative to realize
> that the return period implies nothing about the actual time sequence
> of an event. The 50-yr flood does not occur like clockwork once every
> 50 yr. Rather, one expects that on the average, about twenty 50-yr
> floods will be experienced during a 1000-yr period. There could in
> fact be two 50-yr floods in a row (with probability

2.  \* 0.02 = 0.0004 for independent events). For this reason, labeling
    a 50-yr flood as a "2% flood" is often a clearer indication to the
    public as to its true likelihood of occurrence in any one year.

> The concept of a return period implies independent events and is usu-
> ally found by analyzing the series of maximum annual floods (or
> rainfalls, etc.). The largest event in one year is assumed to be
> independent of the larg- est event in any other year. But it is also
> possible to apply such an analysis to the *n* largest independent
> events from an *n*-yr period, regardless of the year in which they
> occur. In this case, if the second largest event in one year was

> Return periods may be assigned to minimum events (e.g., droughts) in

> Return periods need not be limited to units of years. As long as the

> rainfall thus has a probability of 1 6 of being equaled or exceeded in
> any one month.
>
> A further option is to use all the data in the historic time series,
> whether or not they are independent. This is called the **complete
> series**; an example is the series of 365 daily average streamflows.
> Note that the maximum daily average streamflow is not necessarily the
> maximum flow for the day, since the U.S. Geological Survey records
> hourly or 15-min values and determines the maximum flow as the highest
> recorded value and the daily average as the average of the 24 or 96
> recorded values. Frequency information derived from such a complete
> series is usually shown in a **flow-duration curve** (Searcy, 1959),
> which is a plot of magnitude vs. percentage of time the mag- nitude is
> equaled or exceeded (Fig. 3--12). The information from such an
> analysis cannot be directly related to return period, since the values
> in the complete series are not necessarily independent; for example,
> day-to-day average streamflow values are highly correlated.

> **The Binomial Distribution**
>
> It is common to examine a sequence of independent events for which the

> consists of Bernoulli trials, independent trials for which the
> probability of success at each trial is a con- stant *p*. The binomial
> distribution answers the question: What is the prob- ability of
> exactly *x* successes in *n* Bernoulli trials? This will be the only
> discrete distribution considered in this text; it is very commonly
> used in hydrology.
>
> The probability that there will be *x* successes followed by *n* - *x*
> fail- ures is just the product of the probabilities of the *n*
> independent events: *p^x^*(1 - *p*)^*n*-*x*^. But this represents just
> one possible sequence for *x* successes and *n* - *x* failures; all
> possible sequences must be considered, including those in which the
> successes do not occur consecutively. The number of pos- sible ways

> **EXAMPLE 3--7**

> **CRITICAL FLOOD DESIGN**
>
> Consider the 50-yr flood 1*p* = 0.022.

a.  What is the probability that at least one 50-yr flood will occur
    > during the 30-yr lifetime of a flood control project? This is just
    > the risk of failure discussed above, and the distribution of the
    > number of failures is *B*(30, 0.02). Thus, from Equation (3--51),

> Risk = 1 - (1.0 - 0.02)^30^
>
> = 1 - 0.98^30^
>
> = 1 - 0.545
>
> = 0.455.
>
> If this risk is too great, the engineer might design for the 100-yr
> event for which the risk is
>
> Risk = 1 - 0.99^30^ = 0.26
>
> and the reliability is 0.74. For this latter circumstance, there is a
> 26% chance of occurrence of the 100-yr event over the 30-yr life- time
> of the project.
>
> When it is not possible to reduce the risk to a desired level by
> designing for a high (but hypothetical) return period event, an
> alternative is to design for the **probable maximum flood**, which is
> the flood that results from the **probable maximum precipitation
> (PMP)** event. The PMP is the highest precipitation likely to occur
> under known meteorological conditions (Smith, 1993; Mays, 2001)
>
> and has been computed for most areas of the United States by the
> National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center
> ([http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/studies/pmp.html).](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/studies/pmp.html))

b.  What is the probability that the 100-yr flood will not occur in 10
    > yr? In 100 yr?

For *n* = 10, *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - *P*)^10^ = 0.99^10^ = 0.904,

For *n* = 100, *P*(*x* = 0) = (1 - *p*)^100^ = 0.99^100^ = 0.37.

> Thus, there is a 37% chance (37% reliability) that the 100-yr flood

> **The Lognormal Distribution**
>
> Consider a hypothetical runoff calculation, in which runoff is equal
> to the *product* of functions of several random factors, such as
> rainfall, contributing area, loss coefficient, and evaporation. In
> general, if a random variable *x* results from the product of a large
> number of other random variables (i.e., a "multiplicative mechanism"),
> then the distribution of the logarithm of *x* will approach normality,
> since the logarithm of *x* will consist of the sum of the logs of the
> contributing factors. In hydrology, it is easy to conceive of many
> contributing factors to runoff that are inherently random and about
> which there is very little deterministic information. Hence, a
> multiplicative mechanism for runoff may be a very reasonable
> assumption. In general, a random variable has a **lognormal**
> distribution if the log of the random vari- able is distributed
> normally. For example, if *y* = log *x* and if *y* is distributed
> normally, then *x* is distributed lognormally.
>
> The lognormal PDF is sketched in Figure 3--15. Because it is bounded
> on the left by zero, has a positive skewness, and is easily used
> through its relationship to the normal, it is widely applied in
> hydrology. The skewness is a function of the coefficient of variation:

> *g* = 3*CV* + *CV*^3^. (3--60)

> The skewness of the transformed variable *y* is, of course, zero,
> since *y* is distributed normally.

(a) What is the 100-yr flood?

> *y*~100~ = 4.29209 + 2.326 . 0.12905 = 4.5923
>

and

>
> This value is much higher than the estimate (34,620 cfs) from the

(b) What is the probability that a flow will be less than or equal to
    > 30,000 cfs?

> Although ordinary graph paper could be used to plot the CDF vs. the

The frequency factor *K* \[Eq. (3--43)\] serves as the required function

*h*(*F*) as long as it is not also a function of skewness. For example,

> but these tests are seldom helpful in discriminating among different
> distributions, because their confidence limits are so large that both
> tend to lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that the distribution
> fits the data. See, for example, the very wide 90% confidence
> intervals plotted in Figure 3--18 using the *KS* statistic. An
> alternative is to use heuristic measures of goodness of fit, such as
> the average of absolute values of deviations between the fitted and
> plotted CDF (Benson, 1968). Another possibility is to include the
> third and fourth moments of the data in the analysis, since these may
> be used to categorize different distribu- tions (Harr, 1977). But the
> problems of estimation of higher moments have already been discussed.
> Better alternatives (in the sense of greater discrimina- tion among
> alternative distributions) are the probability plot correlation coef-
> ficient method and L-moment tests, summarized by Stedinger et al.
> (1993). In the end, the decision is often subjective and based on a
> preference for the underlying mechanism of one distribution vs.
> another. That is, the engineer may prefer the multiplicative mechanism
> of the lognormal distribution or the empiricism of the gamma or log
> Pearson type 3 distributions.
>
> Graphical comparison of the fitted and plotted CDFs is of considerable
> use in the decision. King (1971) has shown the form that several CDFs
> exhibit when plotted on the probability paper of another distribution,
> and Reich and Renard (1981) apply these shapes to hydrology. For
> example, if the data are plotted on lognormal paper and a Gumbel
> distribution fits the data, the data should appear with curvature.
> Unfortunately, the gamma and log Pearson 3 distributions cannot be
> assessed in this manner, since they have no probability paper.
>
> Instead of trying several distributions and attempting to select the
> best fit, one could simply accept the recommendations of the U.S.
> IACWD (1982) (formerly the U.S. Water Resources Council; Benson,
>
> 1968\) that the LP3 distribution is best suited for flood frequency
> analysis. On the other hand, the log-Gumbel (extreme-value type II)
> was deter- mined by the Natural Environment Research Council (1975) to
> be pref- erable for flood frequency analysis in Great Britain.
> Individual rivers are likely to vary in their optimal distribution,
> and the question of which distribution to use for floods and myriad
> other hydrologic variables will always remain open.
>
> **GRAPHICAL COMPARISON OF FOUR DISTRIBUTIONS**
>
> Which distribution is best for the data for the Siletz River? One very
> qualitative assessment can be made from the four PDFs shown in Fig-
> ure 3--15. From the figure, we see little difference among them. How-
> ever, common practice is to compare the CDFs on probability paper; and
> for this purpose, all the distributions may be plotted together on
> lognormal paper for another qualitative assessment. Several predicted
> magnitudes are needed, since all but the lognormal will plot as smooth
> curves. These calculations are shown in Table 3--8 (including more
> than just the required two points for the lognormal). The resulting
> plots are shown in Figure 3--19 along with selected data points (only
> every fifth data point is plotted in the middle of the distribution,
> in order to have a better view of the four fitted distributions).

> ![](./images/media/image209.png)It is important to realize that, were
> confidence limits shown (as on Fig. 3--18), they would be very wide at
> the upper limit of the CDF, reflect- ing the uncertainty of predicting
> the magnitude of, say, the 100-yr flood from only 75 yr of data. The
> uncertainty can be quantified by computing the standard deviation of
> the estimates at the extremes, using a different procedure for each
> distribution (Kite, 1977; Stedinger et al., 1993). One way to reduce
> the uncertainty is to use a longer period of record (not pos- sible)
> or a regional analysis, in which regional streamflow data are
>
> aggregated and used in a regression-type analysis (Section 3.7). The
> National Research Council (1988) study describes several options for
> improvements of frequency estimates, including regional analysis,
> better structure in models, and focusing on the upper extremes (for
> floods).
>
> Finally, plots such as Figure 3--19 can be used to interpolate for
> flood frequencies for the gamma and LP3 distributions, as suggested in
> Examples 3--12 and 3--13, in lieu of the use of tables or spreadsheet
> functions. Given the uncertainty inherent in flood frequency
> estimates, two-significant- figure accuracy from a plot is generally
> accurate enough. For instance, the nonexceedance probability of a flow
> of 30,000 cfs is approximately 93% by any of the four distributions,
> with a corresponding return period of about 14 years.

> **Computer Programs**
>
> All the computations, tables, and figures in this chapter were
> prepared eas- ily in Excel. Functions for obtaining the cumulative
> normal distribution and its inverse and the cumulative gamma
> distribution and its inverse are par- ticularly helpful. On the other
> hand, preparation of probability paper plots of the type of Figures
> 3--18 and 3--19 takes more effort, since the vertical lines of the
> probability scale must be inserted ("drawn") and labeled by the user.
> Nonetheless, the task is straightforward.
>
> Flood frequency software is available from various sources. The Hydro-
> logical Frequency Analysis (HFA) program may be purchased as an
> adjunct to the text by Bobée and Ashkar (1991) for analysis and
> probability plots of various formulations of the gamma and LP3
> distributions. The Bulletin 17B procedure of the IACWD (1982) has been
> programmed by the Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering
> Center (HEC), and is available as the program HEC-SSP (HEC Statistical
> Software Package). See the HEC web- site
> (<http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/)> for information about how to obtain
> the software. A similar program for Bulletin 17B analysis, PEAKFQ, has
> been prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey and may be downloaded from
> its website,
> [http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/surface_water.](http://water.usgs.gov/software/lists/surface_water)
> At the same location, the program SWSTAT may be downloaded, which
> performs many different kinds of statistical and related analyses on
> time-series data, includ- ing preparation of flow-duration curves,
> trend analysis, and a simplified form of the Bulletin 17B analysis.
>
> Flood frequency estimates illustrated in this chapter rely upon a
> record of flows measured at one station. The shorter the record, the
> more uncer- tainty in the frequency estimates. See, for example, how
> the *KS* values of Table 3--6 increase with decreasing *n.* **Regional
> analysis** is one way in which problems of short records are
> addressed. A summary of literature is pro- vided by Stedinger et al.

> **REGIONAL ANALYSIS**
>
> Hosking and Wallis (1997). One alternative is to perform regional
> esti- mates of key statistics, such as skewness, illustrated with the
> discussion of Figure 3--10. Another alternative is a regional
> regression: *T*-year floods are computed for as many streams as
> possible using the LP3 distribution, sometimes with the aid of
> simulation models, and their magnitudes regressed against catchment
> characteristics. The relationship often takes the form of a multiple
> regression analysis (power-function form), in which catchment area is
> usually the most important independent variable. In this way,
> uncertainty in a short-record-length estimate at one station is bal-
> anced against a longer-record estimate at other stations. Such
> relationships are also good ways in which to estimate flood peaks at
> ungaged locations. The U.S. Geological Survey has prepared these
> relationships for many locations in the United States. Examples
> include Harris et al. (1979) and Cooper (2005) for western Oregon,
> Sauer et al. (1983) for urban areas in the United States, Laenen
> (1983) for urban areas in western Oregon, and Franklin and Losey
> (1984) for Tallahassee, Florida. An automated pro- gram, NFF (for
> National Flood Frequency), which incorporates all pub- lished results
> for the United States, has been published by the USGS (Ries and
> Crouse, 2002). Local offices of the USGS should be contacted for
> access to studies for specific regions.
>
> The nationwide urban equations of Sauer et al. (1983) depend on local
> estimates of rural peaks and cannot be demonstrated here. However, as
> an example, the USGS (Franklin and Losey, 1984) has performed a flood
> fre- quency analysis on 15 basins in the Tallahassee, Florida, area
> using a com- bination of continuous simulation and regression. The
> resulting regression equation for most of the Tallahassee area is
>
> *Q~p~*(*T*) = *C~p~A^a^IA^b^*, (3--82)
>
> where
>
> *Q~p~* = predicted flood peak for return period *T* (cfs),
>
> *A* = drainage area (mi^2^),
>
> *IA* = impervious area as percentage of total area *A*,
>
> and *C~p~*, *a*, and *b* are coefficients that are functions of return
> period, as given in Table 3--9. The 15 basins ranged from 0.2 to 16
> mi^2^ and imperviousness ranged from 5.8% to 54%. Coefficients of
> determination (*R*^2^) for the multiple regression ranged from 0.97 to
> 0.99 for the indicated equations, but standard errors of estimate were
> 18% to 30%. That is, there is a 68% chance (one standard deviation on
> either side of the mean, for the normal distribution) that the unknown
> "true" flood estimate will fall within 18% to 30% of the true mean.
> The regression predictions are mainly for use in ungaged catch- ments.
> For example, for the 3.44 mi^2^ McGinnis Arm Catchment in Tallahas-
> see, the imperviousness percentage is 28.3, for which Equation (3--82)
> yields a 10-yr peak flow of 1850 cfs.

>
> This chapter contains only a sampling of possible topics in frequency

> estimation procedures by the method of maximum likelihood and
> L-moments (see Section 3.3), and confidence limits and uncertainty
> (see Section 3.6). The reader may refer to the cited references for
> ad- ditional information.
>
> In this chapter, introductory definitions related to description of
> data and probability theory are followed by methods for fitting
> theoretical frequency distri- butions to measured data. One discrete
> and five continuous distributions are de- scribed and applied. The
> emphasis is on flood frequency analysis, but the procedures can be
> applied to any set of independent hydrologic data, such as rainfall,
> stage, annual flow volumes, temperatures, and water quality
> parameters. Apart from the recommended use of the log-Pearson 3
> distribution for flood frequency analysis in
>
> the United States (IACWD, 1982), there is no consensus regarding
> distributions most suited to any particular variable; however, for
> storm runoff quality, studies have shown that storm runoff event mean
> concentrations (i.e., flow-weighted av- erage storm event
> concentrations) are almost universally distributed lognormally
> (Driscoll, 1986).
>
> Although most of the distributions discussed can also be applied to
> minima (e.g., droughts), the parameter estimates may vary from those
> given for the maxima to accommodate the possible negative skewness of
> the droughts. For use of any dis- tribution other than the normal for
> minima, reference should be made to Gumbel (1958), Benjamin and
> Cornell (1970), Stedinger et al. (1993), or Haan (2002) for parameter
> estimation.

1.  This chapter employs Siletz River data for the continuous period
    1925--1999. As of this writing, peak flow data through water year
    2010 are available on the USGS Oregon surface water data webpage
    [http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/sw,](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/or/nwis/sw)
    including for Gage Number 14305500, which is the Siletz River. You
    will be asked in different problems in this chapter to update the
    Chapter 3 examples by using the 86-yr record, 1925--2010.

    a.  Download the peak flow data for the Siletz River, and enter the
        > data into a spreadsheet.

    b.  Plot the 86 years of peak flows (1925--2010) and a 5-yr running
        > mean vs. their water year, to update Figure 3--2. Comment in
        > general about the appearance of this time series, in the
        > manner of the discussion of Figure 3--2.

    c.  Using the updated data, develop new relative frequency and
        > cumulative frequency histograms; that is, update Figures 3--4
        > and 3--5.

2.  \(a\) Use the data found in Problem 3.1 to calculate the mean,
    standard devia- tion, and skew coefficient (Eqs. 3--37, 3--38, and

(b) Repeat part (a) using the logs (base 10) of the Siletz River data.

(c) Develop the weighted skewness of the logs according to the Bulletin
    > 17B protocol. That is, redo Example 3--3. At the conclusion of
    > this problem, you should have an updated version of Table 3--2.

    1.  A temporary cofferdam is being designed to protect a 5-yr
        construction project from the 30-yr flood. What is the
        probability that the cofferdam will be overtopped:

        a.  at least once during the 5-yr project,

        b.  not at all during the project,

        c.  in the first year only,

        d.  in the fourth year and fifth year exactly?

5.  This problem asks you to perform a descriptive analysis using real
    > data of inter- est to you. The problem should be done using
    > spreadsheet or similar software.

    a.  Download a series of annual maximum flows for a river of
        > interest to you. USGS data may be obtained starting at the
        > website <http://water.usgs.gov/> nwis/. Import the data into
        > your spreadsheet or similar software. Convert the lines of
        > text data into columnar data.

    b.  Note the characteristics of the basin from its description in
        > the USGS files. What are the basin area and latitude and
        > longitude of the gage? Are there diversions, controls, or
        > storage (e.g., reservoirs) upstream?

    c.  Plot the time series of peak flows and log~10~ (flows) vs. water
        > year. The series of log~10~ (flows) should have a lower
        > coefficient of variation. Does the shape of the time-series
        > plot of flows suggest that the time-series of river peak flows
        > is nonstationary? If so, discuss possible reasons.

    d.  Compute and plot relative-frequency histograms for the flows and
        > log (flows). Discuss any difference in skewness evident from
        > the two plots.

    e.  Compute the following statistics for the series of flows and for
        > the series of log~10~ (flows): number, average, unbiased
        > variance, unbiased standard deviation, coefficient of
        > variation, unbiased skewness, maximum, and minimum.

6.  For the data of Problem 3.25, compute a weighted skew coefficient
    according to the Bulletin 17B method.

7.  For the data of Problem 3.25, fit a log Pearson 3 distribution to
    the peak flows, using the method of moments described in this text.
    Use the weighted skew coefficient computed in Problem 3.26.

    a.  Compute estimated flows for return periods listed in Table 3--4.

    b.  Plot the fitted CDF on lognormal probability paper.

    c.  Using the Cunnane plotting-position formula (with parameter *a*
        > = 0.4), plot enough of the measured flows to provide a
        > comparison similar to Figure 3--19. Discuss the fit.

8.  Repeat Problem 3.27 using the lognormal and three-parameter gamma
    distributions.

9.  For a station of interest to you, download 10 yr of daily average
    streamflow data from the USGS website
    [http://water.usgs.gov/nwis/.](http://water.usgs.gov/nwis/) Paste
    the data into a spreadsheet and convert the text data to columns.
    Construct and plot a flow- duration curve for these data. From the
    table and chart, what are the flows equaled or exceeded 20%, 50%,
    and 90% of the time?

10. Interevent times for winter storms arriving at Corvallis, Oregon,
    for the months November through April for the winters of 1996--97,
    1997--98, and 1998--99 were determined, and a frequency histogram
    prepared as shown in the table below. The average interevent time
    was 2.59 days.

    a.  Fit an exponential distribution to these data by finding the
        > parameter l.

    b.  Plot the relative-frequency histogram and the fitted exponential
        > PDF on the same chart. Care may need to be taken to be sure
        > that the histogram and PDF are properly aligned. Each day
        > (0--1, 1--2, and so on) is a class interval.

    c.  From the relative-frequency histogram, compute the
        > cumulative-frequency histogram and plot on arithmetic graph
        > paper.

    d.  On two-cycle semilog paper (or using spreadsheet options for
        > log-scales), plot the empirical CDF from part (c) and the
        > fitted CDF. On this "prob- ability paper," values should be
        > plotted at the class mark, centering on

> half-days. The empirical values from part (c) should be plotted as
> individual points, and one fitted CDF (exceedance probability) should
> be plotted as a straight line.

e.  What is the probability that the time between winter storms is ≤ 3
    > days? Compute using both the empirical CDF and the fitted CDF.

12. Using statistics for Siletz River peak flows, 1979--1999 (Table

    b.  Verify that the mean and unbiased standard deviation for the

> The movement of a flood wave down a channel or through a reservoir and
> the associated change in timing or attenuation of the wave constitute
> an important topic in floodplain hydrology. It is essential to
> understand the theoretical and practical aspects of flood routing to
> predict the temporal and spatial variations of a flood wave through a
> river reach or reservoir. Flood routing methods can also be used to
> predict the outflow hydrograph from a watershed subjected to a known
> amount of precipitation.
>
> The **storage routing** concept is most easily understood by referring
> to Figure 4--1. Inflow and outflow hydrographs for a small
> level-surface reser- voir have been plotted on the same graph. Area
> *A* represents the volume of water that fills available storage up to
> time *t*~1~. Inflow exceeds outflow and the reservoir is filling. At
> time *t*~1~, inflow and outflow are equal and the maximum storage is
> reached. For times exceeding *t*~1~, outflow exceeds inflow and the
> reservoir empties. Area *C* represents the volume of water that flows
> out of the reservoir and must equal area *A* if the reservoir begins
> and ends at the same level. The peak of the outflow from a reservoir
> should intersect the inflow hydrograph as shown in Figure 4--1, since,
> in general, the outflow is uniquely determined by reservoir storage or

a.  Determine the average storage for each one-day period (Δ*t* = 1
    > day). Graph storage vs. time for the reservoir for the event.
    > Assume that *S*~0~ = 0 (the reservoir is initially empty).

b.  What is the (approximate) maximum storage reached during this storm
    > event?

> River routing differs from reservoir routing in that storage in a
> river reach of length *L* depends on more than just outflow. The peak
> of the out- flow hydrograph from a reach is usually attenuated and
> delayed compared with that of the inflow hydrograph. Because storage
> in a river reach is a function of whether stages are rising or
> falling, storage in this case is a func- tion of both outflow and
> inflow for the routing reach (see Section 4.3). Also, as river stages
> rise high enough to inundate a floodplain beyond the banks of the
> channel, significant velocity reductions are observed in the
> floodplain compared with the main channel. Example 4--2 presents
> differences between river and reservoir routing.

> **Hydrologic Routing Methods**
>
> Routing techniques may be classified in two major categories: simple
> **hydro- logic routing** and more complex **hydraulic routing**.
> Hydrologic routing involves the balancing of inflow, outflow, and
> volume of storage through the use of the continuity equation. A second
> relationship, the storage--discharge relation, is also required
> between outflow rate and storage in the system. Applications of
> hydrologic routing techniques to problems of flood predic- tion, flood
> control measures, reservoir design and operation, watershed
> simulation, and urban design are numerous. Many computer models are
>
> available that take input rainfall, convert it to outflow hydrographs,
> and then route the hydrographs through complex river or reservoir
> networks using hydrologic routing methods. These applications are
> presented in detail in Chapters 5 and 6.
>
> **Hydraulic Routing Methods**
>
> Hydraulic routing is more complex and accurate than hydrologic
> routing. It is based on the solution of the continuity equation and
> the momentum equa- tion for unsteady flow in open channels. Usually
> solved by explicit or implicit numerical methods on a computer, these
> differential equations are known as the Saint Venant equations, first
> derived in 1871, for which no closed-form solutions exist.
>
> Unsteady flow in rivers, reservoirs, and estuaries is caused by motion
> of long waves due to tides, flood waves, storm surges, and dynamic
> reservoir releases. These types of wave forms can be adequately
> described only by the one-dimensional Saint Venant equations, which
> are presented in detail in Section 4.4. In many cases, the governing
> equations can be simplified to a one-dimensional continuity equation
> and a uniform flow relationship, referred to as **kinematic wave
> routing**, which implies that discharge can be computed as a simple
> function of depth alone. In 1981, kinematic wave rout- ing was added
> to the HEC-HMS flood hydrograph package with a numerical solver, as
> described in Section 4.6.
>
> Uniform flow implies a balance between gravitational and frictional
> forces in the channel. This assumption cannot always be justified,
> especially on very flat slopes where effects of water surface slope
> cannot be ignored. Cases where other terms in the momentum equation
> for hydraulic routing must be retained include (1) upstream movement
> of tides and storm surges,

(2) backwater effects from downstream reservoirs and tributary inflows,

(3) flood waves in channels of very flat slope (2--3 ft/mi), and (4)
    > abrupt waves caused by sudden releases from reservoirs or dam
    > failures. For these cases, the complete solution of the Saint
    > Venant equations should be used. Several computer models exist to
    > solve these equations.

> **HYDROLOGIC RIVER ROUTING**
>
> As a flood wave passes through a river reach, the peak of the outflow
> hydrograph is usually attenuated and delayed due to channel resistance
> and storage capacity. Considering a lumped storage approach for the
> reach, the difference between the ordinates of the inflow and outflow
> hydrographs, represented by shaded areas in Figure 4--2, is equal to
> the rate of change of storage in the reach, as shown in Equation
> (4--1). The value of Δ*S* Δ*t* in the continuity equation is positive
> when storage is increasing and negative when storage is decreasing,
> and *S* can be plotted as a function of time. Equation (4--1) can be
> written in finite-difference

> equation, where *a* and *n* are constants. Storage in the reach is
> related to *by^m^*, where *b* and *m* are constants that depend on the
> cross section of the channel. The parameter *x* defines the relative

>
> The Muskingum method assumes that flow and storage are both related to
> depth such that *m n* = 1 and *b a* = *K*, the travel time, resulting

> *S* = *K*\[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\], (4--4)
>

> *K* = travel time constant for the reach,
>
> *x* = weighting factor, which varies from 0 to 0.5 for a given reach.
>
> For the case of linear reservoir routing where *S* depends only on
> outflow, *x* = 0 in Equation (4--4). In smooth uniform channels, *x* =
> 0.5 yields equal weight to inflow and outflow, which theoretically
> results in pure translation of the wave. A typical range for most

> To determine Muskingum coefficients, we guess a value of *x* and then
> plot \[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\] vs. *S*. The one plot that comes closest
> to being a straight line is chosen to determine the coefficient
> values. The average value is *x* = 0.2 for a natural stream.
> Therefore, we assume that *x* must lie between
>
> 0.1 and 0.3. Plots of \[*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*\] vs. *S* are made for *x*
> = 0.1, *x* = 0.2, and *x* = 0.3 using the values listed in Table E4--4
> (see Fig. E4--4).

The lower outflow is an 18-in. reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) that will
be assumed to behave as an orifice with an entrance loss coefficient,
*C~d~*, of 0.9:

*Q*orifice = *CdAo* 22*gh*,

> where
>
> *Q*~orifice~ = orifice outflow (cfs or cms),
>
> *C~d~* = orifice entrance loss coefficient,
>
> *A~o~* = orifice area = p*D*^2^ 4 for a circular pipe of diameter *D*,
> *g* = gravitational acceleration (32.2 ft/s^2^ or 9.8 m/s^2^), and
>
> *h* = depth above the orifice centerline (ft or m).
>
> The ogee spillway is assumed to behave like a weir (Davis, 1952;
> French, 1985) with equation
>
> *Q*~weir~ = *C~e~* 12\>32 22*g L*1*h* - *h*~0~21.5,
>
> where
>
> *Q*~weir~ = spillway discharge (cfs or cms),
>
> *C~e~* = weir discharge coefficient,
>
> *L* = weir length (perpendicular to discharge) (ft or m), and
>
> *h*~0~ = elevation of weir crest (ft or m).
>
> For this example, *D* = 1.5 ft, *C~d~* = 0.9, *C~e~* ≈ 0.7 (Davis,
> 1952), *L* = 15 ft, and *h*~0~ = 5 ft. The orifice and weir outflows
> are assumed to obey the indicated equations even for low heads. The
> stage--discharge analysis
>
> could be refined in the event that this assumption must be modified.
> The sum of the orifice and weir outflows constitutes a **rating
> curve** for the small reservoir. The rating curve could be tabular or
> derived from exper- iments in lieu of equations such as those for the
> orifice and weir.
>
> Using the depth, storage, and outflow relationships developed in the
> table, route the hydrograph through the reservoir. What is the maximum
> height reached in the reservoir for this inflow? Use Δ*t* = 10 min.

> **SOLUTION**
>
> There are two steps to the solution: In step 1, we develop a storage-
> indication curve from the indicated geometry and outflow
> relationships. This will involve additional computations to determine
> storage vs. depth. Step 2 is the routing procedure using the
> continuity equation and the storage-indication curve.
>
> The geometry of the trapezoids results in the surface areas shown in
> the table. Storage (volume) *S* is the integral of surface area *A*:
>
> *S* = 1*A dh*.
>
> The integration is performed numerically in the table, using the
> **trapezoi- dal rule**. In this case, incremental volumes are computed
> by assuming the function *A h* can be approximated as a series of
> trapezoids with sides *A~i~* and *A~i~*~+1~ and width Δ*h*. Then the
> incremental volume is
>
> Δ*S [Ai ]{.underline}*[+ *Ai* + 1]{.underline} Δ*h*.
>
> 2
>
> Thus, the incremental volume between depth 2 ft and 3 ft is

Δ*S* =

> 9233 ft^2^ + 11,064 ft^2^
>
> 2
>
> . 1 ft = 10,148 ft^3^.
>
> Cumulative volume is simply the sum of the incremental volumes. Note
> that the elevation increment Δ*h* need not remain constant and can be
> reduced if greater definition of outflows is needed---above the weir
> crest, for instance. Also, note that the depth *h* is an intermedi-
> ate variable in the computations and is not used in the remainder of
> the procedure. Finally, observe the importance of accurate contours,
> normally derived from a survey, in developing the stage-vs.-volume
> relationship.
>
> Next, we develop a storage-indication curve for the pond. This is a
> plot of 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* vs. *Q* (where *Q* is total outflow). For
> instance, at *Q* = 50 cfs, *S* = 59,173 ft^3^ and

2*S* 2(59,173 ft^3^)

> Δ*t* + *Q* = (10 min)(60 s/min) + 50 cfs = 247 cfs.
>
> These values are tabulated in the preceding table, and the storage-
> indication curve is plotted in Figure E4--5(c). The curve is simply
> another way of presenting the hydraulic relationship between storage
> and outflow. The meaning is that if by another mechanism the quantity
> 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* can be determined, then the outflow *Q* can be
> determined from this relation- ship. Note that the storage-indication
> curve has nothing to do with the inflow hydrograph; the only link is
> that the value of Δ*t* used to develop the storage-indication curve

**KINEMATIC WAVE**

**ROUTING**

> The kinematic wave assumption is that inertial and pressure effects
> are unimportant and that the weight or gravity force of fluid is
> approximately balanced by the resistive forces of bed friction \[Eq.
> (4--30) and Table 4--1\]. Kinematic waves will not accelerate
> appreciably and can flow only in a downstream direction without any
> crest subsidence. Hence, kinematic wave methods cannot account for
> backwater. The flood wave will be observed as a uniform rise and fall
> in water surface over a relatively long period of time. Thus,
> kinematic waves represent the characteristic changes in discharge,
> velocity, and water surface elevation with time at any one location on
> an overland flow plane or along a stream channel. Kinematic waves are
> often classified as uniform, unsteady flows.
>
> The kinematic wave method of routing overland and river flows is
> included in the HEC-HMS program, as described in detail in Chapter 5.
> The following discussion and numerical solutions are based on the HMS
> program because of the wide acceptance and availability (Hydrologic
> Engineering
>
> Center, 2006). Kinematic wave routing is also an important aspect of
> the Storm Water Management Model (Huber and Dickinson, 1988), as
> described in Chapter 6, and the Vflo model described in Chapter 11.
>
> The concept incorporated into HEC-HMS uses various elements such as
> overland flow planes, collector channels, and main channels to route
> kine- matic waves (Fig. 4--9). These various elements are combined to
> describe basin and subbasin responses to storm events. Overland flow
> is handled

> After overland runoff is routed down the length of the overland flow

**HYDRAULIC RIVER**

**ROUTING**

> The application of the Saint Venant equations \[Eqs. (4--23) and
> (4--27)\] in flood routing involves solving them simultaneously down
> the length of a stream channel. An excellent review of methods is
> given by Price (1974), who compares four of the more important
> numerical methods for hydraulic flood routing with exact analytical
> solutions for the monoclinal wave (Sec- tion 4.5). Price found that
> the four-point implicit numerical scheme of Amein and Fang (1970) was
> the most efficient of the methods and is most accurate when Δ*x* Δ*t*
> is approximately equal to the speed of the monoclinal wave, the
> kinematic wave speed. In the numerical schemes, the stage was defined
> at the upstream boundary, and rating curve conditions were specified
> at the downstream boundary.
>
> The objective of the numerical flood routing method is to simulate the
> propagation of a flood downstream in a river, given a stage or
> discharge hydrograph at an upstream section. The preceding methods
> provide the most accurate solution available for predicting floods
> downstream in a large river or for considering effects of channel
> alteration or reservoir storage. Because the computational effort is
> relatively large for any numerical solu- tion, careful consideration
> should be given to selecting one of the available hydraulic methods
> vs. one of the simpler, approximate methods such as kine- matic wave
> or the Muskingum method.
>
> **Characteristic Methods**
>
> The early approaches to numerical flood routing were based on the
> charac- teristic form of the governing equations. This form basically
> replaces the par- tial differential equations with four ordinary
> differential equations, which are then solved numerically along the
> characteristic curves. Henderson (1966) and Overton and Meadows (1976)
> present details of the conversion. However, the characteristic method
> is cumbersome because of required interpolation over
>
> the variable grid mesh in space and time. The method involves
> integration along two sets of characteristic curves, and a network of
> variable points is located in the *xt*-plane by the intersection of
> the forward and backward char- acteristic curves. With the advent of
> the more efficient implicit methods described in the sections that
> follow, the characteristic method offers no addi- tional accuracy with
> relatively complex interpolation problems.
>
> **Explicit Methods**
>
> Explicit methods are primarily the outcome of the pioneering work of
> Stoker (1957) and Issacson et al. (1956). A network of nodes, as shown
> in Figure 4--13, is defined for solving the governing equations in *x*
> and *t*. The variables are known at points *L*, *M*, and *R.* The
> centered difference solution is used to solve Equations (4--23) and
> (4--27) for velocity *v*(*P*) and depth*y*(*P*) at point *P*. The
> initial condition and boundary conditions (upstream and downstream)
> must be known from inflow hydrographs and stage--outflow relations.
> The major disadvantage of the explicit approach is the requirement of
> using small time steps, known as the Courant condition, to avoid
> stability problems \[Δ*t* ... Δ*x c*, where *c* is defined in Eq.
> (4--34)\].
>
> **Implicit Methods**
>
> Implicit methods have received the most interest in recent years
> because they overcome the stability problems of explicit methods and
> allow fewer time steps for flood routing. The four-point implicit
> method of Amein and Fang (1970) has the feature of solving the
> nonlinear simultaneous finite- difference equations using the Newton
> iteration technique. In this method, a set of *N* equations with *N*
> unknowns results from writing the equations in space and time and
> incorporating upstream and downstream boundary con- ditions. The
> details of the iteration process are given in Amein and Fang (1970)
> with relevant boundary conditions. The method was applied to sev- eral
> actual flood predictions in North Carolina and was found to be
> accurate and more efficient than the explicit or characteristic
> methods. Computer

> in the explicit method.

> **Diffusion Model**
>
> The diffusion wave model (also called the noninertia model) is
> intermediate in complexity between the kinematic wave model and the
> full dynamic wave model and assumes that the inertia terms in Equation
> (4--27) are negligible compared with the pressure, friction, and

> 0*t* + *c* 0*x* = *D*~1~ 0*x*2 , (4--63)
>
> where *c* is wave celerity and *D*~1~ is a diffusion coefficient
> (defined in the next section). The effect of the diffusion term,
> compared with the kinematic wave, is to make *y* decrease in the view
> of an observer moving at velocity *c*. Thus, attenuation of the flood
> wave is included in the diffusion model, but not for the kinematic
> wave. Attenuation may be important in long rivers or for rivers with
> large floodplains.
>
> The kinematic model applies to shallow flow on steep slopes or to
> long- duration flood waves. The diffusion model applies to a wider
> range of condi- tions, and the full dynamic model applies to any
> condition.

> The Muskingum method presented in Section 4.2 is based on the
> continuity equation and the storage--discharge relation. Cunge (1969)
> extended the method into a finite-difference scheme called the
> Muskingum--Cunge method that takes the form

> during the falling stage, leading to a loop rating curve, as shown in
> Figure 4--14. If the hydrograph has multiple peaks, the curve can be
> very complex, as shown in Figure 4--14(a). A theoretical shape for a

> **Unsteady or Dynamic Models**
>
> Hydrologic routing techniques are not adequate for modeling unsteady
> flows subject to backwater or tidal effects and channels with very
> mild bottom slopes. Chapter 7 discusses the unsteady state version of
> HEC-RAS which uses UNET as the internal program for computations. The
> St. Venant equa- tions, as described earlier, are typically used to
> solve unsteady flow prob- lems. As a result of the development of
> computer hardware and software technology, simulation software became
> widely available to solve the full St. Venant equations in the 1980s
> and 1990s. In the United States, there are two widely used dynamic
> models using the St. Venant equations, FLDWAV and UNET. The FLDWAV
> model that evolved from its earlier versions DAM- BRK (1984) and
> DWOPER (1978) was developed by D. Fread and has been mainly applied to
> the national river forecast; while the UNET model was developed by
> Barkau and has been incorporated into the USACE Hydro- logic
> Engineering Center's River Analysis Systems (HEC-RAS) in order to
> simulate one-dimensional unsteady flow through a full network of open
> channels (Barkau, 1992; HEC, 2010).
>
> Discrete solution over a grid and iteration are the two major
> processes in the computational process in solving the St. Venant
> Equations. HEC-RAS uses an implicit finite-difference scheme in the
> stage of discretization to determine the new values of water level and
> discharge at a discrete point based on all discrete points and with at
> least two time steps solved simultane- ously. This implicit scheme is
> found more stable than other explicit schemes. Both HEC-RAS and DWOPER
> use the four-point numerical scheme. Solv- ing the implicit equations
> requires an iteration approach, which means that at a given time step,
> successive solutions of water level and discharge are obtained until
> the difference of the latest values and the values from the previous
> iteration is small enough. Thus, it is regarded to have converged on
> the correct value. For instance, HEC-RAS uses 0.02 ft and 20 as the
> default water-level convergence and the maximum number of iterations.
>
> The unsteady flow component in HEC-RAS was developed primarily for
> subcritical flow regime calculations. But with version (4.1) of
> HEC-RAS, the model is able to perform mixed flow regime (subcritical,
> super-critical, hydrau- lic jumps, and draw downs) calculations in the
> unsteady flow computation mod- ule. The hydraulic calculations for
> cross sections, bridges, culverts, and other hydraulic structures that
> were developed for the steady flow component were incorporated into
> the unsteady flow module. Additionally, the unsteady flow component is
> capable of handling dam break analysis, levee breaching and
> overtopping, pumping stations, navigation dam operations, and
> pressurized pipe systems. Further details of the unsteady flow
> component can be found in the manual provided with HEC-RAS (HEC,
> 2010).

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 4 covers hydrologic (storage) and hydraulic routing methods to
> predict flood movement for rivers and reservoirs. Hydrologic routing
> requires solution of the lumped continuity equation and a
> storage--outflow relation. The relation may be a function of both
> inflow and outflow for a river, but for a reservoir, storage is
> related only to outflow. Simple numerical methods are presented for
> solving the flood rout- ing equations through time.
>
> Hydraulic river routing is more complex than hydrologic routing in
> that both the one-dimensional continuity and the momentum equations
> must be solved. In many cases, the momentum equation may be simplified
> to Manning's equation; the procedure is called kinematic wave routing.
> Most practical kinematic wave solutions require numerical methods to
> compute actual hydrographs, such as those that are currently included
> in the HEC-HMS (HMS) Flood Hydrograph package or the Vflo model
> (Vieux, 2004).
>
> Full hydraulic (dynamic) routing requires solution of the Saint Venant
> equations, for which advanced numerical schemes must be employed to
> maintain mathematical stability and provide accurate solutions.
> Implicit finite-difference methods are the most commonly used
> techniques. One of the most accurate com- puter models for dynamic
> routing is DWOPER, which uses the four-point implicit method. DWOPER
> (as well as the newer NWS FLDWAV) has been extensively tested for
> floods on the Mississippi, Ohio, and Columbia Rivers with excellent
> results.
>
> The UNET model was developed by Barkau (1992) and has been incorpo-
> rated into the USACE HEC-RAS model in order to simulate
> one-dimensional unsteady flow through a full network of open channels
> (HEC, 2010). This model is currently widely used for applications to

1.  How does river routing differ from reservoir routing?

2.  Compare and contrast hydrologic and hydraulic routing methods.

3.  What are the assumptions made for Kinematic Wave Routing? As a
    result of these assumptions, what are the shortcomings of the
    method?

4.  How does the method in Problem 4.20 compare with the kinematic wave
    rout- ing method described in this chapter? What hydraulic
    conditions are neces- sary for kinematic wave assumptions to be
    valid for overland flow? What are advantages and disadvantages of
    using kinematic channel routing compared with solving the Saint
    Venant equations?

8.  Develop a Muskingum routing program in Excel, and repeat Problem
    4.7. Compare the results.

9.  Flood route the given input hydrograph through a linear reservoir
    (*S* = *KQ*), given *K* = 2.5 hr and Δ*t* = 1 hr. Solve one step
    beyond the peak outflow by developing a simple relation for
    computing outflow *Q*~2~, as a function of *Q*~1~, and inflows
    *I*~1~ and *I*~2~. Assume that storage and outflow are initially
    zero. Use the fact that *S* = *K*(*xI* + (1 - *x*)*Q*) and *I* - *Q*
    = Δ*S*\>Δ*t*. (*Hint:* Use the fact that the reservoir is linear to
    determine *x*).

10. A detention pond needs to be designed with a total capacity of 30
    ac-in. of stor- age. The inflow hydrograph for the pond is given in
    Figure P4--10. Assume that that pond is initially 50% full and
    outflow will cease when the pond is again 50% full. Graphically
    determine the peak outflow from the pond assuming a linear rise and
    fall in the outflow hydrograph. Draw the outflow hydrograph. At what
    time does outflow cease? (*Hint:* The outflow hydrograph will peak
    at the intersection of the inflow and the outflow hydrographs. Also,
    make use of the fact that the available volume for storage is equal
    to the area between the two triangular hydrographs and must be equal
    to 50% of the storage.)

13. Given the reservoir with a storage-discharge relationship governed
    by the equation

*S* = *KQ*^3\>2^,

> route the inflow hydrograph for Problem 4.5 using storage routing
> techniques and a value of *K* = 1.31 for *Q* in m^3^/s and *S* in
> m^3^/s-hr. Discuss the differences in the outflow hydrograph for this
> reservoir and for the reservoir of Problem 4.12. Use Δ*t* = 1 hr.

14. A storm event occurred on Falls Creek Watershed that produced a
    rainfall pat- tern of 5 cm/hr for the first 10 min, 10 cm/hr in the
    second 10 min, and 5 cm/hr in the next 10 min. The watershed is
    divided into three subbasins (see Fig. P4--14), with the unit
    hydrographs given in the following table. Subbasins *A* and *B* had
    a loss rate of 2.5 cm/hr for the first 10 min and 1.0 cm/hr
    thereafter. Subbasin *C* had a loss rate of 1.0 cm/hr for the first
    10 min and 0 cm/hr thereafter. Using a simple lag routing method
    (time shift the hydrograph by *K*), determine the storm hydrograph
    at point 2. Assume a lag time *K* of 40 min.

20. Develop a new flood routing method for rectangular cross sections
    based on the Muskingum and storage indication techniques. Instead of
    using the Musk- ingum storage equation *S* = *f* (*K*, *x*, *I*,
    *Q*), use Manning's equation in the form where *a* and *m* are
    constants. Assume prismatic channel conditions at each time step,
    and derive the necessary equation for flood routing in a given rect-
    angular channel with length *L*, inflows *I*~1~ and *I*~2~, channel
    width *B*, and outflows *Q*~1~ and *Q*~2~. Manning's equation takes
    the form

> *Q* = *ay^m^*.

21. Equation (4--47) and Manning's equation (Eq. 4--48) can be combined
    to develop a second form of the kinematic wave equation \[Eq.
    (4--56)\], but in terms of *Q*.

    a.  Prove that the equation

> [0*Q*]{.underline} + *a*b*Q*^b-1^ [0*Q*]{.underline} = *q*
>
> 0*x* 0*t*

>
> Advances in computer hardware and software since the 1970s combined
> with larger and more extensive hydrologic data-monitoring efforts
> allowed for the development and application of a number of models in
> hydrology. These computer models can be used for a variety of purposes
> in simulating hydro- logic response under a number of assumptions
> within a watershed area. Such models incorporate various equations to
> describe hydrologic transport pro- cesses and storages and to account
> for water balances in space and time. Complex rainfall patterns and
> heterogeneous basins can be simulated with relative ease if watershed
> and hydrologic data are sufficient, and various design and control
> schemes can be tested with hydrologic models. HEC models will be
> highlighted in this chapter with detailed examples, and others are
> presented in Chapters 6, 9, and 11.
>
> Earlier chapters have presented a number of computational methods
> routinely used to convert rainfall into a storm hydrograph at the
> basin outlet. The rainfall--runoff process was presented in detail in
> Chapters 1 and 2, where we showed how input rainfall is distributed
> into various components of evap- oration, infiltration, detention or
> depression storage, overland flow, and
>
> **Table 5--1** Factors Affecting the Hydrograph

> eventually streamflow. The concept of the unit hydrograph was
> demonstrated converting rainfall over a watershed into associated
> runoff. Chapter 3 pre- sented various statistical methods for treating
> return frequency events such as rainfall or streamflow hydrologic
> series. Chapter 4 presented various flood routing methods within
> channels and rivers to move hydrographs from one point to another.
> Hydrologic models allow for hydrologic prediction in space and time
> through the use of well-known numerical methods.
>
> The actual shape and timing of the response hydrograph for a given
> watershed have been shown to be a function of many physiographic, land
> use, and meteorological variables, which are listed in Table 5--1.
> Rainfall intensity and duration are the major driving forces of the
> rainfall--runoff process, followed by watershed characteristics that
> translate the rainfall input into an output hydrograph at the outlet
> of the basin. Size, slope, shape, soils, and storage capacity are all
> important parameters in watershed geo- morphology. Land use and land
> cover parameters can significantly alter the natural hydrologic
> response through increases in impervious cover, altered slopes, and
> improved drainage channel networks.
>
> Major research programs by Harvard University, Stanford University,
> and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the 1960s were pioneering
> efforts to use early versions of digital computers to simulate
> watershed behavior on a continuous basis. The Stanford Watershed Model
> (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), which later evolved into HSPF
> (Hydrologic Simulation Program---FORTRAN) (Johanson et al., 1980; US
> EPA, 2007), was the first available major watershed model. Continuous
> models such as HSPF are based on long-term water-balance equations and
> thus account directly for effects of antecedent conditions.
>
> From these early efforts, a range of modeling approaches including
> event models was developed and applied during the 1970s for urban
> storm- water, floodplain hydrology, agricultural drainage, reservoir
> design, and river basin management. Much of the model development was
> driven by the interest in stream and lake water quality in urban
> runoff that surged during the 1970s.
>
> Single event models are designed to simulate rainfall--runoff from
> single storm events. Models such as the original HEC-1 Flood
> Hydrograph Package (HEC, 1981), the revised HEC-HMS (HEC, 1998, 2006,
> 2010) are widely used for floodplain analysis. The more sophisticated
> model was the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), developed in 1971
> for EPA to address in detail the quantity and quality variations in
> urban runoff (Metcalf et al., 1971). The SWMM model can be used for
> storm event or continuous simulation and has been through a number of
> updates and improvements over the years (Huber and Dickinson, 1988;
> SWMM5, 2005; Rossman, 2010). This model is considered one of the most
> comprehensive for simulating urban runoff dynamics, drainage design,
> hydraulic analysis, and nonpoint source water quality. With more
> demands from end users, the SWMM model was enhanced into a commercial
> modeling package---XP-SWMM (eXPert Stormwater and Wastewater
> Management Model) by XP Software (2010). Besides all the capabilities
> of SWMM, the XP-SWMM model has a better graphical user interface and
> the ability of linking the 1-D flow simulation to a 2-D overland flow
> model to generate floodplain maps.
>
> As an important addition to the water resources modeling field, the
> Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) Water and Environment, Inc., provides
> a whole suite of hydrologic and hydraulic modeling tools (MIKE URBAN,
> MIKE FLOOD, etc.) to address engineering problems of rainfall-runoff,
> pipe flows, overland flows, water quality, and sediment transport. For
> instance, the MIKE URBAN model enables users to simulate water,
> wastewater, and storm water in one integrated GIS-based framework that
> is powered by ESRI's ArcObjects components (DHI, 2011). The basic
> module of MIKE URBAN - Model Manager incorporates the U.S. EPA's fully
> dynamic storm water and waste water network modeling package (SWMM 5)
> and the stan- dard distribution network model (EPANET) to simulate
> hydraulics and water quality. In addition, the 2-D flow simulation
> module provides an easy and flexible tool for computing and
> visualizing the flows above and below ground in one fully integrated
> dynamic simulation.
>
> Hydrologic simulation models can be classified according to a wide
> range of characteristics, as shown in Table 5--2. For watershed
> analysis, the major categories of interest include lumped parameter
> vs. distributed parameter, event vs. continuous, and stochastic vs.
> deterministic. Lumped

> Distributed parameter models attempt to describe physical processes

> detail in Chapters 10 and 11 (i.e., Vflo) along with radar rainfall
> input and digital elevation methods for setting up grids to compute
> overland flow and channel flow.

> flood frequency analysis. Hydrologic synthesis allows hydrologists to
> extend short historical records, such as streamflow, to longer
> sequences based on statistical methods. Syn- thetic sequences either
> preserve the statistical character of the historical record or follow
> a prescribed probability distribution, such as a lognormal or log
> Pearson type 3 (Section 3.5). Mass curve analysis assumes that his-
> torical records will repeat exactly. Random generations assume that
> succes- sive flows are independent and distributed according to a
> known probability distribution. Details on stochastic models can be
> found in Bras and Rodri- guez--Iturbe (1984), Stedinger et al. (1993),
> and Hirsch et al. (1993).

> A major advantage of simulation models is the insight gained by
> gather- ing and organizing data required as input to the mathematical
> algorithms that comprise the overall model system. This exercise can
> often guide the collection of additional data or direct the
> improvement of mathematical formulations to better represent watershed
> behavior. Another advantage is that many alterna- tive schemes for
> water supply systems, for urban development, or flood con- trol
> options can be quickly tested and compared with simulation models.
>
> The major limitation of simulation models is the inability to properly
> calibrate and verify applications in which input data are lacking.
> Current practice assumes that the simplest model that will
> satisfactorily describe the
>
> system for the given input data should be used. Model accuracy is
> largely determined by available input data and observed input and

> rainfall, hydrologic, and topographic datasets are now available for
> many areas, and model accu- racy has increased accordingly.
>
> Despite their limitations, simulation models still provide the most
> logical and scientifically advanced approach to understanding the
> hydrologic behavior of complex watershed and water resources systems.
> The availabil- ity of digital elevation datasets and radar rainfall
> data has opened a new era in the science of hydrology and has led to

> (see Chapters 6, 9, 10, and 11). Sev- eral excellent reviews of models
> in hydrology have been published, including Maidment (1993), DeVries
> and Hromadka (1993), Hoggan (1997), James and James (1998a), and

> **STEPS IN WATERSHED MODELING**
>
> With so many hydrologic models available to the hydrologist or civil
> engi- neer, very little new model development is currently being
> supported. Rather, one must select one of the available simulation
> models based on characteristics of the system to be studied, the
> objectives to be met, and the available budget for data collection and
> analysis. Once the model is selected, the steps involved in watershed
> simulation analysis generally follow the sequence of Table 5--3.
>
> **Table 5--3** Steps in Watershed Modeling
>
> The selection of a model is a very difficult and important decision,
> since the success of the analysis hinges on accuracy of the results.
> Table 5--2 should be considered along with characteristics of the
> watershed, study objectives, and so on to develop a modeling plan. In
> general, unless digital watershed data are extensive in space and
> time, the usual approach to water- shed analysis is to use a
> deterministic event model with lumped parameter concepts for
> developing hydrographs and flood routing. The HEC-HMS (2006, 2010) is
> one of the most widely used models for typical watershed analysis to
> convert rainfall to runoff and streamflow. An Applications Guide was
> written in 2008 by Ford et al. to illustrate applications of HEC-HMS
> to studies on urban floods, flood frequency, flood loss reduction,
> flood warning, reservoir design, and environmental issues.
>
> If a watershed has extensive data available on rainfall, infiltration,
> baseflow, streamflow, and soils and land use, then HSPF from U.S. EPA
> BASINS (2007) can be applied for calculating continuous long-term
> water balances and outflow hydrographs. For the case of a well-defined
> urban drainage network, a distributed event model such as SWMM (Huber
> and Dickinson, 1988; James and 1998b; SWMM5, 2005; Rossman, 2010) can
> be applied to define hydrologic response for components throughout the
> sys- tem. Urban stormwater models are discussed in more detail in
> Section 5.3 and Chapter 6. Another GIS-based distributed model, Vflo,
> is presented in Chapter 11.
>
> Step 5 in Table 5--3, model calibration and verification, is important
> in fitting the model parameters and producing accurate and reliable
> results in steps 6 and 7. Model calibration involves selecting a
> measured set of input data (rainfall, channel routing, land use, and
> so on) and measured output hydrographs for model application. The
> controlling parameters in the model are adjusted until a "best fit" is
> obtained for this set of data. The model should then be "verified" by
> simulating a second or third event (i.e., different rainfall) and
> keeping all other parameters unchanged to produce a com- parison of
> predicted and measured hydrographs. A detailed example of the HEC-HMS
> model is described in Section 5.6, where an actual case study is
> highlighted to indicate difficulties and complexities that are often
> encoun- tered in watershed analyses.
>
> A selected number of the most popular event, continuous, and urban
> runoff models for hydrologic simulation are listed in Table 5--4.
> Universities or federal agencies supported the development of most of
> these models. Some of the models are very well documented and, as a
> result, have seen wide application to watersheds, especially in the
> United States. Others have been applied only to specific areas in the
> country. Extreme care and judgment must be exercised in applying any
> one of these models to areas where data exist to define UH and routing
> parameters.

> **DESCRIPTION OF MAJOR HYDROLOGIC MODELS**
>
> Several of the surface water models in Table 5--4 will be briefly
> reviewed below.
>
> The **HSPF** was the commercial successor to SWM-IV and was modi- fied
> to include water quality considerations, kinematic wave routing, and
> variable time steps. The current version is HSPF, which is a
> redesigned modular version that performs simulations of a variety of
> hydrologic and water quality processes on or under the land surface,
> in channels, and in reservoirs (Johanson et al., 1980). The HSPF model
> simulates both water- shed hydrology and water quality. It allows an
> integrated simulation of land and soil contaminant runoff processes
> with in-stream hydraulic and sediment-chemical interactions. The
> program provides a time history of runoff rate, sediment load, and
> nutrient and pesticide concentration, along with a time history of
> water quality and quantity at specific points in a watershed. HSPF
> computes a continuous hydrograph of streamflow at the basin outlet.
> Input is a continuous record of rainfall and evaporation data.
> Infiltration is divided into surface runoff and interflow, and deeper
> perco- lation to the ground water. Three soil moisture zones are
> included in the model. Total streamflow is a combination of overland
> flow, interflow, and ground water flow.
>
> One of the most useful modules in HSPF is the nonpoint-source model
> (NPS), which provides for continuous simulation of nonpoint pol-
> lutants from urban and undeveloped land surfaces. It is available as a
> separate model from EPA and has been extensively tested with HSP by
> the Northern Virginia Planning Commission. HSPF is the model of choice
> for evaluation of continuous runoff and nonpoint-source loads (EPA-
> BASINS, 2007). Originally introduced in 1996 with subsequent releases
> in 2001 and 2007, BASINS is a multipurpose environmental analysis
> system designed for use by regional, state, and local agencies in
> performing water- shed and water-quality-based studies. This system
> makes it possible to quickly assess large amounts of point-source and
> nonpoint-source data in

> HEC-HMS is a general flood hydrograph package with the following
> capabilities:

1.  Simulation of watershed runoff and streamflow from historical or
    > design rainfall

2.  Determination of flood flows at various locations for use in flood-
    > plain studies

3.  Evaluation of land use or topographic changes in a watershed area

4.  Simulation of flood control measures, such as reservoir storage and
    > channel options

5.  Computation of damage frequency curves and expected annual dam- ages
    > for various locations and multiple flood control plans

> **Watershed Delineation and Organization**
>
> HEC-HMS uses parameters averaged in space and time to simulate the
> runoff process. The size of subbasins, routing reaches, or computation
> interval is selected based on the basin physiography, available
> rainfall data, available streamflow data, and required accuracy. A
> watershed is subdi- vided into small and relatively homogeneous
> subbasins according to drain- age divides based on mapped or digital
> topography, as shown in Figure 5--1. The size of a subbasin should
> generally be in the range of 1--10 mi^2^ because of limitations of UH
> theory, especially in urban areas. Routing reaches are identified, and
> the overall order of the runoff computation is defined (from upstream
> to downstream) for input to HEC. Routing reaches should be long enough
> so that a flood wave will not travel faster than the computation time
> step. Otherwise, numerical errors in flood calculations will occur.
> Simple routing methods described in Sections 4.1 to 4.3 are contained
> in HEC-HMS.
>
> **Precipitation**
>
> Precipitation *P* is computed for each subbasin in Figure 5--1 using
> his- torical data or synthetic design storms. The model allows for (1)
> incre- mental *P* (depth of *P* for each time interval) for each
> subbasin, (2) total cumulative *P* and a time distribution, or (3)
> historical gage data together with areal weighting (Thiessen)
> coefficients for each subbasin. Standard design storms can be used in
> the form of (1) depth vs. duration data,
>
> \(2\) probable maximum precipitation, or (3) standard project
> precipita- tion. The precipitation data must be input at a constant
> time interval, but this interval may be different from the
> computational time interval in the model. Precipitation inputs are
> described for HEC-HMS in Section 5.5, and a detailed example is
> contained in Section 5.6 for a complex water- shed. Figure 5--2 shows
> a typical basin model for the HEC-HMS model indicating various
> subareas and river reaches that connect the subareas together.
>
> HEC-HMS is capable of simulating snowfall and snowmelt. Up to 10
> elevation zones of equal increments may be specified in each subbasin.
> Usually, an elevation increment of 1000 ft is used, but any increment
> may be specified as long as the air-temperature lapse rate corresponds
> to the change in elevation within the zone. Snowmelt occurs when the
> tem- perature is equal to or greater than the melt temperature and is
> calcu- lated by either the degree-day method or an energy budget
> method (see Section 2.9). For more detail on snowfall and snowmelt
> calculations, see the HEC user's manual (HEC, 2010) and *Runoff from
> Snowmelt* (U.S. ACOE, 1960). Dingman (2002) covers snowmelt in more
> detail with examples.

> **Loss Rate Analysis**
>
> HEC contains several methods for computing the loss of precipitation
> to interception and infiltration, as shown in Table 5--5. The simplest
> is the initial and constant loss rate function, in which the initial
> loss volume is satisfied before the constant loss rate begins. The
> remaining constant loss is identical to the f index method for
> infiltration (see Section 2.7) and is often used in design storm
> analysis or where data are insufficient to allow calculation with more
> sophisticated methods.
>
> **Table 5--5** HEC-HMS Loss Methods
>
> The SCS method employs the SCS curve number, CN, which is directly
> related to land use and hydrologic soil properties of a watershed. The
> SCS approach relates accumulated rainfall excess or runoff to accu-
> mulated rainfall with CN (see Section 2.5). It is popular because of
> its application to ungaged areas and its large empirical database. The
> method requires input of CN, initial abstraction, and percent
> imperviousness (McCuen, 2005).
>
> The Green and Ampt method was added to HEC in 1990 and prob- ably is
> one of the best estimates for infiltration, since the parameters are
> all measurable and directly related to soil types in a watershed.
> Version 3.5 of HMS uses four different parameters to apply the method;
> it is necessary to measure or estimate hydraulic conductivity,
> capillary suction at the wetting front, initial moisture content, and
> saturated moisture content (see Section

8.  for Green and Ampt and Table 2--4 for data). These parameters can be
    estimated effectively using physical soil characteristics, such as
    soil texture class and major soil horizon classification.
    Calculation of these parameters assumes that the soil is a
    homogeneous medium with uniform initial mois- ture content. The
    Green and Ampt method has received significant atten- tion in recent
    years with the release of HEC-HMS. For example, the TSARP program
    instituted in Houston, TX, after T.S. Allison flooding uti- lized
    the Green and Ampt methods in modeling 22 different watersheds (see
    Appendix E).

> **Subbasin Runoff Calculation**

> Several methods for surface runoff or transform computations in HEC
> are available in the model and can be selected by the user. These are
> presented in Table 5--6 and include the UH methods of Clark *TC & R*
> (1945), Snyder (1938), and the Soil Conservation Service (SCS, 1984,
> 1986). Known UHs

> can also be directly input. The kinematic wave overland flow
> computation was added to HEC in 1981 and allows more accurate
> representation of urbanized areas for UH calculations (HEC, 1981).
> Kinematic wave methods are described in more detail in Section 4.6. A
> similar setup for conversion of rainfall to runoff exists for HEC-HMS
> (Section 5.5).
>
> Clark's method is based on the time--area curve method described in
> Chapter 2. The time--area histogram, determined from isochrones of the
> watershed, or contours from points at which water arrives at the same
> time, is convoluted with a unit design storm hyetograph to yield the
> hydro- graph, which is then routed through linear reservoir storage to
> allow for peak attenuation. The Clark-method parameters are the time
> of concen- tration and the storage coefficient *R*, defined in Section
> 2.5. Hoggan (1997) provides more details on the Clark method, and
> Table 5--10 presents empirical *TC* and *R* equations derived for
> Houston, TX (within Harris County).
>
> The HEC model uses a synthetic time--area curve derived from a gen-
> eralized basin shape, and the equations are applicable to most basins:

*AI* = 1.414*T*^1.5^, 0 ... *T* 6 0.5, (5--1)

1 - *AI* = 1.414(1 - *T*)^1.5^, 0.5 6 *T* 6 1. (5--2)

> where *AI* is the cumulative area as a fraction of subbasin area and
> *T* is fraction of time of concentration, *T~c~*. Specific time--area
> curves can also be input to HEC model if they can be computed from
> some other GIS-type method.
>
> The computed hydrograph based on a time--area method is routed through
> a linear reservoir (Section 4.3) to produce the final UH. A family of
> 2-hr UHs generated by HEC is shown in Figure 5--3 for a 4.3-mi^2^
> basin with *TC* = 0.45 hr. Note the wide range of hydrograph shapes
> that can be produced by the two-parameter UH. An SCS UH is shown for
> comparison. The larger the value of *R* (*TC* + *R*), the flatter the
> UH response, more typical of natural watersheds with flat slopes.
> Thus, the smaller ratios cor- respond to more urbanized watersheds.
> The steepest hydrograph could also represent a basin with steep slopes

Time (hr)

> Snyder's method (Section 2.3) provides time to peak *t~p~* and peaking
> coefficient *C~p~*, which are insufficient to produce the curved shape
> of the hydrograph. Clark's method is therefore used to help smooth and
> define the shape of the hydrograph corresponding to Snyder's
> coefficients within the HEC model. The direct runoff ordinates are
> then calculated by convo- lution of the UH with the net precipitation
> for the subbasin.
>
> The kinematic wave process, described in more detail in Section 4.6,
> represents a nonlinear runoff response compared with linear UH
> methods. The kinematic wave method relies on parameters that are
> generally measur- able from a basin, such as slope, land use, lengths,
> channel shape, roughness, and area. Overland flow, collector, and main
> channel elements are used to represent the characteristics of a
> drainage basin (Fig. 4--9). In the method, the main equations are
> Manning's equation of flow and continuity \[Eqs. (4--47) and
> (4--48)\]. These are solved numerically to produce overland flow as a
> function of time and space. The same equations are solved for channel
> elements (Fig. 4--9). The kinematic wave (KW) method is more
> applicable to the analysis of urban basins, since KW theory does not
> provide for the attenuation of flood waves. The area of the subbasin
> is required along with *L*, *S*, *n*, shape, and size, and any
> upstream hydrograph to be routed in the reach. KW routing is also
> available in the main channel. Chapter 11 presents a section on
> distributed modeling with VFLO using kinematic wave methods (Vieux,
> 2004).
>
> **Baseflow Calculation**
>
> HEC-HMS simulates baseflow of a flood hydrograph with three
> parameters:
>
> \(1\) *Q*~0~, flow in channel prior to start of rising limb; (2) ratio
> of recession flows at t=1 (RTIOR), exponential decay rate; and (3)
> *Q~R~*, point on falling
>
> **Figure 5--4** Components of streamflow hydrograph.

*Q*0

>
> limb called the recession threshold (Fig. 5--4). The above parameters
> can be obtained through a semilog plot of observed *Q* vs. time. The
> decay rate RTIOR is equal to the slope of the line, and *Q~R~ Q*~peak~
> is usually in the range of 0.05 to 0.15.
>
> Equation (5--3) defines the parameters that are used in the model, in
> which the recession flow threshold *Q~R~* and the decay constant RTIOR
> must be specified by the user. Figure 5--4 defines the relation
> between the stream- flow hydrograph and user-defined parameters.
> Equation (5--3) computes recession flow *Q* as

where

> *Q* = *Q*~0~(RTIOR)^-*n*Δ*t*^, (5--3)
>
> *Q*~0~ = starting baseflow prior to the rising limb,
>
> *Q* = baseflow rate at end of *n*Δ*t*,
>
> RTIOR = ratio of recession flows at *t* = 1 hr increment apart.
>
> Many applications of HEC are for major urban flood events, where base-
> flow is a relatively small percentage of the total hydrograph flow. Of
> course, baseflow can be entered as a constant value or as zero.
> Several possibilities exist for computing baseflow in HEC-HMS (Section
> 5.5).
>
> **Flood Routing**
>
> Flood routing involves analyzing the movement of a flood wave as it
> travels from reach to reach through a stream or river. Table 5--7
> lists the major methods of flood routing that are available in HEC-HMS
> (see Chapter 4), where both storage-indication reservoir and river
> routing methods were cov- ered. The Muskingum method requires a *K*
> and *x*, where *K* can be obtained from analyses shown in Section 4.2
> or using the reach length divided by the wave velocity determined from
> Equation (4--38). *dQ dy* can be obtained
>
> **Table 5--7** Flood Routing in HEC-HMS
>
> from the slope of the rating curve at a typical discharge value to be
> routed. To avoid numerical instability, note that for the Muskingum
> method, 2*Kx* 6 Δ*t* ... *K* and number of subreaches = *K* Δ*t*,
> where *K* = travel time and Δ*t* = time interval.
>
> The Modified Puls method was briefly presented in Section 4.3 for a
> reservoir but can also be applied for rivers by developing a
> storage--dis- charge *S-Q* relation. One of several methods can be
> used: (1) steady-flow profile computation, (2) observed profiles, (3)
> normal depth profiles,

(4) storage from inflow and outflow hydrographs, and (5) optimization
    tech- niques. These are described in more detail in Hoggan (1997)
    and will not be repeated here. For method 1, several water surface
    profiles are generated: *WS*~1~ to *WS*~5~, corresponding to
    discharges, and *Q*~1~ to *Q*~5~, using the HEC-RAS program (Chapter
    7). The storage volumes are computed from cross-sectional areas of
    the channel and their lengths for each *WS~i~*. An *S-Q* curve
    (rating curve) is determined (Fig. 5--5). The number of routing
    steps to be used for a river reach is NSTEPs, equal to *K* Δ*t*.
    This is a numerical parameter related to flood wave speed vs. the
    computational time step so that numeri- cal stability is maintained.
    The greater the storage in a reach per unit of flow, the greater the
    attenuation of the flood wave as it is routed through (see Section
    5.6 for detailed example).

> The kinematic wave channel routing method does not allow flood peak
> attenuation, which is a problem where the floodplain is extensive.
> Thus, KW can overestimate flows compared to other methods. But it has
> the advantage of allowing for laterally distributed inflow along the
> main channel (HEC, 1990). Manning's equation forms the basis for the
> kinematic wave method, as described in detail in Section 4.6. All of
> the above flood routing methods exist for HEC-HMS and any one of them
> can be selected in the flood routing setup options. Vflo in Chapter 11
> is a good example where KW overland flow combined with storage routing
> in channels can provide accurate results for most watersheds.

> improved and upgraded over the years. This section contains a brief
> description of the back- ground, capabilities, and usage of the
> program; specific information is given on the selection and
> application of the various methods offered. A detailed applications
> manual is available from HEC (Ford et al., 2008). Example 5--1 gives
> the user a hands-on introduction to HEC-HMS, and Section 5.6 con-
> tains a case study of a typical watershed area that demonstrates the
> applica- tion of the model in detail. The beginning student is advised
> to refer to the most recent user manuals for the actual model setup,
> tutorials, and applica- tions. Several datasets and examples are
> provided in Appendix E in the text and on the textbook website.
>
> In HEC-HMS, a project consists of three separate parts: the basin
> model, the meteorologic model, and the control specifications. A back-
> ground map containing subwatershed boundaries and streams can be
> entered from a GIS mapfile as a visual reference, but it is not used
> for any calcula- tions. Mapfiles can be used as a background by
> selecting "background maps" under the View file menu and entering the
> name of the existing mapfile. The

> three model sections are accessed by the main screen, within the
> Watershed Explorer (WE) screen, which is the top window on the left
> side panel shown in Figure 5--6(a). This screen links to all the data
> and tools through the menus for the various main components. The user
> can select the models in the Watershed Explorer, and edit their
> components in the bottom window on the left side panel.
>
> **The Basin Model**
>
> The basin model contains the basin and routing parameters of the model
> as well as connectivity data for the basin. The GUI uses a simple
> click-and-drag method to place subbasins, reaches, reservoirs,
> junctions, diversions, sources, and sinks together to form the
> watershed. Each element can be given a name and description, and the
> user may select the method of calculation to be used by the model. The
> basin model is merely a representation of the actual watershed, and
> the visual location and sizes of each element do not matter as long as
> the numerical data and connectivity are correct. HEC-HMS then connects
> some objects placed at either end of routing reaches. Multiple ele-
> ments can connect downstream to one element, but one element cannot
> have multiple downstream connections. The user must be careful to
> connect
>
> objects in the correct direction of flow, which can be checked by
> selecting the option to show flow directions from the toolbar. A
> series of icons are used to represent the various elements within the
> model such as subbasin, routing reach, junction, reservoir, or outlet
> and are arranged in a horizontal line beneath the main menu. The icon
> representations for subbasins and junctions can be identified in basin
> model in Figure 5--6(a).
>
> **Subbasins** represent the physical areas within the basin and
> produce a discharge hydrograph at the outlet of their respective
> areas. The hydrograph produced is calculated from precipitation data
> minus the losses. The result- ing precipitation excess is transformed
> using a UH methodology to compute runoff at the outlet, which is then
> added to baseflow. Each component can be calculated using several
> methods. The area, loss rate, runoff, and baseflow inputs for each
> subbasin are entered into the basin model for each one using the
> Watershed Explorer.
>
> **Loss rates** can be simulated by one of several methods. For event
> mod- eling, techniques include initial and constant, SCS curve number,
> gridded SCS curve number, and Green and Ampt methods. The one-layer
> deficit and constant model can be used for simple continuous modeling.
> For modeling of complex infiltration and evapotranspiration
> environments, the five-layer soil moisture accounting model can be
> used. The method is changed in a simple menu-driven window, and the
> input data are entered on the "Loss" tab in the editor (Fig. 5--6(a)).
>
> **Transform methods**, which convert rainfall excess into surface
> runoff, can also be simulated using a variety of tools. HEC-HMS
> includes the pop- ular Clark TC & R and SCS UH techniques, as well as
> the Snyder Method or user specified UH. Spatially distributed runoff
> can be computed with the quasi-distributed linear transform of
> cell-based precipitation and infiltration. The Modified Clark method
> (ModClark) is a linear quasi-distributed UH method that can be used
> with gridded precipitation data. If the ModClark transform with
> gridded rainfall is used, a file that contains characteristics of
> subbasin grid cells is required. HEC-HMS can handle grid cell
> depiction of the watershed for distributed runoff computations. The
> kinematic wave method with multiple planes and channels is also
> included (see Chapter 4 for detail). Input data are entered in a
> simple menu-driven window.
>
> **Baseflow** takes into account normal flow through a channel or the
> effects of ground water. HEC-HMS offers two methods for baseflow
> calcu- lation: recession and constant monthly. The recession method is
> an expo- nential decay function of a defined starting baseflow. For
> the constant monthly method, the user simply enters a constant
> baseflow value for each month. No baseflow is also an option, and in
> simple hydrologic models over short time periods or highly urbanized
> basins with channels, baseflow can usually be neglected.
>
> **Flood routing** in HEC-HMS offers a number of options for the
> reaches and routing of flood hydrographs. The Muskingum method can be
> used for general routing; routing with no attenuation can be modeled
> with the lag
>
> method. The most popular and accurate is the Modified Puls method,
> which can be used to model a reach with a user-specified
> storage--outflow relation- ship. The S-Q relationship is derived from
> a hydraulics model such as HEC- RAS (Chapter 7).
>
> Channels with trapezoidal, rectangular, triangular, or circular cross
> sections can be modeled with Modified Puls, the kinematic wave or
> Musk- ingum--Cunge method (see Chapter 4). Channels with overbank
> areas can be modeled with the Muskingum--Cunge eight-point method,
> which takes coordinates at eight points in a cross section of the
> channel. The addition of options for subbasins and reaches allows
> different users to run HMS using the methods most appropriate to their
> watersheds. Input data are entered in a simple menu-driven window
> within Watershed Explorer. Homework problems in this chapter expand
> upon this further.
>
> **Reservoirs** store the inflow from upstream elements and produces an
> outflow hydrograph based on a monotonically increasing
> storage--outflow relationship. A reservoir can be entered with one of
> three possible types of relationships: storage vs. outflow, elevation
> vs. storage vs. outflow, or eleva- tion vs. area vs. outflow. The
> outflow structure must be well understood in order to develop an
> accurate storage--discharge relation. The inflow entering the
> reservoir must be contained with the minimum and maximum values of the
> data entered. The user must also select an initial condition of
> storage, elevation, outflow, or select inflow equal to outflow. The
> model assumes that elements have a level pool, such as ponds, lakes,
> or reservoirs. The effect of adding a detention pond to a basin can be
> modeled by using a reservoir. The input window for a reservoir is used
> to relate storage to outflow. A reservoir icon is used to represent
> storage at any point in the watershed and is then connected downstream
> to a junction.
>
> **Sources** are elements that represent a discharge into the basin as
> an observed hydrograph or a hydrograph generated by a previous
> simulation. They often are used to represent inflow from reservoirs,
> unmodeled head- water regions, or a watershed outside the region. This
> may be entered as gage data or a constant discharge. **Sinks** are
> elements that have an inflow and no outflow. The only inputs are the
> name and description of the sink. It may represent the lowest point of
> the drainage area or the outlet.
>
> **Diversions** for hydrologic models use a simple table relating
> inflow to diverted flow and routed flow. These relationships can be
> determined using geometric calculations and hydraulic models.
> Diversions will have two "downstream" connections, one being the
> routed path and the other the diverted path. The user specifies the
> diverted flow through the use of a table (inflow-diversion), and
> whatever flow is not diverted will travel the main path. If the
> "connected" option is selected, then the diverted flow will return to
> the watershed at the downstream location.
>
> Figure 5--6(a) shows a typical basin model with a mapfile in the back-
> ground. In very complicated watersheds where icons are often too
> crowded to display all labels, the user can identify objects by
> clicking on the buttons
>
> in the toolbar of the basin model. The selected item will be
> highlighted gray in the basin model. The toolbar also contains a
> magnifying button to zoom into a selected area, and the user can zoom
> out of an area by going to "Zoom Out" under View in menu the main
> menu. Objects can only be selected using the arrow tool.
>
> **The Meteorologic Model**
>
> The meteorologic model contains the precipitation data, either
> historical or hypothetical, for the HEC-HMS model. The model contains
> a number of options for modeling precipitation and can also account
> for evapotranspira- tion. Examples of historical precipitation inputs
> include hyetographs, gage weighting, and inverse-distance gage
> weighting (Fig. 5--6(b)). The program can handle an unlimited number
> of recording and nonrecording gages, and gage data can be entered
> manually, imported from an existing DSS file, or based on an Excel
> file, as described later. In addition, HEC-HMS has the capability to
> model gridded rainfall, such as NEXRAD-estimated radar rainfall
> (Chapters 11 and 12). Hypothetical precipitation data can be used for
> design storms based on frequency storm analysis and standard project
> storm (SPS) models. Figure 5--6(c) presents an example of how the
> 100-year frequency storm for Houston, TX, would be inputed into the
> model. Note that by clicking on the meteorological model the user can
> select the type of storm (Fig. 5--6(b)), and by clicking on the type
> of storm directly beneath the meteorological model the user can edit
> the specifications for that storm (Fig. 5--6(c)).

> each independent modeling run. A series of runs can be easily
> organized using this option with several different scenarios. HEC-HMS
> can also handle continuous hydrograph simulation over long periods. It
> is standard to run the model several days past the end of the storm to
> ensure that the falling limb of the computed hydrograph is completely
> captured.
>
> **Data Handling**
>
> A major improvement for HEC-HMS is the use of the Data Storage System,
> or HEC-DSS, used to manage time-series and tabular data. The system
> was the result of a need in hydrologic engineering to store a variety
> of types of data in a standardized format. Previously, data formatted
> for one program would need to be entered into another format for a
> different program by hand by each user. Each program would then use
> separate functions to ana- lyze and graph the data. The HEC-DSS
> software is the result of an effort to make hydrologic data management
> more efficient and allow for the HEC family of programs to use the
> same database.
>
> HEC-HMS stores all its output in a DSS file and can store much of its
> tabular or time-series input data in one or more DSS files. For
> example, reservoir storage--outflow relationships as well as
> precipitation and observed flow time-series data are stored in a DSS
> file. The user either can input the data manually into HEC-HMS using
> the appropriate dialog boxes or can tell HMS to access the data from a
> DSS file where they are stored. HEC-HMS can use more than one DSS file
> for a project. There is always one DSS file associated with the
> project, which stores output. A second DSS file (or more) can hold
> precipitation and observed flow data as well as other user- entered
> data (see user's manual for more detail).
>
> While the HEC-DSS software package is an improved means of man- aging
> hydrologic data, there is no easy way to transfer the data from a
> spreadsheet to a HEC-DSS file. HEC-DSS utility software available for
> download from the USACE website given in Appendix E will allow import
> and export of data from text files for input to HEC-HMS.
>
> **Running HEC-HMS and Viewing Results**
>
> The user may specify different data sets for each component within a
> project and then run the hydrologic simulation using different
> combinations of mod- els. For example, one can run a 10-year or a
> 100-year frequency storm model using the same basin model and control
> specifications to compare the result- ing flows. Or, one can model the
> effects of adding diversions and reservoirs to a basin by saving it
> under a different name, altering the new basin model, and running the
> simulation under the same precipitation and control speci- fications.
> With several basin models saved in the same project, running
> simulations with various models is a simple task. In order to create
> the sce- nario for a particular run, go to "Simulation run" under
> Compute in the main
>
> file menu. Select one basin model, one meteorologic model, and one
> control specification. Then run the scenario by selecting "Select
> run," and subse- quently "Compute run," both of which are under
> Compute in the main file menu. If changes are made to one of the
> models after a run with the same configuration has been calculated,
> select the correct run to recalculate. Note that the "Compute" tab
> beneath the Watershed Explorer allows the user to easily select
> different runs.
>
> Results can be viewed by going to the "Results" tab beneath the
> Watershed Explorer, clicking on any object (e.g., subbasin or
> junction) in the basin model, and selecting from the menu. The program
> gives the result- ing times and flows for each basin element and its
> immediate upstream ele- ments in the form of a graph, summary table,
> or time-series table. The graph shows time vs. flow, the summary table
> shows peak flows and corresponding times, and the time-series table
> gives the inflow and outflow for each time step. For subbasins, HMS
> also shows the precipitation, loss, excess, and base- flow in each
> form of viewing results. Junction plots show tributary hydro- graphs
> and their combined result. Examples of resulting hydrographs are
> presented at the end of Section 5.6. Subbasin output hydrographs
> plotted with rainfall can be obtained by clicking on the appropriate
> icon. Summary table information is also available for each junction or
> subarea.
>
> **Other Features**
>
> HEC-HMS includes advanced features such as parameter estimation with
> optimization, soil moisture accounting, GIS and grid-cell hydrology,
> snow- melt simulation, and improved hydraulics. HEC-GeoHMS is a
> companion program that allows for the creation of HEC-HMS projects
> from GIS sources, including digital elevation models, land use data,
> and other elec- tronic sources (see Chapter 10).
>
> The parameter estimation and optimization function is used to com-
> pare resulting hydrographs to observed hydrographs, so at least one
> element in the basin must have observed data. The program
> automatically estimates the parameters in order to find the best fit
> of the generated hydrograph to the observed one for one element. It
> allows the user to set initial values for the parameters of each
> element along with maximum and minimum values so that the parameter
> values estimated by the program must fall in a reason- able range. The
> optimization function measures the degree of variation between the two
> hydrographs based on four possible choices: peak-weighted RMS error,
> sum of squared residuals, sum of absolute values, or percent error in
> peak flow. The program is run iteratively until the user is satisfied
> with the objective function value, which is zero if the hydrographs
> match identically.
>
> The development of HEC-HMS is a project that continues to evolve with
> time; users should periodically check the HEC U.S. Army Corp of
> Engineer's (ACOE) website for updates. For further information and
> help
>
> with HEC-HMS, the user's manual can be downloaded from the HEC web-
> site: [http://www.hec.usace.army.mil.](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/)
> The latest updates and other informa- tion can be found on the ACOE's
> web page (see Appendix E for more details). Version 3.5 is a
> significant improvement over earlier versions and is available to
> anyone for free (see Appendix E).
>
> **EXAMPLE 5--1**
>
> **SMALL-WATERSHED EXAMPLE (HEC-HMS)**
>
> A small undeveloped watershed has the parameters listed in the accom-
> panying tables. A unit hydrograph and Muskingum routing coefficients
> are known for subbasin 3, shown in Figure E5--1(a). *TC* and *R*
> values (Clark UH from Table 5.10) for subbasins 1 and 2 and associated
> SCS curve numbers (CN) are provided as shown. A 5-hr rainfall
> hyetograph in in./hr is shown in Figure E5--1(b) for a storm event
> that occurred on May 5, 2011. Assume that the rain fell uniformly over
> the watershed. Use the information given to develop a HEC-HMS input
> data set to model this storm. Run the model to determine the predicted
> outflow at point *B*.

> **Rainfall Data**
>
> The HEC-HMS model can accept rainfall data in a number of ways: his-
> torical data from recording or non-recording gages or design storm
> data. When using data from gages spaced unevenly across a given
> watershed, the gage values should be weighted accordingly. The
> Thiessen method is the usual approach. Although not discussed in this
> example (see Chapter 1), problems 5.10--5.11 address the Thiessen
> method for subbasin data when only gage values are known.
>
> The 10-yr and 100-yr synthetic 24-hr design storms for the Houston
> area are depicted in Table 5--9 and Figure 5--8 (TSARP, 2002). For
> example, the HEC-HMS model accepts input data for the 15-min, 2-hr,
> 3-hr, 6-hr, 12-hr, and 24-hr total design rainfalls, and then
> distributes the data as a bar graph by centering the maximum at a
> user-specified point in time (i.e., 33%, 50%, 67%, or 75% of storm
> duration), according to agency standards. Thus, one can input any
> design rainfall into HEC-HMS, calculate the outflow hydrograph, and
> compare the result with a given historical rainfall. In this way, one
> can deter- mine the approximate frequency of occurrence of the
> historical storm. In prac- tice, a range of design storms including
> the 2-yr, 5-yr, 10-yr, 25-yr, 50-yr, 100-yr, and 500-yr rainfalls are
> evaluated in most flood studies.

>
> In the case study of Winterday Creek, the Clark (*TC* & *R*) method
> will be used to illustrate its applications to an urban watershed. The
> *TC* & *R* method is summarized in Table 5--10 with empirical
> equations that have been devel- oped for the Harris County (Houston)
> area in Texas. The equations used here are based on the analysis of a
> number of watersheds along the Texas Gulf Coast (Harris County Flood
> Control District, 1983; TSARP, 2002). Many similar equations have been
> generated for other urban areas and regions across the country, and
> the user of HEC-HMS is strongly urged to evaluate the *TC* & *R*
> method carefully before applying it to any ungaged watersheds.
>
> The physical parameters presented in Table 5--8 were used to develop
> the values for *TC* & *R* shown in Table 5--11. Generally, the lower
> the percent development and percent conveyance in a subbasin, the
> higher the value of *TC* & *R*. Thus, subbasin 2 has the highest value
> of *TC* & *R* and has the flat- test UH response. Individual values
> for each subbasin are input into HEC- HMS using the transform tab in
> the subbasin editor. Note also that SCS Curve Number method was
> selected for infiltration losses and the corre- sponding parameters
> were inserted in the subbasin editor under the loss rate tab (Table
> 5--8(b)).
>
> **Hydrograph and Channel Routing**
>
> The HEC-HMS model calculates outflow hydrographs for each subbasin
> based on unit hydrographs. For this watershed, the flood hydrographs
> from subbasins 1 and 2 are computed for the outlet of those subbasins
> (point *A* in Fig. 5--7(a)). The storm hydrograph from subbasin 3 is
> assumed to occur at point *B*, and the hydrograph from subbasin 4 is
> assumed to occur at point *C*. It is therefore required that the
> combined hydrograph from subbasins 1 and 2 at point *A* be flood
> routed through reach *AB* and then combined with the
>
> **Table 5--10** Equations for *TC* & *R* Method for Houston, Texas
>
> The method requires that (*TC* + *R*) and *TC* are computed from the
> following formulas, then
>
> *R* is found by subtraction of the two, where *R* = (*TC* + *R*) -

> **Flood Control Alternatives**
>
> Once a watershed has been evaluated under existing conditions of land
> use and channel morphology, the HEC-HMS model can be used to test
> flood control plans that might include a reservoir or detention pond
> to increase storage in the watershed. Some diversion of part of the
> flow to another watershed where storage is available might also be
> possible. These possi- bilities are investigated with HEC-HMS in this
> section.
>
> A powerful feature of the HEC-HMS model is its ability to represent
> changes in watershed physiography or land use that may occur as a
> water- shed develops. For Winterday Creek, we will consider two
> examples: (1) a large detention pond at point *B* for the storage of
> flood waters from sub- basins 1, 2, and 3, and (2) the diversion of a
> portion of the flow at point *B* into a diversion channel that leads
> to another watershed. In both cases, the watershed will be assumed to
> have existing land use (Fig. 5--7(b)).
>
> To input a detention pond into HEC-HMS, the storage routing data must
> be changed to represent the storage--discharge relation for the
> particu- lar detention pond. The pond data are located in the input
> through logical placement so that all contributing hydrographs route
> through the pond. The starting water elevation in the pond depends on
> the operation of the system. The discharge characteristics can be
> considered in detail through options available in the model, but
> generally pipe flow is assumed for low flows and weir flow for flood
> levels. Details on equations that govern such flows are provided in
> Chapters 4 and 7.
>
> The input data of the detention pond in HEC-HMS are depicted in Table
> 5--14. The storage--discharge data are based on pond geometry, which
> is a func- tion of available land area and available outfall depth.
> The existing 100-yr peak flow in the water is 4197 cfs at point *B*
> and 9024 cfs at the outlet (*C*). To control the peak flows at the
> point B and at the outlet of the watershed, a pond was located just
> upstream of point *B* along the stream (Fig. 5--7(b)). Table 5--15
> shows the relative effects of this pond compared with existing
> conditions. Add- ing a pond yields a 50% reduction in peak flow at the
> 100-yr level through the pond and a 24% reduction in peak flow through
> point *C* (Fig. 5--9).

> A second alternative for flood control is **diversion** of flood

> must be an adjacent watershed or stor- age area that can receive the
> excess flood water, it can be a viable alternative in some cases. For

> One final exercise with the HEC-HMS model application to this
> watershed is a consideration of full development conditions in the
> water- shed, which is consistent with the future conditions in
> Houston. As the watershed proceeds to full urbanization, significant
> changes in UH and loss rate parameters will be needed in the model.
> There would also be associ- ated channelization of laterals and the
> main stream, which may require changes in the routing parameters in
> the model. From the previous discus- sion of effects of urbanization,
> it should be clear that full development will worsen the flood
> problem, especially downstream. Homework problem 5.5 explores this
> issue in more detail. Once developed, the HEC-HMS model for a

>
> **SUMMARY** Simulation models in hydrology have been developed and
> applied over the last four decades with remarkable success. These
> models incorporate various equa- tions to describe hydrologic
> processes in space and time. Complex rainfall pat- terns affecting
> large watersheds can be simulated, and computer models can be used to
> test various design and control schemes. A selected number of the most
> popular rainfall--runoff models for hydrologic simulation are
> contained in Table 5--4. Models of some note include HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS,
> HSPF, SWMM, and Vflo and are some of the most popular and
> comprehensive models for detailed water- shed analysis**.**
>
> The second half of the chapter is devoted to a detailed presentation
> of HEC- HMS developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, considered
> by many to be the most versatile and most often used hydrologic model.
> It is the model of choice for most floodplain computations performed
> in the United States by various agencies such as FEMA and local
> drainage districts (HEC, 2006, 2010). Homework problems 5.1--5.12
> concern a detailed case study and application of HEC-HMS to an urban
> watershed in Houston, Texas. Input data for the model are developed,
> using the Clark UH methods (*TC* & *R*), Muskingum Routing method,
> rain gage data, and several design storms, and the results from each
> are compared. The problems also introduce the effects of development
> within a watershed and explore the Green and Ampt method to account
> for infiltration losses. Several flood control alternatives are
> modeled, including flow diversion and detention ponds at critical
> locations, to demonstrate the overall capabili- ties of the HEC-HMS
> program.

> **PROBLEMS** *Problems 5.1 through 5.12 deal with a hypothetical
> watershed with the following pa- rameters. Problems 5.1 through 5.5

1.  Calculate the *TC* & *R* coefficients for each subbasin in the given
    watershed shown in Figure P5--1. Assume that the equations listed in
    Table 5--10 are ap- plicable and that *S* = *S*~0~.

**Figure P5--1**

2.  Create the basin model of the watershed in HEC-HMS using the data
    provided. Set up input data for the watershed using Clark's UH
    method (*TC* & *R*). Use Muskingum routing methods and assume that
    *K* = 0.60 hr and *x* = 0.5 in reaches 1, 2, and 3. Assume two
    subreaches in each reach and assume baseflow is zero.

3.  Using the data shown in Table 5--9, create two meteorologic models
    in HEC- HMS using the 24-hr hypothetical design storms for the
    100-yr frequency and the 10-yr frequency events. Place the peak
    center at 50% for both storms and use 20-min maximum intensity
    duration.

4.  Create a new basin model for HEC-HMS Problem 5.2 to reflect a
    detention pond near Junction 2. Assume that the pond can be modeled
    in such a way

> that only the runoff from subbasin 3 should be routed through it. The
> storage-- discharge relation is given as follows:

10. Rain gage data are given in Table P5--10(a) for three rain gages
    within the wa- tershed. Weight the gage data over the five subareas
    according to the weighting values given in Table P5--10(b) (see
    Example 1--3 in Chapter 1). Set up the me- teorological model for
    subareas 1 through 5 in the watershed to reference this storm's
    rainfall data. For example, subbasin 2 receives 1/3 of gage 100R
    rainfall and 2/3 of gage 200R rainfall. Enter the actual rain gage
    data and weights into HEC-HMS.

> **Scope of This Chapter**
>
> This chapter describes techniques commonly applied in urban hydrology,
> emphasizing techniques not already discussed earlier in the text and
> modify- ing conventional techniques specifically for the urban
> situation. Modifica- tions include unique loss estimates for
> calculation of rainfall excess, decreased lag times in unit hydrograph
> (UH) procedures, and emphasis on kinematic wave techniques for
> overland flow routing. The choice of input rainfall for construction
> of a design hyetograph is of special importance in urban hydrology
> because impervious urban surfaces rapidly convert the rain- fall to
> runoff, such that short-time increment variations in the rainfall
> hyeto- graph usually create similar variations in the runoff
> hydrograph. Sewer hydraulics and options for control of urban flooding
> are discussed.
>
> Several comprehensive computer models also are available for applica-
> tion in urban situations; the chapter culminates in a review of such
> models plus a case study involving the EPA Storm Water Management
> Model, SWMM5. A considerable volume of literature is available on
> urban hydrology, including

> **Introduction**
>
> Although the same physical principles hold as elsewhere in the
> hydrologic cycle, the hydrology of urban areas is dominated by two
> distinct character- istics: (1) the preponderance of impervious
> surfaces (e.g., pavement, roofs) and (2) the presence of man-made or
> hydraulically "improved" drainage systems (e.g., a sewer system).
> Thus, the response of an urban catchment to rainfall is much faster
> than that of a rural catchment of equivalent area, slope, and soils.
> In addition, the runoff volume from an urban catchment is larger
> because there is less pervious area available for infiltration. These
> well-documented characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6--1. While

> faster response and greater runoff volumes may aggravate the

> Drainage systems in urban areas may rely on natural channels, but most
> cities have a sewer network for removal of stormwater. If the system
> is exclu- sively for stormwater removal, it is called a **storm
> sewer**. If the same conduit also carries domestic sewage, it is
> called a **combined sewer**. A combined sewer usually has a regulator
> (hydraulic control structure such as a weir or orifice) at its
> downstream end that diverts the dry-weather flow (domestic and
> industrial sewage) into an **interceptor**, which carries it to a
> treatment plant (Fig. 6--2). During wet weather, when the hydraulic

> interceptor and the regulator are exceeded, the combined sewer
> overflow (CSO, a mixture of stormwater and sewage) is released
> directly to the receiv- ing water body, with the potential for
> pollution problems. When the storm- water and domestic sewage are
> carried in separate conduits, the drainage system is said to be
> **separated**, as opposed to combined. Most newer cities have separate
> systems, but many older cities (e.g., Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta,
> Chicago, San Francisco) retain their combined systems, especially in
> the northeastern and midwestern United States.
>
> Storm and combined sewers are installed to remove stormwater from the
> land surface, thus preventing flooding and permitting normal transpor-
> tation on highways and the like. As such, they are usually designed to
> han- dle a peak flow corresponding to a given return period (Chapter
> 3) according to local regulations (2--10 yr for suburban drainage and
> 10--50 yr for major highways are typical). It should always be
> remembered that a storm (or combined) sewer system is a **minor
> drainage system** for stormwa- ter. That is, if the capacity is
> exceeded, the runoff will then find an alterna- tive pathway along the
> surface, or **major drainage system**. If the surface system (streets,
> for instance) is not designed to accommodate it, then the surface flow
> may flow through structures, with disastrous consequences. In other
> words, the major drainage system should always be designed with
> consideration of the possibility of failure or exceedance of the minor
> system (see Chapter 9).
>
> **The Engineering Problem in Urban Hydrology**
>
> The engineering problem in urban hydrology usually consists of the
> need to control peak flows and maximum depths throughout the drainage
> system. If the hydraulic grade line is too high, sewers may
> **surcharge**; that is, the water level may rise above the crown (top)
> of the sewer conduit, leading occasion- ally to basement flooding or
> discharge to streets. New facilities must be designed to minimize such
> occurrences, and existing drainage systems must often be modified
> ("**retrofitted**") to correct for them. Exceeding the capac- ity of
> an existing system is a problem that often occurs in newly developed
> areas that are served by an old sewer system.
>
> The water quality of urban runoff may also be poor (Environmental
> Protection Agency, 1983; Huber, 1993; Novotny, 1995), and special
> measures may be required simply to improve the quality of the runoff
> prior to dis- charge into receiving waters. This is especially true
> for the discharge of com- bined sewer overflows (Water Pollution
> Control Federation, 1989; Water Environment Federation and American
> Society of Civil Engineers, 1998).
>
> Alternatives for control of urban runoff quantity are many; a
> represen- tative list is given in Table 6--1 and discussed later. In
> new developments, it may be possible to provide retention (e.g., by
> infiltration) and detention to reduce downstream effects, but this is
> seldom an economical alternative for remediation of older systems in
> dense urban settings. Attenuation of flood

> Data and information needed for analysis of problems in urban

> hydrology---for example, information on rainfall, surface catchment
> characteristics, and characteristics of the drainage system, natural
> or man made. When ana- lytical methods are used to calculate
> hydrographs, it is highly desirable to have measurements available
> with which to calibrate and verify predictions (Chapters 2 and 9).

> from the land surface, followed by a method for routing flows through
> the drainage system. All standard computer models are available for
> microcomputers, and most techniques can easily be programmed in a
> spreadsheet or in a formal lan- guage (e.g., FORTRAN, C, BASIC, Java).
>
> **Design Objectives**
>
> The engineering objective when dealing with urban hydrology is to
> provide for control of peak flows and maximum depths at all locations
> within the drainage system while simultaneously protecting the
> environment. In essence it is the same flood control problem dealt
> with in Chapter 4, but with the added considerations associated with
> urbanization. Secondary issues include minimization of increased
> runoff volumes as well as basement flood- ing, surcharging, and water
> quality control.
>
> The analytical problems that must be solved to address these objec-
> tives are the predictions of runoff peaks, volumes, and complete
> hydro- graphs anywhere in the drainage system. These problems are
> often separated into those involving the surface drainage system, for
> which rain- fall must be converted into an overland flow hydrograph
> (or inlet hydro- graph, for flow into the inlet to the sewer system),
> and those involving the channel or sewer system, which often may be
> handled through conventional flow routing techniques (Chapter 4).
> However, there is a tendency in urban hydrology to lump the two
> systems together and produce one aggregate
>
> hydrograph (or peak flow or runoff volume) at the system outlet, such
> as by a unit hydrograph.
>
> The distinction between the needs to predict peak flows, runoff vol-
> umes, and complete hydrographs is important, since the three
> objectives may require very different analytical methods. In general,
> predictions of peaks and volumes lend themselves to simplified
> techniques, while hydrographs require a more comprehensive analysis.
>
> Estimation of base flow in urban drainage systems also requires
> special consideration, since water may enter the channels both as
> infiltration (seep- age into a conduit or open channel from ground
> water) and as domestic sewage. The total of the two is often evaluated
> from monitoring at down- stream treatment plants or from special
> infiltration/inflow (I/I) studies (Environmental Protection Agency,
> 1977; Pitt et al., 1993).
>
> A further distinction will be made regarding the application of ana-
> lytical techniques---namely, the design of new systems vs. the
> alleviation of drainage problems in old ones. More options are usually
> available for the former, whereas existing systems may impose severe
> constraints on control options for the latter.
>
> **Rainfall--Runoff**
>
> Conversion of rainfall into runoff in urban areas is usually somewhat
> simpli- fied because of the relatively high imperviousness of such
> areas, although in residential and open-land districts the calculation
> of infiltration into pervious surfaces may still represent a critical
> factor in the analysis. Infiltration esti- mates are complicated by
> the fact that urban soils are inevitably disturbed, and estimates
> based on data for natural soils may be in error (Pitt et al., 1999,
> 2001). Once computed, however, rainfall excess may be converted into a
> runoff hydrograph using almost any of the methods used for natural
> catch- ments (Chapter 2).
>
> When hydrographs are to be computed, special effort is required to
> obtain adequate rainfall data. This is because urban areas respond
> quickly to rainfall transients, in contrast to natural catchments,
> which dampen out short- term fluctuations. Thus, rainfall data should
> be available at 5-min or shorter increments to predict the runoff
> hydrograph adequately. Since 5-min data are seldom available, 15-min
> data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the U.S.
> National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administra- tion (NOAA) are
> often the next best resource (Appendix E). A further con- sideration
> is the storm direction; as for natural catchments, the hydrograph can
> have a considerably higher peak if the storm moves down the catchment
> toward the outlet. This means that one rain gage is seldom sufficient;
> at least three, plus a wind measurement, may be necessary to describe
> the dynamics of moving storms (James and Scheckenberger, 1984). Radar
> provides an excellent means of tracking moving storms (Chapter 11).

> The urban catchment is characterized by its area, shape, slope, soils,
> land use, imperviousness, roughness, and storage. The area and
> imperviousness are the two most important parameters for a good
> prediction of hydro- graph volumes. Although it is a seemingly
> straightforward parameter, esti- mation of the percent imperviousness
> can be subtle. In particular, it is usually necessary to distinguish
> between **directly connected impervious areas** (DCIA) and those that
> are not. Directly connected, or hydraulically effective, impervious
> areas are those that drain directly into the drainage system, such as
> a street surface with curbs and gutters that directs the run- off into
> a storm sewer inlet. **Nondirectly connected impervious areas**
> include rooftops or driveways that drain onto pervious areas. Runoff
> from such areas does not enter the storm drainage system unless the
> pervious areas become saturated.
>
> Estimates of imperviousness can be made by measuring such areas on
> aerial photographs or by considering land use; typical values are
> shown in Table 6--2. More recent data compiled using a geographical
> information sys- tem (GIS) are presented by Field et al. (2000) and
> Lee and Heaney (2003). For large urban areas, imperviousness can be
> estimated on the basis of pop- ulation density (e.g., Stankowski,

> **Lag Times**

> **Flow Routing**
>
> Flow routing through the urban drainage system may be accomplished
> using almost any of the methods discussed in Chapter 4. The task is
> made some- what easier because of the presence of uniform channel
> sections (e.g., circu- lar pipes) in the sewer system. But at the same
> time, difficulties may arise at the many junctions and hydraulic
> structures encountered in a sewer system. Most of these difficulties
> may be overcome through the use of more sophis- ticated hydraulic
> methods discussed in Section 6.5 (such as the Saint Venant equations)
> if desired (Yen, 1986); the level of the analysis should be tailored
> to the desired accuracy of the predictions, and all predictions should
> be verified against measured flows wherever possible.

> **Data Sources**
>
> Rainfall is the driving force in most hydrologic analysis. Generally,
> for urban hydrology, shorter time increment data (15-min or less) are
> better because of the shorter response times of urban basins. Two
> types of rainfall data are commonly required in urban hydrology: (1)
> "raw" point precipitation data (i.e., actual hyetographs) and (2)
> processed data, usually in the form of fre- quency information.
> Computerized point precipitation data are available from the NCDC
> (Asheville, North Carolina 28801-2696, http://www.ncdc. noaa.gov/) in
> the form of hourly or 15-min values from recording rain gages.
> Recently, 5-min data are available for a number of stations, with the
> period of record beginning at about the year 2000
> (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ asos-fivemin/). The hourly data
> were historically given in the monthly "Cli- matological Data,"
> published for each state by the National Weather Service (NWS).
> Photocopies of some older rain gage charts are available for desired
> dates from the NCDC if more detailed time resolution is needed. The
> NWS network of weather stations is the prime source for all
> meteorological data, but its data may often be supplemented by other
> sources that collect data continuously or as part of special projects.
> These sources include the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Natural
> Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Army Corps of Engineers
> (ACOE) as well as state agen- cies, the state climatologist, local
> utilities, and universities. Finally, radar rainfall data may be used,
> as described in Chapter 11. It is often necessary to contact several
> agencies to obtain all available data for a catchment.
>
> It is useful to note that the rainfall data published in the NWS's
> printed publications are often slightly different from the
> computerized data obtained from the NCDC because the values come from
> different rain gages. These

> regarded as "official."
>
> Processed data include many varieties of statistical summaries, but
> the most common type of processed data used in urban hydrology is in
> the form of intensity--duration--frequency (IDF) curves, shown in
> Figure 1--15 and later in this chapter. IDF curves are available from

> the NRCS, and local sources such as state departments of
> transportation (e.g., Weldon, 1985; Oregon Department of
> Transportation, 2005). The best infor- mation usually comes from local
> sources, an increasing amount of which may be found on the web, e.g.,

> point:

> **Rainfall Measurement**
>
> As mentioned earlier, a unique aspect of urban hydrology is the fast
> response of an urban catchment to the rainfall input. This means that
> high-frequency information in the rainfall signal is transformed into
> high-frequency pulses in the runoff hydrograph, since the highly
> impervious urban catchment does not significantly dampen such
> fluctuations. In most cases, a tipping-bucket rain gage will provide
> an adequate resolution of high frequencies, in contrast to weighing
> bucket gages, which are also commonly employed. Tipping- bucket gages
> (Chapter 1) are much easier to install in a network because the
> electrical pulses can be transmitted over a telephone or other
> communica- tion device or recorded on a data logger at the site. In
> most urban modeling work, it is necessary to have hyetographs with
> 5-min or better resolution, although this may be relaxed somewhat for
> larger basins.
>
> Unless the catchment is very small (such that a storm completely
> "covers" the basin spatially), the outfall hydrograph will also be
> sensitive to the storm direction (James and Shtifter, 1981). To
> simulate the effects of a moving (or kinematic) storm, it is necessary
> to have more than one rain gage so that the longitudinal movement (up
> or down the basin) can be defined. Movement of the storm *across* the
> flow direction does not affect the hydrograph as much as longitudinal
> movement. These effects can be seen in Figure 6--4.
>
> **Intensity--Duration--Frequency Curves: Use and Misuse**
>
> IDF curves summarize *conditional* probabilities (frequencies) of
> rainfall depths or average intensities. Specifically, IDF curves are
> graphical repre- sentations of the probability that a certain average
> rainfall intensity will occur, given a duration; their derivation is
> discussed by McPherson (1978). For example, IDF curves for Houston,
> TX, are shown in Figure 1--15 and for Tallahassee, Florida, are shown
> in Figure 6--5 (Weldon, 1985). The return

> period of an average intensity of 3.6 in./hr for a duration of 40 min
> in Tallahassee is 5 yr. (As described in Chapter 3, the return period

> IDF curves---and the duration is *not* the duration of an actual
> rainstorm.
>
> A critical characteristic of IDF curves is that the intensities are
> indeed averages over the specified duration and *do not represent
> actual time histories of rainfall*. The contour for a given return
> period could rep- resent the smoothed results of several different

> rather, it is merely a 20-min period, say, within a longer storm of
> any duration, during which the aver- age intensity happened to be the
> specified value. In fact, given that the IDF curves are really
> smoothed contours, unless a data point falls on a contour, they are
> completely hypothetical! A detailed analysis of the method of
> constructing IDF curves and the perils of improper interpreta- tion is
> given by McPherson (1978).
>
> To reiterate, (1) IDF curves do *not* represent time histories of real
> storms---the intensities are *averages* over the indicated duration,
> (2) a single curve represents data from several different storms, (3)
> the duration is *not* the duration of an actual storm and most likely
> represents a shorter period within a longer storm, and (4) it is
> incorrect to use IDF curves to obtain a storm event volume because the
> duration must be arbitrarily assigned. The preponderance of IDF
> information in the hydrologic litera- ture is primarily a result of
> the need for IDF curves for use in the rational method (described in
> Section 6.4). As will be seen, the IDF data are prop- erly applied in
> this case.

> **Definition of a Storm Event**
>
> Return periods (or frequencies) can be assigned to rainfall events on
> the basis of several different parameters, but most commonly on the
> basis of total volume, average intensity, peak intensity, duration, or
> interevent time. To work with any of these parameters, the rainfall
> time series must first be separated into a series of discrete,
> independent events. When this is done, they may be ranked by volume or
> any desired parameter and a conventional frequency analysis performed
> (Chapter 3).
>
> For ease of computation, a statistical measure is usually employed to
> separate independent storm events. A minimum interevent time (MIT) is
> defined such that rainfall pulses separated by a time less than this
> value are considered part of the same event. The process can be
> illustrated by an example.

> When an MIT value of zero is used, all rainfall hours are considered
> to be separate events; hence the number of events is equal to the
> number of rainfall hours. For an MIT value of 1 hr, at least 1 dry
> hour is required to separate events, leading to the seven events
> (clusters of contiguous wet hours) given in the table. Since there are

> Several possibilities exist for a statistical measure with which to

> al., 1977; Tavares, 1975). However, the easiest definition

> rainfalls in Tallahassee, Florida, are shown in Table 6--4, for which
> the MIT is 5 hr. It is clear that these volumes can arise from actual
> storms of greatly differing durations, certainly not fixed as on an
> IDF curve. For comparison, 24-hr depths are also shown, taken from IDF
> data for the Tallahassee region (Wel- don, 1985). Notice that the

> **Choice of Design Rainfall**
>
> Often in an urban analysis it is necessary to provide a design storm
> for a model with which to evaluate the effectiveness of a drainage
> system. Ideally these rainfall inputs consist of measured hyetographs
> obtained during a monitoring program of the catchment and are used for
> calibration and veri- fication of a model. In this case, there is
> little question about the choice of rainfall input, but more often
> than not an agency will require a design storm corresponding to a
> specified return period, such as a 25-yr storm. There are several ways
> to define such an event, and the method of constructing and applying a
> design storm can be very controversial (Adams and Howard, 1985;
> Harremšeös, 1983; McPherson, 1978; Patry and McPherson, 1979; Debo and
> Reese, 2003).
>
> The first question is, to what storm parameter does the return period
> apply? That is, is it a 25-yr storm based on runoff volume, peak flow,
> aver- age flow, or rainfall volume, rainfall average intensity, and so
> on? Equally important, given that antecedent conditions in the
> catchment can be highly variable and that the catchment will alter the
> nature of the rainfall input in any case, the return period of a storm
> based on rainfall characteristics will *not,* in general, be the same
> as the return period of the same storm based on runoff
> characteristics. For example, the 25-yr storm based on rainfall volume
> may be only the 5-yr storm based on runoff volume if the catchment is
> dry before the storm occurs. (This characteristic is illustrated in
> the SWMM5 example at the end of this chapter.) Thus, it is an error to
> assign a return period to a runoff characteristic based on a frequency
> anal- ysis of rainfall.
>
> **Synthetic Design Storms**
>
> The use of IDF curves (e.g., Fig. 6--5) is intimately linked to most
> of the methods for constructing **synthetic** (hypothetical) **design
> storms**. A typical synthetic design storm is constructed in the
> following manner (e.g., King County, 1995; Debo and Reese, 2003).
> First, a duration is specified, often arbitrarily by an agency, say 24
> hr. Second, the 24-hr depth is obtained from an IDF curve for the
> desired return period. Third, the rainfall must be dis- tributed in
> time to construct the synthetic hyetograph. There are major
> differences in the literature in this last step (Arnell, 1982). The
> shape varies, mainly depending on the type of storm to be simulated: A
> cyclonic storm usually has the highest intensities near the middle,
> and a convective storm usually has the highest intensities near the
> beginning. However, in the United States, temporal distributions
> published by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the
> SCS) are often used, such as the type II distribution in the Southeast
> and type 1A distribution in the Pacific Northwest.
>
> **EXAMPLE 6--4**
>
> **CONSTRUCTION OF SCS TYPE II, 24-HR DESIGN STORM**
>
> Construct a 5-yr, 24-hr design storm for Tallahassee, using the SCS
> type II distribution.
>
> **SOLUTION**
>
> The distribution (percentage mass curve) is tabulated in Table E6--4.
> The duration of the design storm must be 24 hr to use the SCS type II
> distribution, which is specifically given for a 24-hr duration. From
> the Tallahassee IDF curve shown in Figure 6--5, the average intensity
> for 24 hr and a 5-yr return period is 0.305 in./hr. This leads to a
> total depth for 24 hr of 7.32 in., as indicated in Table 6--4. The
> total depth is allocated over the hourly increments in Table E6--4,
> and the average intensities for each hour are plotted in Figure E6--4.
> Because the time interval used is 1 hr, average intensities are the
> same numerically as incremental depths, which are not shown. Notice
> the very high intensity during hour 12, re- flecting the fact that
> 42.5% (i.e., 66% --23.5%, from Table E6--4) of the total rainfall is
> assumed to occur during this interval.

> **Alternatives to Synthetic Design Storms**
>
> Synthetic design storms are very popular because they are relatively
> easy to construct and use. They require only IDF curves and an assumed
> shape for the hyetograph, not extensive historic rainfall data, and
> they may be consis- tently applied by oversight agencies. What are the
> alternatives? The best method is to analyze historical runoff data for
> the catchment to identify storms of interest based on a frequency
> analysis of peak flows, flood depths, runoff volumes, and so on. The
> storms that caused, say, the 5-yr peak flow could then be used for
> design purposes (given adequate information on ante- cedent
> conditions). This would involve several storms, with very different
> temporal distributions, each with a return period close to 5 yr, based
> on some criterion. The case study at the conclusion of this chapter
> illustrates a collec- tion of such storms, based on simulation
> results, not monitoring results.
>
> Selection of storms from a monitoring program is seldom possible in
> urban areas because flow-monitoring programs are typically short, and
> there may be extensive development underway in the catchment that
> alters the rainfall--runoff mechanisms, thus destroying the
> homogeneity of the runoff record. Probably the best alternative is to
> apply a continuous simulation model to simulate runoff hydrographs for
> a period of, say, 25 yr based on historic rainfall records available
> from the NCDC. When available, 15-min data are preferable to the more
> common 1-hr data. The model must first be calibrated using measured
> rainfall and runoff data. A frequency analysis can then be performed
> on the simulated hydrographs---on the parameters of interest---from
> which historical design storms can be identified for more detailed
> analysis (Huber et al., 1986). (The detailed analysis must also have a
> means for establishing the correct antecedent conditions, a problem
> auto- matically handled during the continuous simulation.) Both of
> these options (frequency analysis of measured or simulated
> hydrographs) have the advan- tage of an analysis of runoff, not of
> rainfall. This continuous simulation approach is routinely used by the
> USGS to develop its regional flood fre- quency data and is
> demonstrated in the case study at the end of this chapter.
>
> A third alternative is a frequency analysis on rainfall *events,*
> similar to that shown in Table 6--4. If historical events from such an
> analysis are sub- sequently used for design storms, the disadvantage
> remains of basing return periods on rainfall characteristics instead
> of on runoff characteristics, but at least there would not be an
> assumption of a duration. A frequency analysis of rainfall statistics
> can also be used in a **derived distribution** approach, in which the
> frequency distribution of runoff is derived from the frequency
> distribution of rainfall (Adams and Papa, 2000).
>
> To summarize, the use of historical storms for design purposes is pre-
> ferred because the frequency analysis can be directed to the specific
> param- eter of interest without an assumed duration and because there
> is no need to make an arbitrary assumption about the shape of the
> hyetograph. The use of historical storms also has an advantage when
> dealing with the public, because a design can be presented to prevent
> the flooding that occurred
>
> from a specific real event in the public's memory. The main
> disadvantage is simply the extra effort involved in a continuous
> simulation or a frequency analysis based on storm events rather than
> on conditional frequencies read- ily available from published IDF
> data. As a result, synthetic design storms are most often used in
> practice.
>
> A final word of caution is warranted regarding continuous simulation.
> Because there are seldom enough long-term rain gages to cover the
> urban area adequately, a single gage is often used to drive a
> continuous model, assuming that the entire catchment receives the
> point rainfall measured by the gage. This is an acceptable assumption
> for small catchments and/or spatially uniform (e.g., cyclonic)
> rainfall. However, for spatially variable (e.g., convective) rainfall,
> peaks may be overestimated by the model because the rainfall may not
> cover the entire basin. Long-term volumes are probably adequately
> reproduced, but peak flows identified from a fre- quency analysis
> using a modeling scheme of this sort should be reexamined on an event
> basis using a realistic spatial distribution of rainfall before being
> used for design purposes.
>
> **Peak Flow, Volume, or Hydrograph?**
>
> Recall that there are several possible parameters to be determined in
> an urban hydrologic analysis, but most often they include peak flow,
> runoff volume, or the complete runoff hydrograph. Related parameters
> might be the hydraulic grade line or flooding depths. If hydrographs
> are predicted, then peaks and volumes are an implicit part of the
> analysis, but some of the simpler methods, e.g., the rational method,
> will not necessarily provide all parameters of possible interest.
>
> **Peak Flows by the Rational Method**
>
> The rational method dates from the 1850s in Ireland (Dooge, 1973) and
> is called the Lloyd-Davies method in Great Britain. Published in the
> United States by Kuichling (1889), it is one of the simplest and
> best-known meth- ods routinely applied in urban hydrology; although it
> contains subtleties that are not always appreciated. Peak flows are
> predicted by the simple product
>

> **METHODS FOR QUANTITY ANALYSIS**
>
> where
>
> *Q~p~* = *k~c~CiA*, (6--8)
>
> *Q~p~* = peak flow (cfs or m^3^/s),
>
> *C* = runoff coefficient,
>
> *i* = rainfall intensity (in./hr or mm/hr),
>
> *A* = catchment area (ac or ha),
>
> *k~c~* = conversion factor.
>
> When U.S. customary units are used, the conversion factor *k~c~* =
> 1.008 to convert ac-in./hr to cfs and is routinely ignored; this
> simple conversion is the basis for the term *rational* in the rational
> method. (The approximate equivalence of ac-in./hr to cfs is worth
> remembering for convenient rough calculations.) For the alternative
> metric units given with Equation (6--8), the conversion factor *k~c~*
> = 0.00278 to convert ha-mm/hr to m^3^/s.
>
> Because of the assumptions regarding the homogeneity of rainfall and
> equilibrium conditions at the time of peak flow, the rational method
> should not be used on areas larger than several hundred acres (a few
> hundred hect- ares) without subdividing the overall catchment into
> subcatchments and including the effect of routing through drainage
> channels (Water Environment Federation and American Society of Civil
> Engineers, 1992). Since actual rain- fall is not homogeneous in space
> and time, the rational method becomes more conservative (i.e., it
> overpredicts peak flows) as the area becomes larger.
>
> All catchment losses are incorporated into the runoff coefficient *C*,
> which is usually given as a function of land use (Table 6--5). The
> runoff coef- ficient is higher for higher return period (more severe)
> storms because infil- tration and depression storage are relatively
> less important; values in Table 6--5 are typical for return periods of
> 2 to 10 yrs. A study for the Denver Urban Drainage and Flood Control
> District (Wright-McLaughlin Engineers, 1984) documented the effect
> qualitatively but not quantitatively. That is, runoff coefficients may
> be increased beyond the upper bounds in Table 6--5 for *T* 7 10 yr,
> but by what factor is not known. Runoff coefficients for a variety of

>
> **Coefficient and Regression Methods**
>
> Regression techniques are often incorporated into other methods such
> as synthetic unit hydrographs (Chapter 2), in which parameters of the
> hydro- graph are related to physical parameters of the urban
> catchment. Peak flows may also be found by regression analysis (e.g.,
> Bensen, 1962), but this appli- cation is usually performed only for
> large nonurban catchments. The USGS also uses regional regression
> techniques to relate frequency-analysis results to catchment
> characteristics (Sections 3.7). However, the most straightfor- ward
> application is to determine a relationship between measured values of
> desired independent and dependent variables, such as rainfall and
> runoff.
>
> When measured rainfall and runoff data are available, it is common to
> regress the runoff against the rainfall. If a linear equation is fit
> to the data, it will have the form
>
> *R* = *CR*(*P* - *DS*), (6--11)
>
> where
>
> *R* = runoff depth,
>
> *P* = rainfall depth,
>
> *CR* = slope of the fitted line (approximate runoff coefficient),
>
> *DS* = depression storage (depth).
>
> Here depths, not flows, are predicted. Since the depths are equivalent
> to volumes (when multiplied by the catchment area), depth and volume
> are often used interchangeably. The form of Equation (6--11) assumes
> that there will be no runoff until the depression storage is filled by
> rainfall. (If *DS* is negative, the equation can be rewritten to
> indicate a positive intercept on the runoff axis. This situation
> implies a base flow---that is, a contribution to runoff even with zero
> rainfall.) The slope *CR* is almost equivalent to a runoff coefficient
> \[Eq. (6--9)\], except that part of the losses is incorporated into
> the depression storage. Equation (6--11) works best for monthly or
> annual totals rather than for individual storm events and is not
> suited for situations in which there is appreciable carryover in the
> catchment storage (Diskin, 1970).

> **Regression---Flood Frequency Methods**
>
> The USGS extrapolates urban flood frequencies by regression analysis.
> Peak flow prediction by this method has been performed for urban areas
> for the United States as a whole (Sauer et al., 1983) and for many
> individual cities. For example, flood volumes and flood peaks have
> been analyzed for Talla- hassee by Franklin (1984) and Franklin and
> Losey (1984), respectively, and by Laenen (1983) for Oregon's
> Willamette Valley. The procedure is one way of performing a *regional
> analysis* and is described in Section 3.7, and exam- ple regression
> equations for Tallahassee are given in Table 3--9.
>
> **Unit Hydrographs**
>
> Unit hydrographs, introduced in Chapter 2, have also been applied in
> urban areas, with the parameters of the UH related to catchment
> parameters by regression analysis. This was first performed by
> Eagleson (1962) and later by several researchers, including Brater and
> Sherrill (1975) and Espey et al. (1977). Applications of UHs were
> presented in Chapter 2 and are an option in the HEC-HMS model (Chapter
> 5).
>
> **Time--Area Methods**
>
> Time--area methods have also been applied with success in urban areas
> because of the relative ease of estimation of losses. The origin of
> the time-- area curve was discussed in Chapter 1, but it should be
> emphasized that, strictly speaking, the isochrones of equal travel
> time shown in Figure 1--23 should be travel times of *waves,* not
> parcels of water, to reach the outlet, since the principle involved is
> one of time to equilibrium from each contrib- uting area---i.e., the
> same principle discussed earlier in the context of the kinematic wave.
> This concept is often ignored in applications of time--area methods,
> but a relatively easy correction to water parcel travel times can be
> made using Equation (6--2), in which water velocities are multiplied
> by the appropriate kinematic wave exponent to approximate wave
> velocities. Two urban models that employ time--area methods are the
> Road Research Lab- oratory (RRL) model (Stall and Terstriep, 1972;
> Watkins, 1962) and the ILLUDAS model (Terstriep and Stall, 1974). The
> time--area method is dem- onstrated in Problems 6.14 and 6.15.
>
> If the time--area diagram is approximated by an isosceles triangle,
> with base *t~c~*, and outflows are then routed through a linear
> reservoir; the tech- nique is sometimes called the O'Kelly model
> (O'Kelly, 1955; Dooge, 1973). The linear reservoir is intended to
> provide attenuation not represented by the translation effect of the
> time--area diagram. The Santa Barbara method (Stubchaer, 1975;
> Wanielista, 1990) consists of routing rainfall excess, weighted from
> impervious and pervious areas, through a linear reservoir with time
> constant equal to the time of concentration. The Santa Barbara method
> is illustrated in Problem 6.22.
>
> **Kinematic Wave Methods**
>
> The kinematic wave equations have been discussed earlier in this
> chapter as well as in Chapter 4. The numerical techniques shown in
> Chapter 4 are usu- ally necessary for urban areas with unsteady and
> nonuniform rainfall excess. However, the analytical solution for the
> case of steady, uniform rainfall excess (Eagleson, 1970) highlights
> the concept of wave travel times \[Eqs. (6--2) and (6--7)\] and the
> time of concentration \[Eq. (6--6)\], both immensely useful in urban
> hydrology. An example of a watershed model that uses kine- matic waves
> (HEC-HMS) was discussed in Chapter 5. The SWMM model (Huber and
> Dickinson, 1988; Rossman, 2005) optionally uses the kinematic wave for
> the channel routing component (see Section 4.6). A distributed model
> for overland flow based on the kinematic wave applied to a grid sys-
> tem is presented in Chapter 11.
>
> **Linear and Nonlinear Reservoirs**
>
> A catchment surface may be conceptualized as a "reservoir" with
> inflows due to rainfall (and possible upstream contributions) and
> outflows due to evaporation, infiltration, and surface runoff (Fig.
> 6--7(a)). This has led to sev- eral methods for conversion of rainfall
> into runoff, based on solutions to the reservoir routing equations
> (Dooge, 1973). For use of reservoir methods, surface storage is
> spatially lumped; that is, there is no variation with hori- zontal
> distance, and the storage is conceptualized as a "tank" with inflows
> and outflows. Spatial variations may be incorporated by distributing
> these lumped storages over the catchment to reflect parameter
> variations and so on (Fig. 6--7(b)). The distributed storages are then
> linked by channel routing routines. The equations for reservoir
> routing can be solved both for conver- sion of rainfall into runoff
> and for application to "real" reservoirs, such as detention basins.
> The latter will be described in Section 6.6.

> each pathway of a loop is a function of downstream conditions. Note

> backwater analysis (illustrated in Chapter 7).
>
> The numerical methods discussed in Chapter 4 for application to the
> Saint Venant equations can be applied equally well in urban drainage
> systems; a survey of several different approaches is given by Yen
> (1986) and Mays (2001b). Successful models have been built on the
> method of characteristics (Sevuk et al., 1973), explicit methods
> (Roesner et al., 1988), and the four-point implicit method (Cunge et
> al., 1980). However, the method of characteristics seems to have the
> most limitations regarding the special structures and flow conditions
> encountered in sewer systems; in particular, both the explicit and
> implicit methods are more easily adapted to surcharge conditions.
> Simulation models that solve the full Saint Venant equations in an
> urban setting include the dynamic routing option of SWMM5 (see Section
> 6.7; Roesner et al., 1988; Rossman, 2006), the UNET model of the Corps
> of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering Center (included with
> HEC-RAS---see Chapter 7), the FEQ ("full equations") model of the
> USGS, as well as several American and Euro- pean proprietary models.
> All models just discussed are also capable of simulat- ing the fully
> dynamic regime in natural channels, in the manner of FLDWAV (Chapter
> 4), and URLs for each are given in Appendix E.
>
> **Surcharging**
>
> Surcharging occurs when the hydraulic grade line (HGL) of the flow is
> above the sewer crown, as in the downstream segment sketched in Figure
> 6--8. If the HGL rises above the level of basement drains connected to
> the sewer system, water will be backed into basements and will cause
> basement flood- ing. Health problems may also result if combined
> sewage enters basements, as sometimes occurs in older cities. The most
> spectacular effects of surcharg- ing are blown manhole covers and
> geysers out of the sewer system when the HGL rises well above the
> ground surface. If the HGL remains below the ground surface and below
> the level of basement drains, usually no special problem is associated
> with surcharging, and the flow may even be acceler- ated by
> pressurizing the conduit.
>
> Since surcharged conduits are really just a network flowing under
> pres- surized conditions, one way of simulating the surcharge
> conditions is to treat the network like a water distribution network,
> in which an iterative solution is used for heads (HGL) at nodes while
> maintaining continuity and friction losses. This method has been
> applied on a steady-state basis by Wood and Heitzman (1983) and as
> part of the more general SWMM5 Dynamic Routing procedure (Roesner et
> al., 1988; Rossman, 2006). Another option is to use the Preissmann
> slot method, in which a small "imaginary" slot above the sewer allows
> free-surface flow to be maintained at all times and permits the use of
> only the Saint Venant equations. Models that use this scheme include
> Carredas (SOGREAH, 1977) and S11S (Hoff-Clausen et al., 1981).
>
> The transition from free-surface flow to a surcharged condition is not
> necessarily smooth and may be accompanied by the release of trapped
> air, hydraulic jumps, and pressure waves (McCorquodale and Hamam,
> 1983; Song et al., 1983). No general sewer routing model deals with
> this problem; special hydraulic model studies or numerical techniques
> are needed and must be used if it is important.
>
> **Routing at Internal Hydraulic Structures**
>
> Structures that may be found in a storm or combined sewer include
> weirs, orifices, pump stations, tide gates, storage tanks, and
> diversion structures or regulators of various kinds that may or may
> not behave as a conven- tional weir or orifice. To the extent that
> they do, Equation (6--16) may be used to represent an orifice and
> Equation (6--15) a weir. Special allowance must be made for submerged
> weirs and weirs of other geometries (see Fig. 9--17 or Davis, 1952;
> Chow, 1959; King and Brater, 1963; French, 1985; Mays, 2001b).
>
> **Side-flow weirs** are often encountered in sewer systems. An exact
> analysis requires analysis of the gradually varied flow past the weir
> (Chow, 1959; Henderson, 1966; Metcalf and Eddy, 1972; Hager, 1987;
> Debo and Reese, 2003). Early experimental work by Engels (1921)
> resulted in the following equation for total discharge over a
> side-flow weir in a rectangu- lar channel, for which the water surface
> profile rises along the length of the weir:

where

> *Q* = 3.32*L*^0.83^*h*^1.67^, (6--21)
>
> *Q* = side-flow weir discharge, cfs,
>
> *L* = weir length (in direction of main channel flow), ft,
>
> *h* = head on lower (downstream) end of weir, ft.
>
> For a more rigorous solution, the flow per unit length along the
> side-flow weir is
>
> *q* = *C~s~h*^3\>2^, (6--22)
>
> where
>
> *q* = discharge per unit length over the side weir (cfs/ft or m^2^/s),
>
> *h* = *h*(*x*) = head along the weir crest (ft or m),
>
> *C~s~* = weir coefficient (ft^1/2^/s or m^1/2^/s).
>
> The head will vary along the length of the weir, and a numerical
> solution for the head and discharge is required (Henderson, 1966;
> Metcalf and Eddy, 1972; Debo and Reese, 2003). The coefficient *C~s~*
> is a function of the geom- etry of the weir installation and of the
> upstream Froude number. As an approximation, a constant value of 4.1
> for U.S. customary units and 2.26 for metric units may be used
> (Ackers, 1957). The full functional relationship for *C~s~* is
> presented by Hager (1987).

> Similarly, a gradually varied flow analysis may be used for the exact
> analysis of flow over an open **grate inlet** on the street surface.
> Resource material for the hydraulics of flow over grate inlets on the
> surface of the ground is provided by Ring (1983), U.S. Department of

> Society of Civil Engi- neers (1992), Mays (2001b), and Debo and Reese
> (2003).

> **Tide gates**, usually in the form of **flap gates**, are often
> installed at the outlet of a sewer system to prevent backflow of the
> receiving water into the sewer conduits; they open only when the head
> inside the conduits is higher than the head in the receiving water. As
> such, they are often treated as an orifice, with discharge
> coefficients available from the manufacturer.
>
> **Pumps** are usually operated in at least two stages. The first stage
> is turned on when the water in the wet well rises to a certain level,
> and the second stage and any additional stages are started when and if
> the water rises to higher specified levels. The pumps may simply raise
> the water to a higher level for continued free-surface flow, or they

>
> Several options for control of urban runoff quantity were listed in
> Table 6--1, of which storage in one form or another is dominant.

> **CONTROL OPTIONS**
>
> **Detention/Retention**
>
> **Detention storage**, also known as **extended detention storage**,
> involves detaining or slowing runoff, as in a reservoir, and then
> releasing it, typically over a period of from 24 to 72 hours. In
> **retention storage**, runoff is not released downstream and is
> usually removed from storage only by infiltra- tion through a porous
> bottom or by evaporation. Both types of storage are very common,
> although designed retention becomes less practical as the size of the
> drainage area increases. The required retention basin volume should be
> based on an analysis of storm event volumes, as discussed in Section
> 6.3.

>
> Obtain an estimate for the size of a detention basin required to hold
> the runoff from a 5-yr (volume) storm for the 2230-ac Megginnis Arm
> catch- ment in Tallahassee, Florida.
>
> **SOLUTION**
>
> The regression relationship developed in Example 6--8 can be used as a
> very rough method for converting rainfall into runoff. The 5-yr storm
> event rainfall depth is approximately 8.18 in., from Table 6--4. Thus,
>
> runoff = 0.308(8.18 - 0.059) = 2.50 in. = 0.21 ft.
>
> The required volume is the depth times the catchment area: volume =
> 0.21 ft \* 2230 ac \* 43560 ft^3^/ac = 2.04 \* 10^7^ ft^3^.
>
> If the 5-yr, 24-hr depths of 7.32 in. from the Tallahassee IDF curves
> were used, a similar calculation would yield a runoff depth of 2.24
> in. (0.186 ft) and a volume of 1.81 \* 10^7^ ft^3^. This value is
> slightly less than that obtained from the frequency analysis of storm
> event depths.
>
> Note that this crude regression analysis ignores important factors of
> antecedent conditions, variable loss coefficients, and spatial and
> tem- poral rainfall variations that can be included in the analysis
> when using continuous simulation in rainfall--runoff models. The use
> of such output for detention basin sizing is demonstrated in the SWMM5
> case study at the end of this chapter. Methods based on design storms
> are discussed by Urbonas and Stahre (1993).
>
> Extended detention basins (also called retarding basins, or storm-
> water management basins) usually serve the multiple purposes of flood
> control and water quality control. The outlets are designed to hold a

> In-system storage can be installed in areas where cheaper surface
> stor- age is unavailable. Such storage can consist of concrete tanks

> itself, sometimes by means of adjustable weirs that are used to detain

>
> Surface storage may also be available on rooftops, in parking lots,
> and on other private lands. For example, if a roof is structurally
> suited, water may be ponded up to a few inches by using special drain
> fixtures. Rooftop vegetation for this purpose may also be
> employed---an example of "green engineering" (Field et al., 2000;
> Prince George's County, 2000; Field and Sullivan, 2003; Field et al.,

> leaks and main- tenance, and storage on private lands often is
> unsuccessful for this reason. (In general, maintenance of BMPs is a
> huge practical issue.) When storage does exist on private lands or
> adjacent to highways, an allowance for this "loss" must be made in the
> depression storage value used for the catchment.
>
> **Increased Infiltration**
>
> Since urbanization creates increased imperviousness, one likely
> control is to increase the amount of pervious area wherever possible.
> This has been accomplished with porous parking lots through the use of
> concrete block or similar shapes laid such that water can infiltrate
> through the soil-filled center. The blocks lend strength to the soil,
> and grass may grow on the soil so that the blocks are not visible.
> Monolithic permeable pavement is con- structed by leaving out most of
> the fine fraction of aggregate of the pave- ment mix, and placed like
> regular pavement (Urbonas and Stahre, 1993), and most difficulties of
> possible clogging have been overcome. Interlocking porous pavement
> does not generally have the clogging issue, depending on the paver
> hole size (Field et al., 2000). Although increased infiltration is
> very useful for small storms and for water quality control (of small
> storms), it is not of much use for larger storms, for which the soil
> may become saturated. On the other hand, vegetated areas that
> facilitate infiltration also facilitate evapotranspiration (ET).
> Increased ET is a good way to reduce stormwater runoff volumes from
> more frequent small storm events, especially when BMPs for this
> purpose are distributed around the catch- ment, in the manner of
> low-impact development (LID). Design guidelines for several types of
> LID facilities are provided by Low Impact Develop- ment Center et al.
> (2006).
>
> **Other Methods**
>
> Inlet restrictions are sometimes used in older cities that suffer from
> sur- charged sewer lines and for which storage is not an option. Such
> devices (Water Pollution Control Federation, 1989; Field et al., 2004)
> limit the rate at which surface runoff can enter the sewer system,
> thus trading off a reduc- tion in the hydraulic grade line in the
> sewer for increased street surface flooding. However, the latter is
> usually only temporary, and this measure does reduce basement
> flooding. Hence inlet restrictions may be the least expensive
> alternative in older combined sewer systems.
>
> Nonstructural alternatives include **floodplain zoning** and
> **floodproofing** of individual structures, as for general floodplain
> management (James and Lee, 1971; Mays, 2001a). Floodplain zoning
> restricts land use in flood-prone areas (often designated as the 10-yr
> or 100-yr floodplain) to compatible uses, such as parks, agriculture,
> and so on. Although some damages may still occur during flooding,
> major damage to the urban infrastructure is usually avoided.
>
> Floodproofing involves raising the foundation of structures above a
> designated flood elevation, using either fill or pilings, or "stilts."
> The methods may be used in combination, with zoning near the channel
> and floodproofing farther away (James and Lee, 1971). These two
> nonstructural alternatives are often not feasible in older cities
> because of the impossibility of relocating existing structures. Many
> additional nonstructural alternatives exist for management of
> stormwater quality (Field et al., 2006). These topics are covered in
> more detail in Chapter 12.

> **HEC-HMS**
>
> The Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) from the U.S. Army COE

> **HSPF**
>
> The first widely used continuous simulation model in hydrology was the
> Stan- ford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), which was
> first applied in watersheds in northern California. Input
> precipitation data for continuous simulation included long-term hourly
> values from the NCDC. These hydro- logic roots are incorporated into

> single-event hydrologic model that can also be used to simulate
> nonpoint source water quality processes (Bicknell et al., 1997).
> Simulation output includes time histories of the quantity and qual-
> ity of water transported over the land surface and through various
> soil zones, down to the ground water aquifer. Although most often
> applied in rural situ- ations, HSPF is readily applicable to urban
> applications through its impervi- ous land module. HSPF is also a part
> of the EPA BASINS (Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and
> Nonpoint Sources) methodology for nonpoint source evaluation (Lahlou
> et al., 1998), in which HSPF is incorporated with a GIS for

> **Natural Resources Conservation Service**
>
> The basics of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS,
> formerly the Soil Conservation Service or SCS) method (1964) have been
> presented in Chapter 2. The "method" is actually a thick handbook
> dealing with many

> of the unit hydro- graph procedures. The SCS procedures are widely
> used in engineering prac- tice, and additional source material is
> available (McCuen, 1982; Viessman and Lewis, 1996). The newest

> **SWMM**
>
> The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was developed for the
> Environmental Protection Agency in 1969--1971 as a single-event model
> for simulation of quantity and quality processes in combined sewer
> systems (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971; Huber et al., 2005). It has
> since been applied to virtually every aspect of urban drainage, from
> routine drainage design to sophisticated hydraulic analysis to
> nonpoint-source runoff quality studies, using both single-event and
> continuous simulation. By subdividing large catchments and routing
> flows down the drainage system, SWMM can be applied to catchments of
> almost any size, from parking lots to subdivisions to cities. An
> extensive literature exists for SWMM, exemplified in proceed- ings of
> the type edited by James et al. (2006).
>
> Although Version 4 of SWMM (Huber and Dickinson, 1988; Roesner et al.,
> 1988) is still useful for some purposes, most SWMM users will be best
> served by Version 5: SWMM5, released in 2004. This version has been
> care- fully recoded in the C language to eliminate errors and add
> features, and it
>
> includes a GUI. The model, code, and documentation (Rossman, 2005) may
> be freely downloaded at <http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/>
> swmm/. Notable in the documentation is an applications manual (Gironás
> et al., 2009).
>
> Runoff is generated from rainfall in SWMM using a nonlinear reservoir
> method (Example 6--9). Subsurface flow routing of water infiltrated
> through the soil surface is optional. Flow routing may be performed by
> the kinematic wave method or by using the complete Saint Venant
> equations. This dynamic wave routing remains one of the most powerful
> features of SWMM. Simula- tion of storage and hydraulic controls may
> be performed throughout the catch- ment and drainage systems. Water
> quality generation and transport may also be simulated throughout the
> catchment and drainage systems, as well as treat- ment in storage
> devices and elsewhere for modeling of most best management practices
> (BMPs). SWMM5 includes many graphical and other reporting tools. For
> instance, the statistics tool may be used to separate continuous
> simulation hydrographs and pollutographs (concentration vs. time) into
> independent storm events (as in Example 6--3), calculate statistical
> moments, and perform elementary frequency analyses. Metric units are
> optional. A detailed case study of the use of SWMM5 is given later in
> this chapter.
>
> **U.S. Geological Survey Models**
>
> The USGS is the leading federal agency for research in hydrology and
> has produced several rainfall--runoff models and flow routing software
> (e.g., the FEQ model described earlier), all of which are freely
> available from the USGS website:
> [http://water.usgs.gov/software/surface_water.html.](http://water.usgs.gov/software/surface_water.html)
> However, support for USGS surface water simulation tools is not as
> readily available as for the models previously described. In addition
> to simulation models, a large number of software packages for
> statistical analysis, sediment trans- port, scour analysis, and other
> hydrologic and hydraulic computations are also available from their
> generous website.
>
> **Model Selection**
>
> Although there may be theoretical reasons for preference of one model
> over another, the choice is often made on much more pragmatic grounds.
> Con- siderations include designation of a required model by a
> permitting agency, model support and documentation, familiarity with
> techniques used in a model, type of computer required, and
> availability of data. The last factor is probably the most important.
> For example, complex flow routing in a sewer cannot be performed
> without detailed information on invert elevations, ground surface
> elevations, and hydraulic structures in the sewer system. If such
> information is not available, a lumped parameter approach using a much
> simpler method (such as a UH) might be appropriate.
>
> When both rainfall and runoff data are available for calibration, most
> of the models discussed in this section can be calibrated for the
> catchment
>
> under consideration. In general, the simplest model that is applicable
> to the problems under study and that can be properly calibrated is
> probably the best choice. However, simple models are generally able to
> address fewer hypothetical "what-if" questions dealing with
> alternative design formula- tions, because the required physically
> based procedures may not be incor- porated into the models. Hence
> model choice is an important function of model capability as well as
> model simplicity.
>
> A sensitivity analysis of a model will reveal information on the
> relative importance of the many input parameters as well as
> uncertainty in model output (James and Kuch, 1998). This is an
> important introductory step for the use of any model.
>
> Finally, model reviews and comparative studies referenced earlier in
> this section may be consulted for guidance. Since model capabilities
> continu- ally change and improve, caution should be exercised when
> reading about models in older references and in this text. World Wide
> Web sites for all models are the best way to survey current model
> capabilities and availability.

> **Introduction**
>
> How may an urban rainfall--runoff model be applied to a real
> catchment? What kind of information results, and for what purpose? To
> illustrate the use of such a model, the calibration and verification
> of the SWMM5 model on a high-density residential (apartment)
> catchment, abbreviated HDR, in Miami, Florida, will be shown. Results
> of continuous simulations will be illustrated for purposes of
> frequency analysis and selection of design storms from the historic
> record. This particular catchment is one of four south Flor- ida
> catchments monitored by the USGS (Mattraw et al., 1978; Hardee et al.,
> 1978; Miller et al., 1979; Hardee et al., 1979), which collectively
> form one of the best model-testing opportunities of any extant
> dataset. The usefulness of the measured rainfall, runoff, and quality
> data is tremendously enhanced by the foresight of Miller (1979) in
> providing data needed for modeling for each of the four catchments.
>
> **The Catchment**
>
> The 14.7-ac HDR Catchment (Fig. 6--12) discharges to Snapper Creek
> (South Florida Water Management District Canal C-2) in south Miami,
> just southwest of the interchange of state highways 826 and 878. A
> watershed map used in SWMM5 is shown in Figure 6--12. Hardee et al.
> (1979) moni- tored 16 storms for rainfall, runoff, and water quality
> between May 1977 and June 1978. The apartment complex in 2011 is
> essentially the same as it was during the monitoring period, although
> cultural changes over 30 years would be expected to change runoff
> quality characteristics. The HDR catchment

> Cunning- ham and Huber (1987), Huber et al. (1991), Hamid (1995), and
> Lee and Heaney (2005). Catchment characteristics compiled by Miller
> (1979) are listed in Table 6--6, along with SWMM5 roughness,
> depression storage, and infiltration parameters and their basis.
>
> **Data Input and SWMM Calibration**
>
> Rainfall is converted into runoff in SWMM5 by the nonlinear reservoir
> method illustrated in Example 6--9; corresponding subcatchment input
> parameters are listed in Table 6--7, in addition to the global
> roughness, depression storage, and infiltration parameters listed in
> Table 6--6. The aver- age subcatchment slope could be found by
> selecting several points at the edge of the subcatchment, calculating
> the path length of each point to the subcatchment outlet, dividing the
> path lengths by the change in elevation, and taking an area-weighted
> average of the eight slopes. In this case, average slope was computed
> using an Arc/Info utility TIN (triangular irregular net- work) applied
> to a digitized map of the basin (Huber et al., 1991; see also Chapter
> 10). Percent imperviousness is DCIA (pavement, sidewalks) from
> Miller's (1979) data. An additional SWMM5 option would be to enter
> total imperviousness and then route the non-directly connected
> impervious runoff ("runon") over the adjacent pervious area (the
> remaining DCIA would drain directly to the subcatchment outlet). This
> refinement was not used for this example but would be especially
> useful in situations for which saturation of the pervious area is
> likely due to runon.

> Subcatchment width is a shape parameter, often used for calibration of
> peak flows. It can be estimated by determining the "average maximum"
> flow path length to the outlet, and dividing the area by this path
> length. The "average maximum" is the average of several flow path
> lengths from the outlet to the subcatchment boundary. This is the
> method used by Huber et al. (1991) to estimate widths for the HDR
> subcatchments. However, as per- haps more of an ambiguous input
> parameter than slope or roughness (nei- ther of which is necessarily
> straightforward to estimate), width is often used as the calibration
> parameter of choice for peak flows, since from Equation (6--20) it can
> be seen than any two of the three (width, slope, roughness) may be
> fixed and the third varied for calibration. Higher width usually means
> higher hydrograph peaks, because water runs off the subcatchment
> faster. However, in this modeling example, a priori input parameter
> estimates were sufficient to produce good calibration and verification
> simulations, and parameters were not varied beyond what is shown in
> Tables 6--6 and 6--7.

> Unfortunately, USGS regional flood frequency techniques (Chapter 3)
> cannot be applied to this small urban catchment in Miami because, as
> of 2011, no generalized equations are available for either the rural
> or urban areas of South Florida
> ([http://water.usgs.gov/software/nff.html).](http://water.usgs.gov/software/nff.html))
> However, the 5-yr rational method peak can be compared to the historic
> storms, and this section also serves to provide an additional rational
> method example. Chin (2004) provides a functional form of the IDF
> curves used in the Miami-Dade area:

where

> *i* = [308.5]{.underline} , (6--25) 48.6*T* ^-0.11^ + *t*(0.5895 + *T*
> ^-0.67^)

*i* = intensity (in./hr),

> *T* = return period (year), and
>
> *t* = rainfall duration (min).
>
> Interestingly, for a fixed *T*, Equation (6--25) is of the same form
> as Equation (6--10). The kinematic wave overland flow travel time
> \[Eq. (4--60)\] will be
>
> used in conjunction with assumed dynamic wave \[Eq. (6--7)\] travel
> times down the circular pipes shown in Figure 6--12. The longest
> travel time probably oc- curs from the combination of overland flow
> down subcatchments 207 and 208 toward inlets 7 and 8, plus the travel
> time down the four pipes from junction 8 to junction 1, neglecting the
> travel time down the outfall pipe, since that pipe typically has some
> standing water in it. From the SWMM5 input data, the four pipes
> connecting junctions 1 and 8 total 410 ft and all but one are 3 ft in
> diameter. The upper three pipes are corrugated metal pipe (CMP), with
> a Manning roughness of about 0.022 (Table 7--1), while the pipe
> connecting junctions 5 and 1 is reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), with a
> Manning roughness of about 0.013. Because the computations that follow
> are insensitive to most of the numbers used for the wave speed
> calculation, a simple average of 0.017 will be used for *n* instead of
> computation of a length-weighted harmonic mean or computation of wave
> speeds down the individual pipe segments. Invert elevations at
> junctions 8 and 1 are 2.262 and - 0.889 ft NGVD, respectively, giving
> an average slope of 0.00769. Assuming a 3-ft diameter pipe half full,
> Equation (6--7) gives a wave velocity of 6.16 ft/s and a corresponding
> dynamic
>
> wave travel time down the four pipes of 54 s ≈ 1 min.
>
> The dynamic wave travel time through the sewers will be added to the
>
> kinematic wave overland flow travel time. The latter is computed using
> an overland flow length of 500 ft (estimate for subcatchments 207 and
> 208 from Fig. 6--12), Manning roughness of 0.014 for the pavement
> (Table 6--6), and slope = 0.019 (SWMM input parameters for
> subcatchments 207 and 208). Iterations proceed as in Example 6--6,

> **Case Study Summary**
>
> The SWMM5 model was calibrated and verified for a high-density
> residen- tial apartment complex in Miami. Based on a continuous
> simulation, his- torical storm events were selected for prediction of
> peak flows and runoff volumes at desired return periods. A comparison
> was made with the 5-yr rational method peak, for which the results are
> highly sensitive to the choice of the runoff coefficient, *C*, but for
> which the rational method *Q*~peak~ was within the range of continuous
> simulation results using *C* = 0.5. The pri- mary advantage of the
> rational method and synthetic design storms is sim- plicity and ease
> of standardization by an agency. Advantages of continuous simulation
> using historical storms (Linsley and Crawford, 1974) include the
> following:

1.  Simulation using historical storms implies a frequency analysis of
    > peak flows (or runoff volumes), not a conditional frequency
    > analysis of rainfall depths. That is, the frequency analysis is on
    > the parameter of interest.

2.  The frequency analysis of the continuous time series of flows
    > includes all effects of antecedent conditions, whereas analysis of
    > the synthetic design storms does not.

3.  The historical storms avoid the vexing questions of storm duration,
    > shape, and hyetograph discretization. The duration is especially
    > critical, since peak flows may arise out of a storm that lasts a
    > few or several hours. There is simply no basis for establishing a
    > standard duration, such as 24 hr, for all design work, as seems to
    > be the unfor- tunate tendency in many urban areas.

4.  Historical storms can also be used for analysis of volumes for
    > design of basins for detention or retention. The volume of
    > synthetic storms is arbitrarily linked to the assumed rainfall
    > duration. A given volume can result from infinitely many
    > combinations of intensity and dura- tion, with a corresponding
    > range of return periods.

5.  If historical storms, rather than "unreal" synthetic storms, are
    > used for design, local citizens can be confident that the design
    > will withstand a real storm that they may remember for its
    > flooding. Thus, the engineers or agency can make a statement such
    > as, "Our design will avoid the flooding that resulted from the
    > storm of August 20, 1972."

6.  BMP design may be performed with more accurate knowledge of the
    > relationship between the magnitude of inflow rate or device volume
    > and the percentage of annual runoff volume controlled by the BMP.

> **SUMMARY**
>
> A wealth of analytical options exists for application to quantity
> problems in urban hydrology. These range from the simple calculations
> of the rational method (properly applied) to sophisticated computer
> models. However, only the latter option permits the use of continuous
> simulation, which avoids knotty problems of antecedent con- ditions
> and assignment of frequency to hydrographs that are inherent in the
> use of IDF curves and synthetic design storms. Regardless of whether
> an operational model is used for analysis of urban runoff, the same
> hydrologic tasks as in nonurban areas must be performed. These tasks
> include collection and analysis of rainfall data, com- putation of
> losses, conversion of rainfall excess to runoff by any of several
> methods, and flow routing down the drainage system. Although many of
> the analytical meth- ods that are applied to nonurban areas may also
> be applied to computation of urban runoff, urban areas present special
> problems associated with high imperviousness, fast response times, and
> complex hydraulic phenomena in the sewer system. New methods and
> models are continually revealed; the readers should maintain contact
> with the hydrologic literature to stay abreast of new developments in
> a field subject to rapid change.

> **PROBLEMS**

1.  Land use and population density data are given for several cities in
    the accompanying table. Estimate the percent imperviousness for each
    city us- ing two methods: (1) imperviousness as a function of
    population density and (2) weighted imperviousness as a function of
    land use. Assume that undeveloped land is the same as "open" in
    Table 6--2, and "other" is 50% institutional and 50% open. (Data
    sources: Heaney et al., 1977; Sullivan et al., 1978.)

2.  A small, 2-ha, mostly impervious urban catchment has an average
    slope of 1.5% and the following average Horton infiltration
    parameters: *f*~0~ = 4 mm/hr, *f~c~* = 1 mm/hr, *k* = 2.2 hr^-1^
    (infiltration occurs through cracks in the paving). Consider the
    rainfall hyetograph in Figure P6--2.

    a.  Determine the depression storage using Figure 6--3.

    b.  Determine the time of beginning of runoff.

    c.  Calculate and sketch the hyetograph of rainfall excess. Use the

9.  The subdivision of Problem 6.8 drains to the upstream end of a
    circular pipe that has an *n* value of 0.013 and a slope of 0.006
    ft/ft. Determine the size of pipe needed to carry the flow from the
    5-yr storm. (*Note:* Standard diameters in the United States start
    at 12 in. and increase in 6-in. increments to 60 in., then continue
    to increase in 12-in. increments.)

10. A 14.7-ac multifamily residential catchment in Miami has a total
    impervious area of 10.4 ac, but it has a hydraulically effective
    impervious area of only 6.48 ac. The pervious portions of the basin
    consist of lawns over a Perrine marl, with a very slow infiltration
    rate. Rainfall and runoff data monitored by the USGS (Hardee et
    al., 1979) are reported in Table 6--9 for 16 storm events.

    a.  Determine a linear relationship between runoff and rainfall
        > using linear regression analysis (least squares). Test the
        > significance of the regression, and plot the data points and
        > the fitted line.

    b.  What is the value of depression storage for this basin?

11. Using the data of Problem 6.10, determine the average runoff
    coefficient by

    a.  computing the runoff coefficient for each storm and finding the
        average;

    b.  dividing the total runoff for all storms by the total rainfall
        for all storms;

    c.  finding the slope of a runoff-vs.-rainfall regression line that
        > is "forced" through the origin.

> Discuss the computed runoff coefficients in relation to the values of
> impervi- ousness and hydraulically effective imperviousness.

12. A detention pond has the shape of an inverted truncated pyramid,
    > shown in Figure P6--12(a). It has a rectangular bottom of
    > dimension 120 \* 80 ft, a maxi- mum depth of 5 ft, and uniform
    > side slopes of 3:1 (horizontal:vertical). Hence the dimensions at
    > 5-ft depth are also rectangular, with length 150 ft and width 110
    > ft. The outlet from the basin behaves as an orifice, with a
    > diameter of 1 ft and a discharge coefficient of 0.9. The opening
    > of the orifice (a pipe draining from the center of the basin) is
    > effectively at a depth of zero (i.e., at the bottom of the pond).
    > (The pond floor would typically slope toward the outlet, but this
    > slope will be ignored in this problem. In addition, the orifice
    > will be assumed to follow its theoretical behavior even at very
    > small depths.)

    a.  What is the total volume of the pond, in ft^3^ and ac-ft?

    b.  Develop the depth-vs.-surface-area and depth-vs.-volume curves
        > for the pond. Use 1-ft intervals. Tabulate and plot.

13. Use the USGS regression equation \[Eq. (3--82)\] to compute the 5-yr
    peak flow for a 4-ac Tallahassee catchment that is 95% impervious.
    Compare your answer with the value computed in Example 6--6. The
    reason for the large discrepancy is that the regression equations
    were developed for much larger catchments (the smallest being 0.21
    mi^2^) and probably do not apply to a 4-ac catchment.

    1.  A 9.6-acre low-density residential site in Anchorage, Alaska,
        was monitored by the USGS during a study of the hydrology and
        water quality characteristics of the area (Brabets, 1987). Data
        for rainfall depth, runoff depth, and suspended solids, SS (in
        units of lb and lb/ac-in.) are given in the table. These data
        are for discrete rainfall events. Note that pounds per acre-inch
        has units of mass/ volume and is a concentration, whereas pounds
        of SS are a load (mass) and calculated by multiplying
        concentration *x* volume of runoff. (Appropriate con- version
        factors are included, of course.)

    > the table (i.e., that 53.8 lb/ac-in. with a runoff of 0.024 in.
    > results in 12.4 lb of SS).

b.  Rainfall is to be considered as an explanatory variable (independent
    > vari- able) for the prediction of runoff, SS (lb), and SS
    > (lb/ac-in.). Perform the three indicated linear regressions. Test
    > the significance of the regressions at the 95% level (alpha = 5%).
    > Plot the data points for runoff vs. rainfall on one graph and for
    > both SS values vs. rainfall on one or two other graphs. If the

3.  A planned subdivision near Tallahassee can be represented
    > conceptually as shown in Figure P6--20.

> The inner rectangle represents DCIA, consisting of rooftops, streets,

> rectangle are 1000 ft wide by 2500 ft tall. The pervious area behaves

> values of runoff coefficients should be used.
>
> The inlet time for flow from the far upper end of the catchment (e.g.,
> an upper corner of the pervious area) is 2 hr. The inlet time just for
> the DCIA is 20 min.

(a) What is the 25-yr outflow, by the rational method? Remember to
    > compute runoff both for the total area and for just the DCIA.

(b) Use the USGS regression equations for Tallahassee \[Eq. (3--82)\]
    > and com- pute the 25-yr peak flow. Observe that this value is
    > close to the rational method estimate for DCIA, from part (a).

(c) A corrugated metal pipe (CMP) culvert (*n* = 0.024) will receive the
    > 25-yr flow from the catchment, using the rational method of part
    > (a). If the pipe slope is 1%, what standard U.S. diameter (see
    > Problem 6.9) should be used?

    1.  A subdivision in Corvallis, Oregon, is shown in Figure P6--21.
        Rational method design is performed using the 10-yr return
        period IDF curve of the Oregon Department of
        Transportation (2005) for Zone 8, which may be approximated as
        follows:

> *i* = 0.2081 + [29.8438]{.underline} - [184.51]{.underline} +
> [432.8875]{.underline},

> with *i* in in./hr and *t~r~* in minutes. The standard error of

(a) Estimate the peak flow at the outlet from the "curved end portion"
    > of Sitka Place, roughly where a line on the asphalt pavement would
    > connect houses 3 and 8, as shown by the arrow on the figure.
    > Follow these steps and guidelines:

    -   You must construct an estimate of the tributary area.

    -   The impervious areas of houses 4, 5, 6, and 7 contribute runoff
        > to flow at the upper end of the street, but none of the other
        > houses do. Thus,

> ![](./images/media/image310.png)**Figure P6--21**

> Subdivision for Problem 6.21, with 10-ft contours. All impervious area
> is directly connected to the drainage system. To set a scale, the
> distance between the upper left corner of house 4 and lower right
> corner of house 10 is 381 ft. The outside dimensions of the whole
> figure are approximately 708 ft by 1104 ft.
>
> you can assume that the downhill edges of houses 4 and 7 and the
> downstream edge of their driveways define the lower boundary of the
> basin (apart from the pavement of the cul-de-sac).

-   Work uphill from these lower boundaries toward the high point on the
    > hill to define the tributary area, keeping in mind that the
    > boundary

> should be perpendicular to the contours. This will define a
> "teardrop"- shaped catchment.

-   Estimate the area using a planimeter or by counting squares.
    > Estimate an average slope by dividing the difference in upper and
    > lower eleva- tions by an estimated path length.

-   The undeveloped area above the end of the street behaves like a lawn
    > on "heavy soil." Overland flow roughness for this surface could be
    > char- acterized as for "dense shrubbery and forest litter."

-   Use the kinematic wave method to estimate *t~c~* and hence the peak
    > flow. Assume that the travel time over the impervious area is much
    > less than the travel time over the pervious area. Thus, base
    > kinematic wave pa- rameter a only on the pervious area
    > characteristics. Do not compute a weighted Manning's roughness.

-   The limit for the intensity-vs.-duration equation is 3 ... *t~r~*
    > ... 400 min- utes. Stop computation at 3 minutes if indicated.

(b) All the impervious area (rooftops, driveways, streets) is directly
    > con- nected. Hence, compute a second estimate of peak flow based
    > only on the DCIA. Which estimate governs?

(c) The AutoCAD map of Figure P6--21 was prepared in 1991. But in the
    > year 2007, the hill above Sitka Place was completely developed
    > with new houses! What does this imply about hydrologic design for
    > areas such as this?

    1.  The Santa Barbara Urban Hydrograph Method (SBUHM) consists of
        two basic computational steps:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(1) Compute rainfall excesses for each rainfall time step. Rainfall
    > excesses (depth/time) from the pervious and impervious areas are
    > multiplied by their respective areas and summed to obtain one flow
    > value per time step for the entire catchment (the "instantaneous
    > hydrograph"). Any conven- ient means may be used to compute
    > rainfall excess, ranging from very simple runoff coefficients with
    > depression storage \[Eq. (6--11)\], to SCS curve numbers (Chapter
    > 2), to the infiltration equations of Chapter 2. In this method,
    > DCIA is often assumed to have no losses.

(2) The resulting instantaneous hydrograph is then routed through an
    > imagi- nary linear reservoir to provide delay and attenuation. The
    > linear reservoir has a time constant *K* = *t~c~* for the
    > catchment. Routing is performed using the Muskingum method
    > equations (Section 4.2), with Muskingum param- eter *x* = 0 (for a
    > linear reservoir) and Δ*t* = time step of instantaneous
    > hydrograph.

> Use the data from Problem 6.15 to perform SBUHM routing. Assume that
> the rainfall excess applies to the entire catchment area (so for this
> problem, there is no merging of runoff from pervious area and DCIA).

a.  Compute the instantaneous hydrograph at 30-min intervals, in units
    > of cfs ≈ ac@in./hr.

b.  Inferring a value for the time of concentration for the overall
    > catchment from the given time--area data, compute Muskingum
    > coefficients *C*~0~, *C*~1~, and *C*~2~, with Muskingum *K* =
    > *t~c~* and *x* = 0 for the linear reservoir.

c.  Perform the indicated flow routing through the hypothetical
    > reservoir. Plot the inflow "instantaneous hydrograph" and outflow
    > hydrograph on the same graph. Remember that the hydrographs begin
    > with zero flow.

d.  If you have worked Problem 6.15, compare the hydrographs by the two
    > methods.

> This chapter on **open-channel flow** is limited to coverage of
> steady-flow problems, such as **uniform flow** and **nonuniform
> flow**. Unsteady channel flow hydraulics is beyond the scope of this
> text but is available in more advanced fluid mechanics references.
> Channel and floodplain computations of **water surface profiles** are
> critical to defining levels of flood inundation and are normally
> treated as steady-flow problems.
>
> Uniform open-channel flow is the hydraulic condition in which the
> water depth and the channel cross section do not change over some
> reach of the channel. These criteria require that the energy grade
> line, water surface, and channel bottom are all parallel. In other
> words, the total energy change over the channel reach is exactly equal
> to the energy losses of boundary fric- tion and turbulence.
>
> Uniform flow is eventually established over any long channel reach
> that has constant flow and an unchanging channel cross section. Strict
> uni- form flow is rare in natural streams because of the constantly
> changing chan- nel conditions. But it is often assumed in natural
> streams for engineering calculations, with the understanding that the
> results are general approxima- tions of the actual hydraulic
> conditions. Uniform flow assumptions should not be made in cases where
> a well-defined and consistent channel does not exist and where rapidly
> varying flow is caused by changes in the channel. Man-made channels
> are usually very consistent, and uniform flow calcula- tions are much
> more exact for them.

> Two uniform flow equations are frequently used for open-channel flow
> problems: the Chezy formula and Manning's equation, which relate the
> fol- lowing variables:
>
> *A* = cross-sectional area of channel,
>
> *V* = channel velocity,
>
> *P* = the wetted perimeter of the channel,
>
> *R* = hydraulic radius, or cross-sectional area *A* divided by the
> wetted perimeter *P*,
>
> *S* = energy slope, which is equal to the slope of the channel bed
> under the uniform flow assumptions,
>
> *C* or *n* = roughness coefficient, related to the friction loss
> associated with water flowing over the bottom and sides of the
> channel.
>
> The Chezy formula was developed in 1775; it relates channel velocity
> to roughness, hydraulic radius, and channel slope:
>
> *V* = *C* 1*RS*. (7--1)
>
> The *C* factor can be related to Darcy's friction factor *f*, used in
> pipe flow, with the relationship
>
> *C* = 18*g*\>*f*, (7--2)
>
> where *g* is the gravitational constant.
>
> The Chezy equation is based on two main assumptions: the frictional
> force is proportional to the square of the velocity, and the uniform
> flow assumption that the gravity force is balanced by the frictional
> resistance of the stream. The Chezy equation has been used for
> pressure pipe flow as well as open channel flow. The Chezy *C*
> coefficient for open channel conditions can be calculated using
> relationships from Chow (1959).
>
> For most present applications, however, Manning's equation is used
> instead of the Chezy formula for open-channel computations. Manning's
> equa- tion was presented in 1890; it describes roughness with the
> Manning's rough- ness coefficient *n*:
>
> *V* = [1]{.underline} *R*^2\>3^1*S*. (7--3)
>
> The roughness coefficients were originally developed in the metric
> system (m and s), and a conversion coefficient must be used to apply
> Manning's equation with U.S. customary units:
>
> *V* = [1.49]{.underline} *R*^2\>3^1*S*. (7--4)
>
> The conversion coefficient 1.49 is the cube root of 3.28, which
> converts m to ft. A dimensional analysis of *n* shows units of
> *TL*^-1\>3^ and illustrates a theoretical problem with Manning's
> equation. The empirical nature of the relationship does not restrict
> its usefulness, however, and it is widely used to solve numerous types
> of open-channel flow problems.
>
> The selection of the roughness coefficient *n* is usually based on
> "best
>
> engineering judgment" or on values prescribed by municipal design
> ordinances. Several tables are available in the general literature for
> the selec- tion of Manning's roughness coefficient for a particular
> open channel (see Table 7--1 or Chow, 1959).

> **SPECIFIC ENERGY AND CRITICAL**

**FLOW**

> **Specific energy** is a case of **total energy** that can be defined
> for any location along an open channel. The total energy can be
> defined as the sum of the pressure head, the elevation head, and the
> velocity head for any cross sec- tion. In its simplest form, the
> energy equation becomes

*p*

*H* = g + *z* +

> *V*2 , (7--5)
>
> 2*g*
>
> where g = r*g* and *y* = *p*\>g = depth. Specific energy *E* at a
> single section is referenced to the channel bed and therefore is a sum
> of depth *y* and **velocity head** *V*^2^ 2*g*:

*E* = *y* +

*Q*2

> *E* = *y* + 2*gA*2 . (7--7)
>
> For simplicity, the following discussion is limited to a wide

> Figure 7--3 shows the variation of depth as a function of *E* for a
> given flow rate. It can be seen that for a given flow rate and
> specific energy, there are two possible values of depth *y*, called
> alternate depths. The curve for constant *q* gives a curve of depth
> values and the corresponding values of
>
> *E.* As *q* increases, the curves are shifted to the right. For each

> provide addi- tional information for classifying open-channel flows.
> On the upper limb of the curve, the flow is said to be tranquil, while
> on the lower limb it is called rapid flow. The velocity and flow rate
> occurring at the critical depth are termed *V~c~* and *q~c~*, the
> critical velocity and critical flow, respectively. The velocity of the

> velocity, and the velocity of the lower limb flow is faster than
> critical and is called **supercritical** velocity.
>
> The Froude number is used to characterize open-channel flow, and Fr 6
> 1 occurs for subcritical flow and Fr 7 1 for supercritical flow. From
> Equation (7--11) a condition of subcritical or supercritical flow may
> be easily tested by comparing the velocity head *V*^2^ 2*g* to the
> value of *y* 2. For any value of *E* there exists a critical depth for
> which the flow is a maximum. For any value of *q* there exists a
> critical depth for which specific energy is a minimum. For any flow
> condition other than critical, there exists an alternate depth at
> which the same rate of discharge is carried by the same specific
> energy. Alternate depth can be found by solving Equation (7--8).

> The condition of critical flow just defined is used to define channel
> slope. If, for a given roughness and shape, the channel slope is such
> that the uniform flow is subcritical, slope is said to be **mild** and
> *y* 7 *y~c~*. If the uniform flow is supercritical, the slope is
> termed **steep** and *y* 6 *y~c~*. A **critical slope** *S~c~* is the
> slope that will just sustain a given rate of discharge in a uniform

> When flow changes from subcritical to supercritical or vice versa, the

> depth implies a unique relationship between *y* and *V* or *Q.* This
> condition can occur only at a **control section**. In the transition
> from supercritical to subcritical flow, a **hydraulic jump** will
> occur, as described in Section 7.8. By measuring the depth at a
> control sec- tion, we can compute a value of *Q* for a channel based
> on critical flow equations. Critical depth occurs when flow passes
> over a weir or a free outfall with subcritical flow in the channel
> prior to the control section. Critical depth may also occur in a
> channel if the bottom is suddenly elevated or if the sidewalls are
> moved in by contraction. In fact, flumes are designed so as to force

> In an open channel or natural stream the effect of a grade or slope
> tends to produce a flow with a continually increasing velocity along

> the flow is nonuniform, and is called **gradually varied flow** if
> changing conditions occur over a long distance. **Rapidly varied
> flow** occurs when there is an abrupt change or transition confined to
> a short distance. Rapid flow is covered in more advanced texts that
> address fluid mechanics and open channel flow (Chow, 1959; Wylie and
> Streeter, 1978).
>
> Gradually varied flow can occur along the profile of a channel or
> natural stream, at changes in cross-sectional shape or size, at bends
> in the stream, and at structures such as dams, bridges, or weirs. Of
> particular interest in watershed analysis and floodplain hydraulics is
> the case of the natural stream and the impact associated with bridge
> or culvert crossings, especially in urban areas. This represents one
> of the most complex applica- tions of nonuniform flow theory, and
> computer models have been written to handle all of the necessary
> computations. An example of a very popular flood profile model is the
> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers HEC-2 model (Hydrologic Engineering
> Center, 1982, 1990), which is described in detail later in this
> chapter (Sections 7.9 to 7.14). HEC-2 is described in more detail in
> Hoggan (1997) and in the user's manual (HEC, 1990). The new version of

>
> The *H*2 and *H*3 profiles correspond to the *M*2 and *M*3 curves for

> complex channel reaches, since flow cannot continue indefinitely on a
> horizontal bed.
>
> The adverse slope, *S*~0~ 6 0, occurs where flows sometimes move
> against gravity; as in the case of horizontal slopes, the adverse
> slope can occur only for a short section in a more complex channel
> system. In some natural channel systems, there are occasional reaches
> where these conditions can and do occur.
>
> The hydraulic jump is covered in detail in most fluid mechanics
> textbooks (Daugherty et al., 1985; Fox and McDonald, 1985). The
> transition from supercritical to subcritical flow produces a marked
> discontinuity in the sur- face, characterized by a steep upward slope
> of the profile and a significant loss of energy through turbulence.
> The hydraulic jump can best be explained by reference to the *M*3
> curve of Table 7--2 and Figure 7--8, downstream of a sluice gate. The
> flow decelerates because the mild slope is not great enough to
> maintain constant supercritical flow, and the specific energy *E*
> decreases as the depth increases. When downstream conditions require a
> change to subcritical flow, the need for the change cannot be
> telegraphed upstream. Theory calls for a vertical slope of the water
> surface. Therefore, a hydraulic jump occurs and flow changes from
> supercritical to subcritical conditions.
>
> When flow at a section is supercritical and downstream conditions
> require a change to subcritical flow, the abrupt change in depth
> involves a significant energy loss through turbulent mixing. A jump
> will form when slope changes from steep to mild, as on the apron at
> the base of a spillway. In fact, stilling basins below spillways are
> designed to dissipate the damaging energy of supercritical velocities,
> and downstream erosion is held in check. An equation can be derived
> for horizontal or very mild slopes to relate depth before and after

> **INTRODUCTION TO THE HEC-RAS**

**MODEL**

> The HEC-2 model was originally developed in the 1970s by the
> Hydrologic Engineering Center (1982) of the U.S. ACOE. The program was
> updated to HEC-RAS in 1995 with an easy-to-use graphical user
> interface (GUI). The program is designed to calculate water surface
> profiles for steady, gradually varied flow in natural or man-made
> channels. The computational procedure is based on solution of the
> one-dimensional energy equation \[Eq. (7--16)\] using the standard
> step method. The program can be applied to floodplain manage- ment and
> flood insurance studies to evaluate **floodway encroachments** and to
> delineate **flood hazard** zones. The model can also be used to
> evaluate effects on water surface profiles of channel improvements and

The coefficient of discharge *C* varies according to the configuration
of the bridge and the roadway and is reduced in HEC-RAS model whenever
the weir or bridge is submerged by high tailwater. Typically, discharge
coeffi- cient value *C* ranges from 2.5 to 3.1 for broad-crested weirs
when no tailwa- ter effect occurs. For high tailwater elevation, HEC-RAS
is able to automatically reduce the amount of weir flow to account for
the submer- gence on the weir. Submergence is defined as a ratio of the
water depth above the minimum weir elevation on the downstream side
divided by the height of the energy gradeline above the minimum weir
elevation on the upstream side. When the weir is highly submerged,
HEC-RAS program automatically switches to calculating the upstream water
surface by the energy equation instead of using the pressure and weir
flow equation. The user can set up the criteria for when to switch to
energy-based computations.

> **Cross-Section Layout for Bridge Modeling**
>
> Figure 7--12 illustrates the cross-section requirements for bridge
> modeling. In order to perform computation properly, HEC-RAS program
> requires four key cross sections: (1) one cross section downstream of
> the bridge where flow is not affected by the bridge, (2) one just
> downstream of the bridge, (3) one just upstream of the bridge, and (4)
> one cross section located far enough upstream to be out of the
> backwater influence. Based on these four chosen cross sections,
> HEC-RAS program automatically adds two more cross sections immediately
> inside the upstream and downstream bridge faces. Thus, in HEC-RAS,
> bridge modeling is usually performed with a total of six cross
> sections, with four sec- tions provided by the user and two more
> developed by the program.
>
> The spacing of cross sections downstream of the bridge should be based

> **Effective flow area** is that portion of the total cross-sectional

>
> The ineffective flow area may be eliminated from consideration by
> defining the top of road and low chord profiles of a bridge. The
> ineffective area option in HEC-RAS may be used to "block out" portions
> of the chan- nel cross section that are not effective in conveying
> flow downstream. For example, all flow can be restricted to a channel
> cross section until the com- puted water surface elevation exceeds the
> elevation of one or both channel banks. Encroachment stations for a

> After the HEC-RAS program is executed for a stream reach, a detailed
> output for each profile appears. Summary tables provide the basic
> informa- tion to define water surface elevation (WSEL), channel
> velocity (VCH), area, flow rate (*Q*), top width, and a host of other
> variables that could be requested. HEC-RAS could also be used to
> evaluate

1.  effects of altered (increased or decreased) peak flows from urban
    > development or reservoir storage,

2.  effects of additional bridge crossings or altered bridge openings,

3.  effects of altering roughness coefficients or channel sizes, and

4.  effects of changing the starting water surface elevation downstream
    > (i.e., at the confluence with a larger stream).

> Finally, HEC-RAS can be used to generate a series of water surface
> eleva- tions and the corresponding flows to generate a
> storage--discharge relation for HEC-HMS flood routing. Thus, HEC-HMS
> and HEC-RAS together provide powerful computer tools for hydrologic
> analysis and design. More details can be found in Hoggan (1997) and
> the HEC user manuals, and a detailed example is provided at the end of
> this chapter.

> **HEC-RAS FEATURES**
>
> The impetus behind the creation of HEC-RAS was the desire to use the
> com- putational power of HEC-2 but present it in a very easy-to-use
> format. Several other improvements have been made. HEC-RAS is able to
> operate with mixed regime conditions, provided the proper boundary
> conditions are input into the program. HEC-RAS also includes the
> ability to model inline weirs and gates and multiple culvert openings,
> and has a new method for handling piers on bridges. The discussion of
> HEC-RAS that follows is designed to give the student a basic overview
> of the program and an appreciation for its strength as a hydraulic
> modeling tool. Its flexibility has been enhanced as its data are used
> in conjunction with other programs, as seen later in the chapter. For
> a more complete presentation of the program details, please refer to
> the HEC- RAS user's manual, which is downloadable, along with HEC-RAS
> itself, from the U.S. ACOE website at
> [www.hec.usace.army.mil.](http://www.hec.usace.army.mil/) In order to
> better intro- duce HEC-RAS, a model set up will be shown from a
> project on Big Creek, Texas, a creek that flows about 25 miles
> southwest of Houston.
>
> **Creating a Project**
>
> HEC-RAS divides the necessary input into two categories: geometric
> data and flow data. Both can be accessed through the Edit menu in the
> main program window or by clicking on one of the shortcut buttons in
> the same window. Doing so takes the user into either the Geometric
> Data Editor or the Steady Flow Editor. Each project has a main project
> file, which contains a list of all supporting files associated with
> that project, including geometry, flow, plan, and output files. A
> project can hold many different geometry and flow files and each
> combination of geometry and flow files that creates a plan file.
> Finally, the result of each run is then stored as an output file.
>
> **Geometric Data**
>
> The Geometric Data Editor window is where all physical and
> topographical data are input. The first step in creating a model is to
> click on a button on the left side of the window labeled **River
> Reach**. The user is then able to click the mouse in the viewing area
> and draw the river reach. The drawing in the window has no effect on
> the program computationally, so it does not need to be an accurate
> visual representation of what the reach looks like.
>
> Once the reach is drawn, the cross sections can be entered. As cross
> sec- tions are created, they are automatically placed on the drawing
> of the river reach. Clicking on the **Cross Section** button on the
> left of the Geometric Data Editor brings up the Cross Section Data
> window. To create a new cross section,
>
> click on **Add a new Cross Section** in the Options menu. The program
> will prompt the user for the river station number. After the number is
> entered, one can input data for the cross section into the program.
> HEC-RAS requires a variety of data types. This window is where points
> along the cross section and their elevations are assigned. Distances
> to the next downstream cross section are needed along the left
> overbank (LOB), the channel, and the right overbank (ROB). Channel
> bank stations as well as contraction and expansion coefficients are
> also necessary. Note that the cross sections are shown from the
> perspective of the user looking downstream standing in the middle of
> the cross section.
>
> ![](./images/media/image338.png){width="4.499749562554681in"
> height="4.525249343832021in"}The Manning *n* values can be entered in
> one of two different ways (see Table 7--1 for values). If there is no
> variation in the *n* value within a portion of the cross section, such
> as the ROB, then the *n* values can be directly entered into the
> existing fields. If there is variation in *n* values within a part of
> the cross section, choosing **Horizontal Variation in *n* Values**
> from the Options menu creates a new column next to the cross-sectional
> elevation field. Values in this column must be entered only when there
> is a change in *n*-values going from left to right across the cross
> section. Figure 7--16 shows an example of a completed Cross Section
> data input window.

>
> Other important options are accessed from the Cross Section Data win-
> dow. Areas of ineffective flow as well as levees and blocked
> obstructions are defined from the Options menu. Areas of ineffective
> flow are areas in which flow is hampered. Examples of ineffective flow
> are often seen on the sides of the channel just next to bridges, where
> the water is rapidly contracting or expanding (see Fig. 7--15).
> Clicking on **Plot Cross Section** in the Plot menu brings up a plot
> of the cross section (Fig. 7--17). This is a good way to check if all
> the points are entered correctly and is another advantage of HEC-RAS
> compared to the original HEC-2. HEC-RAS cross-section data can be
> checked by simply clicking through the cross-section plots on the
> screen, using up and down arrows. The zoom feature is particularly
> useful to study specific details.
>
> Bridges in HEC-RAS require four cross sections: two just a few feet
> away from each face of the bridge, one far enough upstream that flow
> has not yet begun to contract, and one far enough downstream that flow
> has completely expanded (Fig. 7--14). These cross sections are created
> just as any others, and clicking on the **Brdg/Culv** button in the
> Geometric Data Editor opens the Bridge Culvert Data window. From this
> window both bridges and culverts can be cre- ated. Click on Options
> and select **Add a Bridge and/or Culvert** to begin the process of
> creating the bridge. Defining a bridge's deck or roadway is very simi-
> lar to defining the elevations and points along a cross section and
> can be done in the **Deck/Roadway** editor. The only difference is
> that two elevations must be
>
> defined: the top chord and the low chord, which must be entered for
> both the upstream and downstream faces of the bridge (Fig. 7--13).
> These values are often the same for the two faces, so HEC-RAS provides
> a copy up-to-down button that simply copies the chord elevation data
> from one face to the other. A detailed analysis of the culvert program
> within HEC-RAS is contained in Section 9.3.
>
> HEC-RAS allows the user to input individual bridge piers and to define
> the height and width of each pier, which in turn allows for pier
> widths that vary with elevation. Piers are defined in their own
> window, labeled **Pier** in the **Bridge Culvert Data** window. The
> **Pier** window is used for defining the size and location of the
> piers. A third window can be used to input sloping abutments. Finally,
> a fourth window allows the user to determine the method that HEC- RAS
> uses in calculating losses through the bridge. An option is even
> included for HEC-RAS to use the calculation method that results in the
> highest energy loss, which is a useful option that results in a more
> conservative model than if a single approach were used. Figure 7--18
> shows a typical bridge section in HEC-RAS, and the zoom feature can be
> used to see more details.

>
> **Flow Data**
>
> The second major category of input data in HEC-RAS is flow data. HEC-
> RAS requires the user to select the reach and all the cross sections
> where a change in flow occurs. Once a flow is selected for a cross
> section, that flow is used on all cross sections upstream of the first
> until the program encoun- ters a different flow. HEC-RAS also
> maintains the ability to model multiple profiles simultaneously. This
> allows the user to easily compare, for example, the 10-yr, 25-yr,
> 50-yr, and 100-yr floods on one graph. As mentioned before, the Steady
> Flow Data Editor is accessed by clicking **Edit** in the main pro-
> gram window, and then clicking **Steady Flow Data**. The flow data
> that are used are often generated by HEC-HMS and can be imported into
> HEC- RAS. This iteration between RAS and HMS can be used to compute
> and refine storage--outflow relationships that normally are used for
> flood routing in HMS (see Fig. 5--5).
>
> The Steady Flow Data Editor has one other job of major importance, and
> that is setting the boundary conditions for the reach. A boundary
> condi- tion must be selected for each profile, and one must keep in
> mind whether the flow is subcritical, supercritical, or mixed regime
> flow, as this determines whether to use downstream, upstream, or both
> boundary conditions. It should be noted that for floodplain analysis,
> downstream boundary condi- tions are generally used most often. Four
> types of boundary conditions can be used: known water surfaces,
> critical depth, normal depth, and given rating curves. Only one
> condition needs to be defined.
>
> **Running and Viewing Results**
>
> Once all geometric data, flow data, and boundary conditions have been
> entered, HEC-RAS can run the simulation. Click on **Run** and then
> **Steady Flow Analysis** in the main program window. This brings up a
> new win- dow. If the user has several flow or geometry files, he/she
> can then choose which set of files to run. Each combination of
> geometry and flow files is stored as a separate plan, which can be
> given a unique name. Each time a new plan is computed, an output file
> is generated and saved with the results.
>
> Results of HEC-RAS are useful in their ability to create various plots
> and tables of the output results. The displayed data are easily chosen
> from a menu so that the user is able to customize the data that are of
> interest. The cross-section output table lists a number of variables
> and associated values computed for each particular cross section. A
> typical cross-section output table is shown in Figure 7--19. All of
> the plots and tables that will be dis- cussed in this section can be
> found by clicking on the **View** menu in the main program window.
>
> A cross-section plot is one of the plots that are available (see Fig.
> 7--17 or 7--18). It plots any cross section in the reach and displays
> the water surfaces from as many or as few of the flow profiles as the
> user chooses.

> Cross-section output table.
>
> It can also display the energy grade lines and the critical depth,
> along with numerous other options. Other cross sections can be easily
> viewed by click- ing on the arrow keys above the window. The water
> surface profile plot is another plot that displays the water surface
> and energy grade lines as a profile that runs lengthwise down the
> center of the channel (Fig. 7--20a). This plot can also graph the bank
> as well as the bridge stations on either side of the channel. This is
> a useful feature in that it shows not only where the water is
> overtopping the banks and bridges, but also by how much.
>
> Another useful tool is the X-Y-Z perspective plot. Figure 7--20b shows
> the reach in three dimensions; the user may rotate the image about two
> axes. There is also a zoom-in command to allow the user to study a
> particular segment in more detail. This gives the user an easy way to
> see the relative extent that the floodwaters have traveled outside the
> bank and the relative slope change as one moves downstream along the
> profile. This plot can also display multiple profiles at once, making
> it easy to com- pare floods of different magnitude. This capability is
> a great improvement over HEC-2, allowing the user to visualize the
> floodplain in three-dimen- sional perspective.
>
> Other options that exist in the View menu include the ability to
> create rating curves for any cross section, and tables that provide a
> vast array of calculated properties for each cross section and
> profile. A powerful feature

> of all graphs and tables in HEC-RAS is the ability to customize the
> output. The user has great freedom in choosing which variables to
> display in a given form of output. Also, HEC-RAS, in the File menu of
> the main program window, can generate a report. Here as well, the user
> specifies what sort of information goes in the report. This is an
> important feature because other programs can use generated reports as
> input files, as described in a later section.
>
> **Channel Modification**
>
> Thus far, all the tools necessary to create and examine a stream or
> channel have been introduced. However, the job of the engineer is not
> always just to model the flooding, but to find ways to alleviate it.
> In a typical hydraulic analysis, this may involve making improvements
> to the channel in the form of deepening or widening a section. HEC-RAS
> has a window called **Channel Modification** that makes improving the
> channel a very simple process. The Channel Modification window can be
> found in the Tools menu in the Geo- metric Data Editor. The improved
> channel is referred to as the cut. Channel modification entails
> telling the model what range of cross sections will be widened and
> what the bottom width, side slope, and *n* values of the cut will
> become, along with a few other specifications.
>
> The user begins by entering data into a part of the window entitled
> **Set Range of Values**. The range of cross sections to be modified is
> entered first, then the other properties of the cut. The Channel
> Modification window allows the invert elevations to be set in a number
> of ways. The elevations can remain the same, they can be set to a
> constant elevation, or a slope can be extended upstream from the
> downstream endpoint or downstream from the upstream endpoint. When the
> **Set Range of Values** portion of the win- dow is completed, the
> **Apply Cuts to Selected Range** button is clicked. A table containing
> data from all the cross sections in the reach, not just the ones being
> modified, can be found at the bottom of the Channel Modifica- tion
> window. Once the cuts have been applied, the updated data appear in
> this table of cross sections. From here the user can make
> modifications to individual cross sections. Also, if the new channel
> does not run along the centerline of the existing channel, the center
> station must be entered in this table. Finally, the **Compute Cuts**
> button is pressed to update all the changes. A useful feature is the
> **Cut and Fill Areas** button. Pressing this button pro- duces a
> report in tabular form that shows all of the calculated volumes of
> soil that must be excavated for the proposed channel, which is a good
> way to estimate the cost of the project. The modified channel can then
> be saved as a new geometry file and processed in the simulation.
>
> **Unsteady Flow Simulation**
>
> Version 3.0 of HEC-RAS allows, for the first time, for the unsteady
> flow analysis within a floodplain, and the user can actually view the
> change of
>
> depth as a function of both space and time. The Unsteady NETwork
> simula- tor (UNET) was modified for HEC-RAS in order to simulate
> one-dimen- sional unsteady flow through a full network of open
> channels. In addition to solving the network system, UNET provides the
> user with the ability to apply several external and internal boundary
> conditions, including flow and stage hydrographs, rating curves, gated
> and uncontrolled spillways, pump stations, bridges, culverts, and
> levee systems. The UNET program was originally developed by Barkau
> (1992).
>
> The program uses an unsteady flow solver at each node for each time
> step, and data are organized for each cross section. All HEC-RAS
> output options as well as complete animation of cross section,
> profile, and 3-D plots are available. This feature allows the user to
> view the dynamics of a flood wave as it moves downstream. As modern
> floodplain problems become more complex and the demand grows for more
> accurate solutions, the use of UNET within HEC-RAS will continue to
> increase. Other programs are also available to solve the dynamic
> equations presented in Chapter 4 and provide output as a flood wave
> moves downstream. A detailed unsteady- state example is provided in
> the textbook website hydrology.rice.edu.
>
> **EXAMPLE 7--7**
>
> **APPLICATION OF HEC-RAS FOR BIG CREEK**
>
> Big Creek is a small creek located about 25 miles southwest of Hous-
> ton, Texas. It is typical of many of the waterways in the Houston area
> in that it is characterized by a mild slope in the channel bed and a
> flat topography in the area surrounding. A portion of the creek has
> been modeled in HEC-RAS and will be used as the basis for the example.
> The project file is accessible to students in the textbook website
> listing in Appendix E. It contains a flow file and a geometry file of
> the existing conditions. The interested student should implement the
> channelization and bridge modifications for Big Creek by following
> along with direc- tions in the book.
>
> The problem is that a builder would like to develop a very large tract
> of land near the upstream portion of Big Creek, to consist of new
> houses and shopping centers. A hydrologic study is commissioned, and
> it is determined that the development would add 2200 cfs of additional
> flow to the 100-year storm, which has an existing flow rate of 4825
> cfs at the mouth of the reach. This consequently raises the water
> surface elevation at the cross section farthest upstream to 57.54 ft,
> an increase of 1.7 ft above the existing elevation of 55.84 ft.
> Regulations require that a development cannot raise the water surface
> elevation downstream of the development by more than 0.01 ft. The
> developer has two options. The first is to build a detention pond in
> order to alleviate the impact of increased flow. However, this would
> tie up some of his land, which is at
>
> a premium in this part of Houston. Therefore, the builder is
> interested in the feasibility of channelizing the portion of Big Creek
> downstream of the point of impact that has been modeled.
>
> In addition to the increased flow rates, the HEC-RAS model shows that
> an existing bridge is causing a backwater effect in the reach of
> interest. The bridge is an old one and was poorly designed, such that
> it increases the water surface elevation by 0.37 ft just upstream of
> the bridge. In addition to the effect of channelization, the effect of
> raising the bridge should also be considered.
>
> The model of Big Creek consists of 25 cross sections and two bridges
> over a reach length of 25,025 ft (4.74 mi). The current floodplain
> ranges in width from about 300 to about 3000 ft. The greatest changes
> in width due to increased flow in the creek occur in the upstream
> portion of the watershed due to geometry of the main channel. The
> depth of floodwaters outside the creek banks generally ranges from 1.0
> to 5.0 ft.
>
> In examining the geometry of the existing creek, one sees that the
> creek bed has a width of 60 ft. We enter the **Channel Modification**
> win- dow. We begin by setting the range of cross sections to be
> channelized. We choose to begin at Section 109047 and end at Section
> 84629, a distance of 24,418 ft. Continuing in the **Select Range of
> Values** section of the win- dow, we select center cuts and a width of
> 80 ft. The invert elevation is left blank, meaning that the existing
> depth of the channel will remain the same. A left and right side slope
> of 3 is chosen, meaning that the side slope is equal to 3 ft
> horizontally to every 1 ft vertically. The *n*-value for the cut is
> entered to be .03, which is a typical value used for channelized
> reaches. Once these values are entered, the **Apply Cuts to Selected
> Range** button is pushed. If there are no other modifications that
> need to be made to the cut, then the **Compute Cuts** button can be
> pushed. As mentioned before, a useful feature of the Channel
> Modification program is the **Cut and Fill Areas** button. This
> calculates and reports the total volume of soil that must be
> excavated. We see that it is necessary to remove 360,988 yd^3^ for
> this project. Given a base estimate of \$4.00/yd^3^, it is estimated
> that this project will cost \$1.44 million.
>
> Finally, the **Create Modified Geometry** button is pushed, and a new
> window is opened. The new geometry is saved as a new geometry file
> with a name such as "80ft channel." Finally, we return to the HEC- RAS
> main window and select **Run**, then **Steady Flow Analysis**. From
> the dropdown menu, we choose "80ft channel" as our geometry file, 100
> yr dev as our flow file, and then run the program. We can view the
> profile output table and see that the upstream water surface elevation
> has been lowered to 55.61 ft, which is almost exactly what it was
> before the proposed development. Therefore, this channelization
> project was successful in reaching its goal of properly lowering the
> water surface elevation.
>
> It is now the responsibility of the developer to weigh the advantages
> of the channelization against the economic and environmental costs of
> the project. Channelization often leads to destruction of the riparian
> habitat, and this must be seriously considered. The developer may also
> look into the option of using an off-line detention pond as a means of
> flood attenuation, which may not create the environmental damage that
> channelization may incur. The option of using a detention pond is
> explored using HEC-HMS, which is discussed in Chapter 5.
>
> The issue of raising the bridge needs to be examined. The bridge in
> question is located at Section 97030. The area underneath the bridge
> that is open to flow is too small for the flow at the rate that it
> must pass through, and the physical mass of the bridge structure is
> creating a dam- ming effect on the water. To examine this backwater
> effect, open a water surface profile plot from the **View** menu in
> the main project win- dow. The sudden increase seen in the water
> surface elevation upstream of bridge Section 97030 indicates that the
> bridge is holding water back. One solution to this problem is to
> create a greater area for flow by rais- ing the old bridge. In
> HEC-RAS, the user enters the Deck/Roadway window from the Bridge
> Culvert Data Editor. The high and low chords can be altered so that
> over the channel section, the high and low chords are raised to 57 and
> 55 ft, respectively, and pier heights should also be mod- ified, using
> Pier Editor. The changes are saved and the results are run in HEC-RAS.
>
> The final results are easily compared using the water surface profile
> plot. The newest geometry, with the improved channel and raised
> bridge, can be compared against the original conditions. It is seen
> that down- stream of bridge Section 97030, the two water surface
> profiles match up almost exactly. Upstream of bridge Section 97030,
> the original conditions actually have a slightly higher water surface
> elevation due to the back- water effect at the bridge. It is seen then
> that the channelization has maintained the water surface elevation,
> and the raised bridge actually improves the water surface elevation.

1.  The Colorado River System Aqueduct has the cross section shown in
    Fig- ure P7--1. When the water in the aqueduct is 11 ft deep, flow
    is measured as 1600 cfs. If *n* = 0.014, what is *S*~0~ in (a) ft/ft
    and (b) ft/mi?

2.  A rectangular open channel that is 2 m wide has water flowing at a
    > depth of

> 0.50 m. Using *n* = 0.014, find the rate of flow in the channel if
> *S*~0~ is (a) 0.002 m/m, (b) 0.006 m/m, and (c) 0.012 m/m.

3.  A channel has the irregular shape shown in Figure P7--3, with a
    > bottom slope of 0.0016 ft/ft. The indicated Manning's *n*-values
    > apply to the corresponding areas only. Assuming that *Q* =

4.  Water is flowing 2.5 m deep in a rectangular channel that is 2.5 m
    > wide. The average velocity is 5.8 m/s and C = 100 What is the
    > slope of the channel? (Use Chezy's formula.)

5.  A triangular channel with side slopes at 45 degrees to the
    > horizontal has water flowing through it at a velocity of 10 ft/s.
    > Find Chezy's roughness coefficient *C* if the bed slope is 0.05
    > ft/ft and the depth is 4 ft.

6.  Water is flowing at a rate of 900 cfs in a trapezoidal open channel.
    > Given that *S*~0~ = 0.001, *n* = 0.015, bottom width *b* = 25 ft,
    > and the side slopes are 1:1.5, what is the normal depth *y~n~*?

7.  Find the normal depth *y~n~* for the triangular channel shown in
    Figure P7--7 if

    channel of Prob- lem 7.7 if *Q* is (a) 20 m^3^/s and (b) 50 cfs.

10. Determine the local change in water surface elevation caused by a
    0.2-ft-high obstruction in the bottom of a 10-ft-wide rectangular
    channel on a slope of 0.0005 ft/ft. The rate of flow is 25 cfs and
    the unobstructed flow depth is 0.9 ft. (See Fig. P7--10). Assume no
    head loss.

11. A rectangular channel with *n* = 0.012 is 5 ft wide and is built on
    a slope of 0.0006 ft/ft. At point *a,* the flow rate is 60 cfs and
    *y~a~* = 3 ft. Using one reach, find the distance to point *b* where
    *y~b~* = 2.5 ft and determine whether this point is upstream or
    downstream of point *a.*

12. If a channel with the same cross-sectional and flow properties as
    the chan- nel of Problem 7.11 is laid on a slope of 0.01 ft/ft,
    determine whether the flow is supercritical or subcritical. Find the
    depth of flow at a point 1000 ft downstream from the point where *y*
    = 1.5 ft. (A trial-and-error solution may be necessary.)

13. Classify the water surface profiles according to Table 7--2 of (a)
    Problem 7.11 and (b) Problem 7.12.

14. Classify the bed slopes (mild, critical, steep) of the channels of
    the following problems: (a) Problem 7.1, (b) Problem 7.6, and (c)
    Problem 7.7.

15. A stream bed has a rectangular cross Section 5 m wide and a slope of
    0.0002 m/m. The rate of flow in the stream is 8.75 m^3^/s. A dam is
    built across the stream, causing the water surface to rise to 2.5 m
    just upstream of the dam. (See Fig. P7--15.) Using the step method
    illustrated in Example 7--5, determine the

> water surface profile upstream of the dam to a point where *y* =

16. A rectangular concrete channel (*n* = 0.020) changes from a mild
    > slope to a steep slope. The channel is 20 m wide throughout, and
    > the rate of flow is 180 m^3^/s. If the slope of the mild portion
    > of the channel is 0.0006 m/m, determine the distance upstream from
    > the slope change to the point where *y* = 3.0 m. (*Hint:* Use the
    > same step method as in Example 7--5, with *y* intervals of 0.1 m.)

17. A rectangular channel 1.4 m wide on a slope of 0.0026 m/m has water
    > flow- ing through it at a rate of 1 m^3^/s and a depth of 0.6 m. A
    > cross section of the channel is constricted to a width of 0.9 m.
    > What is the change in water surface elevation at this point?

> **Problems 7.18 through 7.20 refer to the watershed shown in Figs.

19. Assume that East Creek meets Cypress Creek as shown. Using a
    starting eleva- tion at point *C* consistent with the 100-yr flow in
    Cypress Creek, develop the 100-yr water surface profile for East
    Creek. Use six points between the starting elevation and the
    elevation *y* = 1.1*y~n~*.

20. A developer proposes improvements to the East Creek subwatershed
    that will increase the peak flow of the 100-yr storm by 1000 cfs.
    The developer contends that there will be no change in the 100-yr
    elevations on the East Creek above point *C.* Determine the 100-yr
    water surface profile for East Creek. Use an interval of Δ*y* = 0.15
    ft. up to *y* = 1.1*y~n~*. Discuss.

21. Lost Creek has a rectangular channel 2 mi in length (10,560 ft) with
    a wooden bridge in the middle of this reach (*x* = 5280 ft). (See
    Fig. P7--21.) The channel is dredged earth (*n* = 0.025) with a
    bottom width of 200 ft and a bed slope of

> 0.001. The computed 100-yr peak flow is 12,000 cfs for the entire 2-mi
> reach.

1.  For Lost Creek in Problem 7.21, the initial downstream water
    elevation is 10 ft. A house is to be built at a distance of *x* =
    2640 ft upstream of the bridge.

    a.  At what elevation should the house foundation be built to ensure
        > 100-yr flood protection (neglect effects of the bridge)? Note
        > the water velocity just downstream of the bridge.

    b.  Compute the head loss through the bridge according to the
        > Yarnell equa- tion \[Eq. (7--37)\] using *K* = 0.95, *a* =
        > 1\>10, and the velocity just down- stream of the bridge as
        > computed in part (a).

    c.  Determine slab elevation of the house for flood safety, taking
        > into account the effects of the bridge. Compare the slab
        > elevation in part (a) to that computed in part (b). What
        > effect (if any) does the bridge have on the slab elevation?

2.  Derive the backwater curve for Example 7--5 with a starting
    downstream elevation of 8.0 ft. Repeat the calculation for 9.0 ft.
    All other parameters remain the same.

3.  Set up the input data structure to run Example 7--5 using HEC-RAS,
    with a starting downstream elevation of (a) 8.0 and (b) 9.0 ft.

4.  Refer to the HEC-RAS user's manual as needed. Run the sample river
    dataset provided in the tutorial.

> **For Problems 7.26--7.30, set up the Big Creek data for Example 7--7,
> available from the textbook website (see Appendix E).**

5.  Run the existing condition 100-year floodplain and plot the profile
    > output with HEC-RAS. Rerun the model with a 25% increase in flow
    > rate and compare.

6.  Evaluate the effect of removing the upstream bridge at Section
    > 106365 on the backwater profile in HEC-RAS.

7.  Evaluate the effect of increasing the downstream boundary condition
    > water elevation by 2.0 ft in HEC-RAS.

8.  Run the existing condition 100-year floodplain and plot three cross
    > sections as well as the X-Y-Z perspective plot with HEC-RAS.

9.  Set up the Big Creek data for Example 7--7, available from the
    > Prentice Hall website (see Appendix E). Investigate the effects of
    > changing Manning's *n*- values for the channel from 0.04 to 0.06
    > and from 0.08 to 0.10 for ROB and LOB areas in HEC-RAS.

> **PROPERTIES OF GROUND WATER**
>
> **Vertical Distribution of Ground Water**
>
> Ground water can be characterized according to vertical distribution,
> as shown in Figure 8--3, which indicates the main divisions of
> subsurface water. The unsaturated zone or **vadose zone** extends
> above the water table and includes the soil water zone down to the
> water table, which divides the unsat- urated zone from the saturated
> zone. The **water table** is defined as the level to which water will
> rise in a well drilled into the saturated zone. Thickness may vary
> from a few feet for high water table conditions to several hundred
> feet in arid regions of the country, such as Arizona or New Mexico.
>
> The **soil water zone,** which extends from the ground surface down
> through the major root zone, varies with soil type and vegetation. The
> amount of water present in the soil water zone depends primarily on
> recent exposure to rainfall and infiltration. Following rainfall, the
> water content in this zone will decrease due to downward drainage as
> well as losses to evaporation and root uptake. **Hygroscopic water**
> remains adsorbed to the surface of soil grains, while **gravitational
> water** drains through the soil under the influence of gravity.
> **Capillary water** is held in the zone just above the water table and
> exists because water can be pulled upward from the water table by
> surface tension. The capillary zone, or fringe, extends from the water
> table up to the limit of **capillary rise,** which varies inversely
> with the pore size of the soil and directly with the surface tension.
> Capillary rise can range from a few cm for fine gravel to more than
> 200 cm for silt (Todd and Mays, 2005). Just above the water table
> almost all pores contain capillary water, but then the water content

>
> In the saturated zone, which occurs beneath the water table, the
> **porosity** is a direct measure of the water contained per unit
> volume, expressed as the ratio of the volume of voids to the total
> volume. Porosity ranges from 25% to 35% for most aquifer systems. Only
> a portion of the water can be removed from the saturated zone by
> drainage or by pumping from a well. **Specific yield** is defined as
> the volume of water released from an unconfined aquifer per unit
> surface area per unit head decline in the water table. Fine-grained
> materials yield little water, whereas coarse-grained materials provide
> sig- nificant water and thus serve as aquifers. In general, specific
> yields for unconsolidated formations fall in the range of 7% to 25%.
>
> For water supply or to study the characteristics of aquifer systems,
> wells are often installed. A **well** is a vertical hole dug into the
> earth, usually cased with metal or PVC plastic up to the land surface.
> Often, the portion of the well hole that is open to the aquifer is
> **screened** to prevent aquifer material from entering the well. A
> vertical penetration used to collect soil or water samples that is not
> cased is called a borehole. Wells are generally placed into the
> saturated zone and are pumped for water supply for municipal, agricul-
> tural, and industrial customers. Wells can also be used for recharge,
> disposal of contaminated water or saltwater, and for water level
> observation. For more detail on well construction methods, see Section
> 8.11.
>
> **Aquifer Systems**
>
> An **aquifer** can be defined as a formation that contains sufficient
> permeable material to yield significant quantities of water to wells
> and springs. Aquifers are generally areally extensive and may be
> overlain or underlain by confining beds. Many aquifers in the United
> States have been extensively evaluated for water supply and for
> contamination problems. Several aquifers of note include the Edwards
> limestone near Austin, Texas, Ogallala in West Texas, and the Floridan
> Aquifer, the subject of a detailed modeling case study in Section
> 8.12.
>
> An **aquiclude** is saturated and is a relatively impermeable
> confining unit, such as clay, that might act as a confining layer
> above or below an aquifer system. An **aquitard** is a saturated, low
> permeability stratum, such as a silty clay, that may leak water from
> one aquifer to another.
>
> Aquifers can be characterized by the porosity of the rock or soil,
> expressed as the ratio of the volume of voids *V~v~* to the total
> volume *V.* Poros- ity may also be expressed by
>
> *n [V~v~]{.underline} V*
>
> = 1 - [r*b*]{.underline} , (8--1)
>
> r*~m~*
>
> where r*~m~* is the **density** of the grains and r*~b~* is the **bulk
> density**, defined as the oven-dried mass of the sample divided by its
> original volume. Table 8--1 shows a range of porosities for a number
> of aquifer materials, but usually 25% to 30% is assumed for most
> aquifers. Fractured rock or limestone can have lower porosities in the
> range of 1% to 10%.
>
> Unconsolidated geologic materials are normally classified according to
> their size and distribution. Soil classification based on particle
> size is shown in Table 8--2. Particle sizes are measured by
> mechanically sieving grain sizes larger than 0.05 mm and measuring
> rates of settlement for smaller particles in suspension. A typical
> particle-size distribution graph is shown in Figure 8--5. The
> **uniformity coefficient**, defined as *D*~60~ *D*~10~, indicates the
> relative uniformity of the material. A uniform material such as fine
> beach sand has a low uniformity coefficient, while a well-graded
> material such as **alluvium** has a high coefficient (Fig. 8--5).

> Figure 8--6 shows a vertical cross section illustrating unconfined and
> con- fined aquifers. An unconfined aquifer is one in which a water
> table exists, which often rises and falls with changes in rainfall and
> recharge. Shallow wells are usu- ally placed to help define the level
> of water and the general direction of flow, based on the slope of the
> water table. Confined aquifers occur where ground water is confined by
> a relatively impermeable stratum, or confining unit, and water is
> under pressure greater than atmospheric. If a well penetrates such an
> aquifer, the water level will rise above the bottom of the confining
> unit. If the water level rises above the land surface, a flowing well
> or spring results and is referred to as an **artesian well**. Details
> on wells are provided in Section 8.11.
>
> A recharge area supplies water to a confined aquifer, and such an
> aqui- fer can convey water from the recharge area to locations of
> natural or arti- ficial discharge. The **piezometric surface**
> (potentiometric surface) of a confined aquifer is the hydrostatic
> pressure level of water in the aquifer, defined by the water level
> that occurs in a lined penetrating well. It should be noted that a
> confined aquifer can become unconfined when the surface falls below
> the bottom of the upper confining bed. Contour maps and pro- files can
> be prepared of the water table for an unconfined aquifer or the
> piezometric surface for a confined aquifer. These **equipotential
> lines** are lines of constant head and will be described in more
> detail in Section 8.7. Figure 8--7 depicts a simple flow net, which is
> a set of constant head and orthogonal streamlines to indicate the
> direction of flow (from higher head to lower head) in a ground water
> system.

> piezometric head. For a confined aquifer, values of *S* fall in the
> range of 0.00005 to 0.005, indicating that large pressure changes
> produce small changes in the storage volume. For unconfined aqui-
> fers, a change in storage volume is expressed simply by the product of
> the volume of aquifer lying below the water table at the beginning and
> end of a period of time and the average specific yield of the
> formation. Thus, the storage coefficient for an unconfined aquifer is

> **Darcy's Law**
>
> The movement of ground water is well established by hydraulic
> principles reported in 1856 by Henri Darcy, who investigated the flow
> of water through beds of permeable sand. Darcy discovered one of the
> most important laws in hydrology---that the flow rate through porous
> media is proportional to the head loss and inversely proportional to
> the length of the flow path. Darcy's law serves as the basis for
> present-day knowledge of ground water flow and well hydraulics and
> forms the basis for the governing ground water flow equations (Section
> 8.5).

> The negative sign indicates that flow of water is in the direction of

*Q*

> *V~s~* = *nA* . (8--5)

> Thus, actual seepage velocities are usually much higher (by a factor

>
> **Hydraulic Conductivity**
>
> The hydraulic conductivity of a soil or rock depends on a variety of
> physical factors and is an indication of an aquifer's ability to
> transmit water. Thus, sand aquifers have *K* values many orders of
> magnitude larger than clay units. Table 8--3 indicates representative
> values of hydraulic conductivity for a variety of materials. As can be
> seen, *K* can vary over many orders of magni- tude in an aquifer that
> may contain different types of material. Typical val- ues would be 10
> ^-2^ cm/sec for sand, 10 ^-4^ cm/sec for silt, and 10 ^-7^ cm/sec for
> clay aquifers. Thus, velocities and flow rates can also vary over the
> same range, as expressed by Darcy's law.
>
> **Transmissivity** is a term often used in ground water hydraulics as
> applied to confined aquifers. It is defined as the product of *K* and
> the aver- age saturated thickness of the aquifer, *b*. Hydraulic
> conductivity *K* is usually expressed in m/day (ft/day), and
> transmissivity *T* in m^2^/day (ft^2^/day). An older unit for *T* that
> is still reported in some texts is gal/day/ft. Common conversion
> factors are contained in Table 8--3.

The equation can be used to obtain aquifer constants *S* and *T* by
means of pump- ing tests at fully penetrating wells. It is widely used
because a value of *S* can be determined, only one observation well and
a relatively short pumping period are required, and large portions of
the flow field can be sampled with one test. The assumptions inherent in
the Theis equation should be included,

> since they are often overlooked:

1.  The aquifer is homogeneous, isotropic, uniformly thick, and of infi-
    > nite areal extent.

2.  Prior to pumping, the piezometric surface is horizontal.

3.  The fully penetrating well is pumped at a constant rate.

4.  Flow is horizontal within the aquifer.

5.  Storage within the well can be neglected.

6.  Water removed from storage responds instantaneously with a declin-
    > ing head.

> These assumptions are seldom completely satisfied for a field problem,
> but the method still provides one of the most useful and accurate
> techniques for aquifer characterization. The complete Theis solution
> requires the graph- ical solution of two equations with four unknowns:

*s*\' *Q*

4p*T*

> *W*(*u*), (8--52)
>
> *r* a 4*T*
>
> *t S*

b *u*. (8--53)

> The relation between *W*(*u*) and *u* must be the same as that between
> *s*\' and *r*^2^ *t*, because all other terms are constants in the
> equations. Theis suggested a solution based on graphical
> superposition. Example 8--6 indicates how a plot of *W*(*u*) vs. *u*,
> called a type curve, is superimposed over observed time-- drawdown
> data while keeping the coordinate axes parallel. The two plots are
> adjusted until a position is found by trial, such that most of the
> observed data fall on a segment of the type curve. Any convenient
> point is selected, and values of *W*(*u*), *u*, *s*\', and *r*^2^ *t*

> **Slug Tests**
>
> Slug tests involve the use of a single well for the determination of
> aquifer formation constants. Rather than pumping the well for a period
> of time, as described in the previous section, a volume of water is
> suddenly removed or added to the well casing and observations of
> recovery or drawdown are noted through time. By careful evaluation of
> the drawdown curve and knowledge of the well screen geometry, it is
> possible to derive *K* or *T* for an aquifer.
>
> Typical procedure for a slug test requires use of a rod of slightly

> **Shallow Well Construction**
>
> A **water well** is a vertical hole dug into the earth, usually
> designed for bringing ground water to the surface. Wells can be used
> for pumping, artificial recharge, waste disposal, water level
> observation, and water quality monitoring. A vari- ety of methods
> exist for constructing wells, depending on the flow rate, depth to
> ground water, geologic condition, casing material, and economic
> factors.
>
> Prior to drilling a well in a new area, a test hole is normally
> drilled and a record, or log, is kept of various geologic formations
> and the depths at which they are encountered. Cable tool, rotary, and
> jetting methods are commonly employed for making test holes. Sample
> cuttings are often col- lected at selected depths and later studied
> and analyzed for grain size distri- bution. Borings can be removed
> using a Shelby tube or a split-spoon sampler, and these cores can be
> analyzed for a variety of parameters, such as hydrau- lic
> conductivity, porosity, grain size, texture, and soil classification.
>
> Shallow wells are usually less than 15 m deep and are constructed by
> digging, boring, driving, or jetting methods. Dug wells are generally
> exca- vated by hand and are vertical holes in the ground that
> intersect the water table. A modern domestic dug well should have a
> rock curb, a concrete seal, and a pump to lift water to the surface.
> Bored wells are constructed with hand-operated or power-driven augers,
> available in several shapes and sizes, with cutting blades that bore
> into the ground with a rotary motion. When the blades fill with loose
> earth, the auger is removed from the hole and emptied. Depths up to 30
> m can be achieved under favorable conditions. Hand-bored wells seldom
> exceed 20 cm in diameter.
>
> A continuous-flight power auger has a spiral extending from the bottom
> of the hole to the surface, and sections of the auger may be added as
> depth increases. Cuttings are carried to the surface in the drilling
> process, and depths up to 50 m can be achieved with truck-mounted
> equipment. Hollow- stem augers are often used to construct
> small-diameter wells, which are asso- ciated with waste sites for
> monitoring or pumping. Augers work best in formations that do not
> cave, such as where some clay or silt is present in the aquifer.

> Driven wells consist of a series of pipe lengths driven vertically
> down- ward by repeated impacts into the ground. Water enters the wells
> through a drive point at the lower end, which consists of a screened,
> cylindrical section, protected by a steel cone. Driven wells usually
> have diameters of less than 10 cm, with depths generally below 15 m.
> Yields from driven wells are usu- ally fairly small, but a battery of
> such wells connected to a single pipe and pump are effective for
> lowering water-table elevations. Such a system is known as a
> well-point system and is used for de-watering excavations for
> subsurface construction. Jetted wells are constructed with a
> high-velocity
>
> stream of water directed vertically downward, while the casing that is
> low- ered into the hole conducts the water and cuttings to the
> surface. Small- diameter holes, up to 10 cm, with depths up to 15 m,
> can be installed in unconsolidated formations. Because of the speed of
> installation, jetted wells are useful for observation wells and
> well-point systems.
>
> **Deep Well Construction**
>
> Most deep wells of high capacity are constructed by drilling with a
> cable tool or with one of several rotary methods. Construction
> techniques vary depend- ing on the type of geologic formation, depth
> of the well, and required flow rate. Cable tool drilling is
> accomplished by regular lifting and dropping of a string of tools,
> with a sharp bit on the lower end to break rock by impact. The method
> is most useful for consolidated rock materials to depths of 600 m.
>
> A rapid method for drilling in unconsolidated formations (sands or
> silts) is the rotary method, which consists of drilling with a hollow,
> rotating bit, with drilling mud, or water used to increase efficiency.
> No casing is required with drilling mud, because the mud forms a clay
> lining on the wall of the well.
>
> Drilling mud consists of a suspension of water, bentonite clay, and
> various organic additives. Proper mixture is essential for
> trouble-free drill- ing. This method is used extensively for oil
> wells. Advantages are the rapid drilling rate and the convenience for
> electric logging. Air rotary methods use compressed air in place of
> drilling mud and are convenient for consolidated formations. Drilling
> depths can exceed 150 m under favorable conditions.
>
> **Well Completion and Pumping**
>
> Once a well has been drilled, it must be completed in such a way that
> it remains an efficient producer of water. This may involve
> installation of cas- ing, cementing, placement of well screens, and
> gravel packs. Well casings serve as a lining to maintain an open hole
> up to the ground surface. They provide structural support against
> caving materials and seal out surface water. Casing materials include
> wrought iron, steel, and PVC pipe.
>
> Wells are cemented in the annular space around the casing to prevent
> entrance of water of unsatisfactory quality. Cement grout, which may
> con- tain additives, is usually introduced at the bottom of the space
> to ensure proper sealing. **Grout seals** are common for layered
> aquifers, where it is desirable to pump from one layer while not
> disturbing another. **Well screens**, typically used for
> unconsolidated formations, are perforated sections of pipe of variable
> length that allow ground water to flow into the well. Their main
> purpose is to prevent aquifer material, such as sand or gravel, from
> entering the well and to minimize hydraulic resistance to flow.
> Screens are made of a variety of metals and metal alloys, PVC, and
> wood. Where a well screen is to be surrounded by an artificial
> **gravel pack**, the size of the screen openings is governed by the
> size of the gravel (see Fig. 8--26).
>
> A gravel pack that envelops a well screen is designed to stabilize the
> aquifer and provide an annular zone of high-permeability material. In
> lay- ered systems, gravel packs can provide conduits of flow from one
> layer to another and should be separated by grout plugs. Details on
> gravel-pack material and well-screen sizes are available from Campbell
> and Lehr (1973). Well development follows completion and is designed
> to increase the hydraulic efficiency by removing the finer material
> from the formation sur- rounding the screen. The importance of well
> development is often over- looked but is required to produce
> full-potential yields. Development procedures include pumping,
> surging, use of compressed air, hydraulic jet- ting, chemical
> addition, and use of explosives. The methods are discussed in
>
> Campbell and Lehr (1973) and will not be described in detail here.
>
> For shallow wells, low-capacity and low-head pumps can be used. For
> deeper wells used to supply water for municipal or agricultural needs,
> deep- well turbine and submersible pumps are needed. Pump impellers
> are con- tained in bowls and can be connected in series to deliver
> high heads. They are suspended vertically on a long drive shaft driven
> by a surface-mounted motor. Whenever ground water is pumped and is to
> be used for human consumption, proper sanitary precautions must be
> taken to protect water quality. Surface pollution can enter wells
> through the annular space or through the top of the well itself.
> Cement grout outside the casing and a watertight cover of concrete
> should be installed for protection. Samples of well water should be
> evaluated for quality after development and after periods of excessive
> flooding, if con- tamination is suspected. Wells are often associated
> with septic tank systems in rural areas, and most communities have
> requirements on the distance neces- sary to separate a water well from
> the nearest septic tank as a measure of sanitary protection. Ground
> water contamination in wells is discussed in detail in Freeze and
> Cherry (1979), Bedient et al. (1999), and Charbeneau (2000).

> access to data from federal and state agencies. Mathematical models in
> ground water have been greatly expanded and improved in recent years,
> especially with the advent of graphical user interfaces (GUI). One

> A completely revised and updated version of the original Trescott et

> **Introduction**
>
> Ground water overpumping and aquifer depletion are now a serious prob-
> lem in many parts of the United States and around the world. Aquifers
> in New York, Texas, Idaho, Arizona, Washington, and California have
> all felt the impacts of overpumping and overuse (USGS, 1999).
> Worldwide, the consumption of fresh water is doubling every 20 years,
> which is more than twice the rate of the increase in human population
> (Barlow, 1999). This mas- sive consumption of water is placing
> enormous pressures on areas where aquatic ecosystems dominate,
> especially lakes and wetlands, as in Florida.

> water pumping in the layered, Karst aquifer system near Tampa,
> Florida. Impacts of overpumping are discussed, with a brief

> Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) had an existing
> MODFLOW model based on data from 1993, and the original model was
> updated using new information incorporated through 1998. The results
> of present and projected pumping of ground water were evaluated using
> existing and improved numerical ground water flow models, based on the
> original model. The case study provides the student with a unique view
> of how such models are applied for a large and complex aquifer system,
> in order to better manage the water resources in the five-county
> region of southwest Florida.
>
> In Florida, water resources are an integral part of the state's
> welfare, affecting the state's economy, natural environment, and
> future growth pos- sibilities. Florida currently relies on ground
> water for over 90% of its water supply. Florida's increase in
> population in the last few decades has led to additional development
> and an intensified water need for agriculture, industry, and public
> supplies. In order to provide for this additional water use and to
> plan for future growth and demand, the state has worked on developing
> long-range plans for protecting its water resources, at both the state
> and local levels.
>
> One of the state's most stressed areas in terms of water resources is
> located in the Northern Tampa Bay (NTB) region (Fig. 8--27). Ground
> water pumping for water supply in the NTB area, which encompasses part
> or all of Hillsborough, Hernando, Pasco, Pinellas, and Polk counties,
> has doubled in the past 30 years (Fig. 8--28). In 1966, 44.2 million

> **Aquifer Systems and Overpumping**
>
> In order to quantify the ground water effects of pumping in a complex
> sys- tem, it is important to first identify the interactions between
> the ground water and the surface water. Ground water and surface water
> are intricately interconnected in the NTB area because of the Karst
> limestone features that underlie the area. Figure 8--29 shows many of
> the hydraulic links that often exist in Karst systems, such as
> fractures and layering of units. Water enters the ground water system
> through pathways such as rainfall and recharge, and it leaves the
> system through pathways such as runoff, ground water outflow, and
> evapotranspiration. Many interactions are also occurring between the
> different layers of the system. For example, the NTB area has two area
> aquifers, the surficial aquifer and the Floridan Aquifer, which are
> separated by leaky confining beds. Vertical transfer of water occurs
> across these leaky layers and is related to rates of pumping from the
> lower aquifer (Figs. 8--24 and 8--29).

> The NTB MODFLOW model area covers approximately 1500 square miles and
> includes two principal aquifers, the surficial aquifer and the Upper
> Floridan Aquifer. The NTB model represents these aquifers as three
> layers, with layer 1 simulating the surficial aquifer, layer 2
> simulating the Tampa/ Suwanee portion of the Floridan Aquifer, and
> layer 3 simulating the Avon Park Formation portion of the Floridan
> Aquifer. The surficial aquifer is defined to be approximately 35 ft
> thick, while the Upper Floridan is a total of 900 ft thick and is
> divided into 500 ft in layer 2 and 400 ft in layer 3. The aquifer
> layers are separated by semiconfining zones, which allow for vertical
> interchange between the layers (USGS, 1989).
>
> Due to the Karst geology present in this area, the area's ground water
> and surface water are closely interconnected, which leads to major
> concerns over the present and projected increases in pumping
> throughout the area. Over- pumping of water from aquifer systems can
> cause both direct and indirect prob- lems. Direct effects include
> lowering of the potentiometric surface of the aquifer, lowering the
> water table of the shallow aquifer, lowering of the amount of water
> available for surface runoff, deterioration of water quality, and
> increased pump- ing costs (Drew and Hotzl, 1999). An example of water
> quality deterioration is the potential for seawater intrusion.
> Overpumping of coastal aquifers produces a lowering of water-table
> levels, which are protected by the recharge in the coastal strip of
> the sea level. When extracted volumes are greater than the recharge,
> saltwater begins to intrude into the aquifer (Freeze and Cherry,
> 1979). In the Pinellas County coastal subregion, a study done by the
> SWFWMD detailed that water quality trends indicate localized seawater
> intrusion may be occurring. Chloride data from wells in this area show
> the number of significant
>
> increasing chloride trends (SWFWMD, 1999). For the interested student,
> a more detailed discussion of saltwater intrusion can be found in
> Fetter (1994).
>
> One of the most serious effects observed in the NTB area has been the
> decline of ground water levels, which have dropped in some areas as
> much as 20 ft between the 1940s and 1990s (SWFWMD, 1993). The decline
> in aquifer water levels can also cause many problems with surface
> water bodies. In the NTB area there is currently concern over the
> effect of lowered water levels on lakes, wetlands, springs, and
> reduced stream flow in river systems caused by overpumping in the
> area. The effect of pumping on the surface water bodies is dependent
> on a variety of factors. These include

-   the distance between the pumping well and the lake,

-   the rate and duration of pumping,

-   geologic and hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer,

-   vertical permeability and thickness of the confining beds,

-   difference in head established between the deeper aquifer and the
    > shallow water-table aquifer, and

-   the degree of interconnection between the lake bottoms and the
    > under- lying unconsolidated sediments and the limestone (Stewart,
    > 1968).

> **Data Collection and Model Input**
>
> The NTB model is an example of a regional model that includes 11 well
> fields in a five-county region that covers a total of 1500 square
> miles (SWF- WMD, 1993). The NTB model takes advantage of the
> flexibility allowed by MODFLOW in having variable spacing with
> grid-cell areas ranging from
>
> 0.25 to 1 square mile. This variable spacing was selected to allow for
> smaller grid cells around areas of high ground water use and areas
> with well-defined hydrogeological information. The grid area includes
> 62 rows and 69 columns that are bounded by constant-head boundaries,
> no-flow boundaries, and general head boundaries.
>
> Observation data were used to assess both spatial and temporal agree-
> ment of the models. For temporal comparisons, all available data
> points were compared; but for spatial comparisons, 17 locations were
> selected as representative samples across the region (Fig. 8--30).
> These locations were selected to be representative of both aquifer
> levels as well as to be widely distributed across the grid. The three
> clusters of wells near Eldridge Wilde and Morris Bridge well fields
> were selected to study the model's ability to simulate the local
> impacts around large-volume pumping centers.
>
> Ground water models require input information to define the hydrogeo-
> logic and hydrogeochemical conditions of the area. The input
> information is categorized into three areas: geologic, physical and
> chemical parameters, and

> external stress parameters. The geologic inputs outline the location
> of the boundaries and thickness of geologic units in the model. The
> external stresses include inputs on pumping, injection, and recharge.
> The physical and chemical parameter inputs define the hydraulic
> conductivity, porosity, transmissivity, and evapotranspiration of each
> grid cell. The recharge value is based on land use, average rainfall
> in subbasins, and a recharge coefficient predetermined by the water
> district. Changes in growth and development require temporal updating
> of parameters such as pumping, recharge, and evapotranspiration. It is
> impor- tant to note that model input parameters are never completely
> defined; there is always associated uncertainty of sampling and
> interpolation error (Zheng and Bennett, 1995). The calibrated SWFWMD
> 1993 model was used as the starting point for this study. The
> calibrated model provided all initial estimates of trans- missivity,
> hydraulic conductivity, storage, leakage, recharge, and evapotranspi-
> ration. These values are based on model data sets collected from the
> tricounty well-field model and the Pasco County water resources model
> (Fretwell, 1988) and on field data collected by the NTB project and
> other investigators.
>
> **GMS and Modflow**
>
> The Groundwater Modeling System (GMS) model is a robust and compre-
> hensive ground water modeling package that provides tools for every
> phase of a ground water simulation, including site description, model
> development, postprocessing, calibration, and visualization. Modeling
> with GMS allows
>
> the user variation and flexibility in graphical output. GMS includes a
> sophis- ticated multilayer MODFLOW interface that allows models to be
> defined and edited at the conceptual model level or on a cell-by-cell
> basis at the grid level. MODFLOW is one of the most widely used flow
> models and consists of a main program and a series of independent
> subroutines grouped into modules, or packages. Each package deals with
> a specific feature of the hydrologic system, such as flow from rivers,
> recharge, or transmissivity. The division of the program into packages
> allows the user to analyze the specific hydrologic features of the
> model independently.
>
> MODFLOW is a three-dimensional finite-difference ground water flow
> model, developed for the USGS by McDonald and Harbaugh (1988). MODFLOW
> is based on solving the following partial differential equation for
> head in three-dimensional movement of ground water of constant density
> through porous media:
>
> [0]{.underline} a*K~xx~* [0*h*]{.underline} b + [0]{.underline}
> a*K~yy~* [0*h*]{.underline} b + [0]{.underline} a*K~zz~*
> [0*h*]{.underline} b - *W* = *S~s~* [0*h*]{.underline}, (8--64)
>
> 0*x* 0*x* 0*y* 0*y* 0*z* 0*z* 0*t*
>
> where *K~xx~*, *K~yy~*, and *K~zz~* are defined as the hydraulic
> conductivity along the coordinate axis, *h* represents the
> potentiometric head, *W* is the volumetric flux per unit volume being
> pumped, *S~s~* is the specific storage of the aquifer, and *t* is the
> time.
>
> MODFLOW uses a block-centered finite-difference grid approach in which
> flux boundaries are always located at the edge of the block (Anderson
> and Woessner, 1992). The model can handle unconfined or confined
> systems, external stresses such as wells, areal recharge,
> evapotranspiration, flow to drains, and flow through rivers. It is
> considered the standard flow model in the field and is often linked
> with other contaminant transport models to sim- ulate movement of
> chemicals in the subsurface. The model is designed so that it can be
> modified easily and executed on a variety of computers, and it is
> efficient to use with graphical programs such as GMS (Bedient et al.,
> 1999).
>
> **Case Study Results**
>
> In order to update the SWFWMD's model, which was based upon data from
> 1993, the MODFLOW model needed to be restructured using data through
> 1998. Simulations were performed using various combinations of
> pumping, recharge, transmissivity, and evapotranspiration input files.
> Results were analyzed for both temporal and spatial agreement.
> Recharge was a main parameter not known with significant accuracy due
> to lack of necessary hydrogeologic data, changes in land use, rainfall
> pattern variation, and the fact that some overprediction was observed
> in the original 1993 model runs. In addition, recharge was evaluated
> by the SWFWMD on an annual basis, which masked fluctuations that
> occurred on a monthly basis. Thus, recharge was altered to account for
> the variability in data; several recharge data sets were considered,
> which utilized the current annual average recharge from

> observation stations and 40 representative time steps, were performed
> for the period from 1989--1998. The 70% recharge simulation, as shown
> in Figure 8--31, proved to be the most accurate simula- tion tested,

> all smaller than the district's pre- vious model, which had an MAE of
> 6.48 ft and consistently overpredicted with an average ME of - 5.06

> rates from the Upper Floridan Aquifer (2010 Current Pumpage) along
> with the 70% recharge condition. The 2010 Current Pumpage simulation
> results indi- cated water levels in the aquifer would remain on
> average within 0.1 ft of the 1999 water levels that were estimated by
> the district (SWFMWD, 1993). However, both the 1999 and the 2010 water
> levels averaged 6.8 ft lower than historic levels. Since the predicted
> levels were generally much lower than historic levels, continued
> damage to lakes, wetlands, and the aquifers is expected. Thus, some
> reduction in pumpage is clearly needed.
>
> Future conditions were also projected with reduced pumping rates in
> the aquifer. When testing the effect of reduced pumping using the 2010
> Reduced Pumpage simulation, the model results indicated water levels
> increasing at the stations located near pumping fields. These 2010
> water levels had an average increase of 3.25 ft from estimated 1999
> water levels, were much closer to historic levels than the current
> projections, and were on an average 3.4 ft lower than historic levels.
> Although some locations did not meet the historic levels, they did
> improve on the current conditions, which should decrease the magnitude
> of impacts.

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Ground water hydrology is introduced and reviewed in this chapter.
> Ground water flow according to Darcy's law is described, and the
> general flow equations are de- rived for confined and unconfined
> aquifers. The theory of streamlines and equipo- tential lines is
> presented to explain flow-net concepts. Dupuit flow and seepage are
> shown for unconfined aquifers along with equations for steady radial
> flow to a well for single-well and multiple-well systems. The concept
> of superposition is presented and can be used for handling complex
> flow fields.
>
> Theis's method for unsteady well hydraulics is derived in theory and
> several applications are included; it forms the modern basis for
> aquifer pump tests. The simpler Cooper--Jacob method can be used to
> solve the unsteady-flow equation un- der certain conditions. Finally,
> radial flow in a leaky aquifer is presented in theory and example.
> Slug tests are used to determine aquifer properties using a single
> well, whereas pump tests require more than one well.
>
> Ground water modeling techniques include both analytical and numerical
> solu- tions to the governing flow equations. Usually,
> finite-difference methods for steady- state or transient flow are
> used, especially where heterogeneous properties exist. One of the most
> popular computer models for ground water flow is MODFLOW. It has
> become the model of choice for any ground water study of regional
> hydrogeology or contaminant transport. When used along with MODPATH to
> predict flow direc- tions and streamlines, it can represent any
> layered aquifer system along with complex boundary and initial
> conditions for a site. A case study using MODFLOW applied to an
> aquifer in Florida is described in detail to provide a useful level of
> coverage for the beginning student or professional. Ground water
> modeling case studies can be found in the literature and in Anderson
> and Woessner (1992), Bedient et al. (1999), Charbeneau (2000), and
> Todd and Mays (2000).

> **PROBLEMS**

1.  Compute the Darcy velocity and seepage velocity for water flowing
    through a sand column with the following characteristics:

> *K* = 10 ^-4^ cm/s,
>
> *dh*\>*dl* = 0.01, area = 75 cm^2^,
>
> *n* = 0.30.

2.  The average water-table elevation has dropped 4 ft due to the
    removal of 100,000 ac-ft from an unconfined aquifer over an area of
    75 mi^2^. Determine the storage coefficient for the aquifer.

3.  A confined aquifer is 50 m thick and 0.5 km wide. Two observation
    wells are located 1.5 km apart in the direction of flow. Head in
    well 1 is 50.0 m and in well 2 is 42 m. Hydraulic conductivity *K*
    is 0.7 m/day.

    a.  What is the total daily flow of water through the aquifer?

    b.  What is the height *z* of the piezometric surface 0.5 km from
        > well 1 and 0.9 km from well 2?

4.  A well with a diameter of 18 in. penetrates an unconfined aquifer
    that is 100 ft thick. Two observation wells are located at 100 ft
    and 235 ft from the well, and the measured drawdowns are 22.2 ft and
    21 ft, respectively. Flow is steady and the hydraulic conductivity
    is 1400 gpd/ft^2^. What is the steady-state rate of discharge from
    the well?

5.  Two piezometers are located 1200 ft apart with the bottom located at
    depths of 50 ft and 350 ft, respectively, in a 400-ft-thick
    unconfined aquifer. The depth to the water table is 50 ft in the
    deeper piezometer and 40 ft in the shallow one. Assume that
    hydraulic conductivity is 0.0002 ft/s.

    a.  Use the Dupuit equation to calculate the height of the water
        > table midway between the piezometers.

    b.  Find the flow rate per unit thickness for a section midway
        > between the wells.

6.  In a fully penetrating well, the equilibrium drawdown is 30 ft
    measured at *r* = 100 ft from the well, which pumps at a rate of 20
    gpm. The aquifer is un- confined with *K* = 30 ft/day, and the
    saturated thickness is 100 ft. What is the steady-state drawdown at
    the well (*r* = 0.5 ft) for this aquifer?

7.  A soil sample 6 in. in diameter and 1 ft long is placed in a
    falling-head per- meameter. The falling-head tube diameter is 1 in.
    and the initial head is 8 in. The head falls 1 in. over a 2-hr
    period. Calculate the hydraulic conductivity.

8.  A constant-head permeameter containing very fine-grained sand has a
    length of 12 cm and a cross-sectional area of 30 cm^2^. With a head
    of 10 cm, a total of 100 ml of water is collected in 30 min. Find
    the hydraulic conductivity.

9.  Bull Creek flows through and completely penetrates a confined
    aquifer 10 ft thick, as shown in Figure P8--9. The flow is reduced
    in the stream by 16 cfs between two gaging stations located 4 miles
    apart along the creek. On the west side of the creek, the
    piezometric contours parallel the bank and slope toward Bull Creek
    at *S* = 0.0004 ft/ft. The piezometric contours on the east side of
    the creek slope away from the channel at a slope of 0.0006 ft/ft.
    Using Darcy's law and the continuity equation, compute the
    transmissivity of the aquifer along this section of Bull Creek. Note
    that the flow area to the creek is 15 ft thick and 4 miles wide.

10. Three geologic formations overlie one another with the
    > characteristics listed below. A constant-velocity vertical flow
    > field exists across the three forma- tions. The hydraulic head is
    > 75 ft at the top of the formations and 59 ft at the bottom, with a
    > datum located at the bottom of the three units. Calculate the
    > hydraulic head at the two internal boundaries.

> *b*~1~ = 20 ft, *K*~1~ = 20 ft/day,
>
> *b*~2~ = 10 ft, *K*~2~ = 0.20 ft/day,
>
> *b*~3~ = 25 ft, *K*~3~ = 0.030 ft/day.

11. Two wells are located 100 m apart in a confined aquifer with a
    > transmissivity

> *T* = 2 . 10 ^-4^ m^2^/s and storativity *S* = 7 . 10 ^-5^. One well
> to the west is pumped
>
> at a rate of 6.6 m^3^/hr and the other to the east at a rate of 10.0
> m^3^/hr. Plot draw- down as a function of distance along the line
> joining the wells at 1 hr after the pumping starts.

12. At a waste site, a Hvorslev slug test was performed in a confined
    > aquifer with a piezometer intake length of 20 ft and a radius of 1
    > in. The radius of the rod was 0.68 in. The following recovery data
    > for the well were observed. Given that the static water level is
    > 7.58 ft and *H*~0~ = 6.88 ft, calculate the hydraulic
    > conductivity.

16. Drawdown was observed in a well located 100 ft from a pumping well
    that was pumped at a rate of 1.11 cfs (498 gpm) for a 30-hr period.
    Use the Cooper--Jacob method to compute *T* and *S* for this
    aquifer.

17. Repeat Problem 8.16 using the Theis method.

18. Refer to Figure 8--9(b), which shows a flow net under a dam section.
    > Note the values of head for the two sides of the dam, and compute
    > the seepage or flow rate through the dam if the dam is 120 ft long
    > with *K* = 20 ft/day.

19. A landfill liner is laid at elevation 50 ft msl (mean sea level) on
    > top of a good clay unit. A clean sand unit extends from elevation
    > 50 ft to elevation 75 ft, and another clay unit extends up to the
    > surface, located at elevation 100 ft. The landfill can be
    > represented by a square with length of 500 ft on a side and a
    > vertical depth of 50 ft from the surface. The landfill has a
    > 3-ft-thick clay liner with *K* = 10 ^-7^ cm/s around the sides and
    > bottom, as shown in Figure P8--19. The regional ground water level
    > for the confined sand (*K* = 10 ^-2^ cm/s) is located at a depth
    > of 10 ft below the surface, or elevation = 90 ft.

20. Repeat Problem 8.19 if the clean sand unit extends below the
    > landfill to an elevation of 25 ft msl. The clay liner exists
    > around and on the bottom of the landfill. Consider Darcy's law
    > across both the sides and bottom of the clay liner.

21. A well located at *x* = 0, *y* = 0 injects water into an aquifer at
    > *Q* = 1.0 cfs, and observation wells are located along the
    > *x*-axis at *x* = 10, 50, 150, and 300 ft away from the injection
    > well. The confined aquifer with thickness of 10 ft has *T* = 3200
    > sq ft/day and *S* = 0.005. The injection is affected by the
    > presence of a linear river located at *x* = 300 ft east of the
    > injection well. Compute the head buildup along the *x*-axis at the
    > observation-well locations after 6 hr of injection.

22. Repeat Dupuit Example 8--3 for the case where net recharge *W* = 10
    > cm/yr. Repeat the example for the case where *W* = 0.

23. Use the Theis-method equations to characterize the behavior of a
    con- fined aquifer that is homogeneous and isotropic with *T* = 500
    m^2^/day and *S* = 1 × 10 ^-5^. A single well is pumped at 2500
    m^3^/day.

    a.  Compute the drawdown 75 m away from the well at *t* = 1, 10,
        > 100, 1000, and 10,000 minutes after pumping began.

    b.  Compute the drawdown after 1.0 day of pumping at locations

> *r* = 2, 5, 10, 50, 200, and 1000 m from the pumping well.

24. A well at a distance *d* from an impermeable boundary pumps at a
    flow rate *Q*. The head and any point (*x, y*) is given by the
    following equation:

> *h*(*x*, *y*) *Q*

2p*T*

> \[ln(*r*~1~

*r*~2~)\] + *C*,

> where *C* is a constant, *r*~1~ is the straight-line distance from the
> well to the point (*x, y*), and *r*~2~ is the distance from the image
> well to the point (*x*, *y*). The *y*-axis lies along the impermeable
> boundary. Use Darcy's law to show that the flow across the boundary
> (*y*-axis) is indeed zero.

25. A fully penetrating well pumps from a confined aquifer of thickness
    20 m and *K* = 10 m/day. The radius of the well is 0.25 m and the
    recorded pump rate in the well is 100 m^3^/day at steady state.
    Assume that the radius of influence of the well is 1250 m. Compute
    the drawdown at the well if it is located 100 m from an impermeable
    boundary (see Problem 8.24).

## Design Applications in Hydrology

### ---By James F. Thompson

> Open channel improvements in Houston, Texas.

**9.1**

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> **560**
>
> This chapter addresses many fundamental design applications in
> hydrology that are routinely used in engineering and related analyses.
> The basic design ele- ments of drainage collection systems for
> urbanized areas are presented along with the applications of synthetic
> design storms used in common design and analysis situations. Culvert
> design is presented at a fundamental level, and ap- plications of
> detention basins for peak runoff control are also discussed as ap-
> plied to typical urban developments and improvement projects. Design
> issues applied in floodplain management for the purposes of flood
> damage reduction are discussed, along with an example of various
> stages of applications.
>
> Detailed examples of design applications are presented in this
> chapter, and much of the discussion builds upon other topics in
> hydrology presented in other chapters. Design approaches commonly used
> in engineering applications are described, employing conventional
> hand-calculation methods as well as com- puter modeling using HEC-HMS,
> HEC-RAS, and other software programs.
>
> Typically, a drainage design is initiated based upon a need either for
> facilitat- ing drainage of a particular project area or for improved
> drainage as would be required to address the flood reduction of a
> particular area. Five steps are normally taken in the design of
> drainage collection systems:

1.  Define the drainage areas serving the project area.

2.  Determine the hydrologic response and runoff from these drainage
    > areas, given a particular design or actual storm event.

3.  Design the stormwater conveyance conduits.

4.  Analyze the effects of increased stormwater quantity, if any.

5.  Mitigate any project negative effects.

> Another component commonly included in design relates to stormwa- ter
> quality. Many references address the issue of the management of runoff
> quality. Local or regional jurisdictions usually control the design
> parameters and criteria to be employed for a particular collection
> system.
>
> A typical urban stormwater system consists of streets constructed with
> curbs, gutters, inlets, and roadside ditches; underground storm
> sewers; and open outfall channels such as streams, bayous, and rivers
> receiving runoff. In designing a system, the first basic step is to
> determine the contributing drainage areas to the system, so that the
> runoff may be estimated. This en- tails the development of a drainage
> area map based upon the topography of the project area. Figure 9--1
> illustrates a typical urban setting, upon which a drainage area map
> has been developed to define the contributing drainage areas to storm
> sewer system junctions.
>
> More explicit maps are often prepared delineating the individual
> drain- age areas based upon inlet placement. The drainage area map
> illustrates a simplified layout to be used for design of the storm
> sewer system. Inlet design and placement are critical and are
> discussed later in this chapter. In Figure 9--1, each individual
> drainage area drains to the associated manhole junction (drainage area
> A9 to manhole junction MH-A9, and so on).
>
> The development of a proper drainage area map is a fundamental build-
> ing block of any urban stormwater system. Existing topographic maps
> and other map sources illustrating relative topographic contours may
> be used to develop the map. More advanced methods may be employed,
> such as aerial photography, which is in turn used to develop a digital
> elevation model (DEM). Further developments in remote sensing
> techniques are being applied today, such as light detection and
> ranging (LIDAR), which is used to produce very accurate
> three-dimensional digital maps for use in the development of drainage
> area boundaries. Regardless of the source, it is imperative that the
> drainage area map reflect the true pattern of the surface flow of
> rainfall runoff. Once these patterns and contributing drainage areas
> are known, the quantity of storm water runoff may be determined.
> Chapter 10 presents more details on topographic analysis using
> geographical information systems (GIS).

> Collection systems are designed to convey a particular design storm

> **Rational Method as Applied to Design**
>
> The most commonly used method for determining peak flow rates from a
> given project drainage area is the rational method using the formula
>
> *Q* = (*CA*) . *i* (9--1)
>
> where *Q* is the peak runoff flow in cfs, *C* is the dimensionless
> runoff coeffi- cient, *A* is the drainage area in acres, and *i* is
> the rainfall intensity in inches per hour. The rational method is
> simplistic in that it relies on the basic phys- ical characteristic of
> a drainage area (i.e., size and runoff coefficient) multi- plied by a
> rainfall intensity as based upon the design event being considered.
> The runoff coefficient, *C*, varies dramatically based upon the
> developed state of the drainage area. Table 6--6 lists commonly
> utilized runoff coefficients. Section 6.2 presents more details on the
> rational method.
>
> The rainfall intensity is a function of the return frequency or design
> event and the time of concentration (*Tc*). *Tc* is normally thought
> of as the equilibrium time for rainfall at the most remote part of the
> drainage area to contribute flow at the outlet or design point---in
> other words, how many minutes it takes for a water particle to travel
> the longest distance within a contributing drainage area

> being considered. The basic fundamental assumption of *Tc* in the
> rational method is that the time to peak, *Tp*, is equal to *Tc* and
> that the runoff hydro- graph for a project area has a simplified
> relationship, as shown in Figure 9--3.
>
> A critical function in the rational formula is the rainfall intensity,
> *i.* While specific rainfall intensities can be used for a given
> project area, it is common to use established
> intensity--duration--frequency (IDF) curves. Using sources relating
> total rainfall depth to a rainfall duration period (i.e., 5- to
> 60-minute; and 6-, 12-, and 24-hour, and so on), such as Technical
> Paper No. 40 and Technical Memorandum Hydro 35 from the National
> Weather Service, we may develop IDF curves which relate *Tc*, the
> design event or frequency, and the runoff intensity measured in inches
> per hour. Most major municipalities and state entities have IDF
> curves, or formulas used to create specific IDF curves, readily
> available for use. Furthermore, these same entities typically specify
> the design event to be utilized on a given project. Typical IDF curves
> are illustrated in Figure 9--4.

> **Design of Conveyance Conduits**
>
> Once a design storm is created in compliance with the maximum storm
> fre- quency, the peak flow of that storm can be used to design an

> Closed conduits include all types of sewer systems, including round

> conduits. Drainage-system open channels come in all sizes, from small
> drain- age swales that are only barely noticeable to major open
> channels. Major open channels commonly encountered in floodplain
> management are discussed, from a design standpoint, later in this
> chapter. For drainage collection systems, the most common form of open
> channel encountered is the ordinary roadside ditch. Roadside ditches,
> like closed conduits, come in all sizes.
>
> The actual design of urban storm sewers and open channels, or con-
> duits, is a process of sizing the conveyance conduit to facilitate the
> estimated peak flow rate at that point in the system, considering the
> upstream drainage area(s). In using the rational method, as the
> drainage areas are summed moving downstream along the new or proposed
> storm drainage conduit, *Tc* is naturally increased. This reflects the
> dampening or attenuation of the storm flood wave as it propagates
> downstream through the conduits. To size the conduits themselves, it
> is common to use Manning's equation,

> In parallel with the sizing of the conduits, the relative position of

> achieved by cal- culating the hydraulic grade line (HGL), starting at
> the most downstream point in the system, typically the storm drainage
> system outlet. Sometimes called a backwater calculation, the HGL
> represents the locus of elevations to which the stormwater would rise
> if open to atmospheric pressure, such as within piezometer tubes; it
> can be used to evaluate the adequacy of the de- sign and identify
> areas of potential surface flooding. The difference in eleva- tion of
> the water surface in successive conduit reaches reflects the friction
> and other minor losses in the conduits due to drops and bends,
> assuming gradually varied flow conditions. If the conduit has a slope
> equal to the fric- tion slope, then the HGL will be parallel to the
> conduit. Considering Equa- tion (9--3), the conduit slope, *S*, is
> equal to the friction loss, *h~f~*, divided by the length of conduit,
> *L*, in full-flow conditions, ignoring minor losses. Solving for
> *h~f~*, Equation (9--4) represents Manning's equation as utilized for

> 9--5 illustrates the relationship between the HGL, the EGL, and a
> conduit (in this case a storm sewer pipe). Notice that if the starting
> water surface elevation of the downstream outlet of a conduit is below
> the soffit of the conduit itself, then the conduit may be flowing
> partially full. Conversely, if the outlet is fully submerged, then the
> conduit will be under pressure, at least at the outlet, assuming that

> **EXAMPLE 9--1**
>
> **STORM SEWER COLLECTION SYSTEM DESIGN**
>
> Figure 9--1 shows an actual drainage area map of a project area and
> urban storm sewer layout. Figure 9--4 shows the applicable IDF curves
> for this region, and Equation (9--2) provides a useful method for
> calculating the intensity values. The sizing of conduits for this
> storm sewer can be com- pleted with a typical storm sewer design
> spreadsheet, as shown in Table E9--1(a). Complete the unfinished lines
> (shaded cells) of this spreadsheet (Manhole A6 to A3) using the data
> provided in the table and finish cal- culating the HGL elevations up
> to Manhole A9 in column 24 of the table. This will determine the
> correct size of each conduit needed to accom- modate a given design
> storm and will calculate the HGL or water surface profile of the
> system. Given that this is a new storm sewer system in an existing
> urban area, many of the conduit characteristics are set in order to
> avoid conflicts with existing utilities. In the completion of this
> example, only the conduit size is to be determined as a design
> variable based on the other fixed characteristics (U/S and D/S
> elevations, lengths, and slopes). A minimum of 3 ft/sec shall be used
> in the storm sewer, assuming full-flow conditions in order to maintain
> a minimum self-cleaning velocity in the sewers. Use standard
> reinforced concrete pipe sizes in the design (0.5-ft diameter

>
> **SOLUTION**
>
> Once the fundamentals of the above equations are understood, the
> actual de- sign development is rather straightforward. Referencing
> back to Figure 9--1 as a fundamental basis for the design, proceed
> from upstream to downstream in the calculations of the storm sewer
> sizing. Visualize the connectivity of the system. Line A goes from the
> Outlet to Manhole A9. Line B connects to Line A at Manhole A1 and
> continues up to Manhole B3. The following steps are worked for every
> conduit reach (a conduit reach being from one manhole junc- tion to a
> connecting manhole junction) and apply to all lines in the
> spreadsheet.

1.  Multiply the given *C* coefficient and contributing drainage area
    > for the receiving upstream manhole location. Tabulate the result
    > in column 6.

2.  Sum the combined *C* \* *A* values from the rational method in col-
    > umn 7, thus providing a weighted *C* \* *A* value to account for
    > dif- ferent *C* values along the project route.

> *Note:* For the last row (reach A1 to Outlet), add the upstream
> reaches in Line A and B together for the Total Drainage Area and Sum
> *C* \* *A* (include its own drainage area, 5.42).

3.  Determine the various intensity values from IDF curves or the re-
    > lated intensity formula using the determined *Tc* (in this
    > example, the established *Tc*) and tabulate in column 10.

> *Note:* The Design Storm is a 2-yr, 24-hr event, as stated at the top
> of the spreadsheet.

4.  Calculate the flow rates, *Q*, for each design reach in column 11
    > us- ing Equation (9--1).

5.  At this point the conduit can be sized accordingly. A roughness of

> 0.013 is used, as the conduit shall be reinforced concrete pipe (see
> column 21). In this example, all conduits shall be round pipe and the
> conduit span and rise dimensions (columns 14 and 15) are the same.
> Since the geometry of the storm sewer system is fixed, as described
> above, the design entails finding a suitable pipe size that will meet
> flow and velocity criteria. Two means can be used at this stage to
> design the storm sewer size. The first method can entail the rear-
> rangement of Equation (9--3) to explicitly find the pipe diameter in
> feet, since all other variables are known. Once this is done, the
> nearest larger standard pipe size can be used. The second method is
> simply by trial and error in the spreadsheet (try a size, see if it
> works, and adjust if needed). Both methods, using the explicit cal-
> culation of the conduit size or trial and error, work suitably well.
>
> Remember, there are two basic checks to make when designing every
> conduit size:

(a) Is the capacity of the sewer reach greater than or equal to the
    actual flow (column 22 compared to 11)?

(b) Does the actual velocity of the sewer reach meet or exceed the mini-
    mum 3 ft/sec requirement?

> The design intent is to use the smallest standard-sized reinforced
> concrete pipe that will meet these criteria, because this will provide
> the most cost benefit. In addition, if a conduit is too large for a
> given flow, the actual velocity of the flow in the sewer will be too
> low.

1.  Once the pipeline diameter is determined, use the usual form of
    > Manning's equation \[Eq. (9--3)\] to calculate flow capacity for
    > the designed conduit (column 22). Dividing the actual flow
    > (column 11) by the designed conduit area (column 17) gives the
    > actual velocity in the conduit, assuming full-flow conditions.

2.  After the conduits are sized, it is common then to calculate the HGL
    > or water surface profile of the system. We do so by calcu- lating
    > the friction loss in each storm sewer reach and then add- ing
    > those together, on a reach-by-reach basis, starting at the most
    > downstream known water surface location---in this case, the
    > outlet. Unlike the storm sewer system itself, which is designed
    > from up- stream to downstream, the HGL is determined from
    > downstream to upstream. Minor losses, including manhole junction
    > losses, can be employed for a more accurate HGL computation, but
    > in many instances, and in this example, the minor losses are
    > ignored.

> In closed conduit systems, the friction loss in each reach can be
> found with Equation (9--4). The HGL is formed by adding those losses,
> on a reach- by-reach basis, to the starting water surface elevation at
> the outlet---hence the importance of defining a proper starting water
> surface elevation at the outlet (31.00 ft in this example---see the
> top of the spreadsheet). Given the starting tailwater elevation
> relative to the storm sewers, the sewers are flowing full in this
> example, and the friction loss is computed in a straightforward
> manner, as described above.
>
> In completing the design as stipulated above (using the smallest
> standard- sized reinforced concrete pipe, in half-foot increments,
> that has sufficient ca- pacity and yields at least the minimum
> full-flow velocity required), the design solution for the reaches'
> left bank is tabulated in Table E9--1(b). A profile plot of the storm
> sewer design for Line A is included in Figure 9--7, and im- portant
> considerations of overland flow are discussed following this example.

> The overall way a storm sewer design works hand-in-hand with surface
> drainage features is critical to the performance of the combined
> subsurface and surface drainage components (i.e., the underground
> conduits and the above- ground drainage mechanisms like the surface
> streets). Figure 9--7 is a profile plot of the design results of Line
> A in Example 9--1. Notice that the HGL is suitably below the natural
> ground and street gutter lines, thus indicating that surface flooding
> is not anticipated for that particular design event, assuming the
> inlets are designed adequately, as discussed later in this chapter.
> Also notice that the surface streets are graded to allow for an
> overland flow path of stormwater, in an extreme storm event that would
> exceed the designed capacity of the storm sewer system, to flow to the
> receiving outfall, in this case a bayou, in a cascading fashion over
> the street profile grade line (PGL) high points. Referring both to
> Figures 9--6 and 9--7 gives a visual representation of the
> relationships between the storm sewer design, the position of the HGL
> of the sewer system, and the design of the overland flow mechanisms
> such as the surface streets.
>
> In designing storm sewer systems, it is important to consider the
> effect of the downstream starting water surface elevation at the
> outlet or outfall. The water surface elevation chosen for the outlet
> dictates the regional storm's effect on HGL height in the local
> system. This elevation must have some rela- tion and may be used as
> provided by other studies and analyses or as deter- mined from
> approximations, if acceptable, using normal depth calculations within
> the outlet receiving channel. In many instances, the design criterion
> allows for simplified assumptions pertaining to starting water surface
> eleva- tions at the outlet for the purposes of computing the HGL along
> a designed storm sewer system. This may be the soffit (top or crown)
> of the last reach of pipe at the outlet or even perhaps some arbitrary
> elevation as prescribed by a governing flood control agency. In any
> case, the HGL is computed upstream
>
> throughout the storm sewer system to detect instances where
> significant head loss may exist. Increasing the size of the conduit
> increases the hydraulic radius of the conduit, thereby reducing the
> friction loss and the slope of the HGL. In cases where certain HGL
> criteria must be met, a trial-and-error type of approach is often
> exercised to finalize a design that satisfies the design intent.
>
> **Minor Losses in Storm Sewers**
>
> Manhole and junction losses as well as bend losses may be considered
> in the development of the HGL profile. In some cases, these losses are
> considered minor and insignificant; in other cases, especially where
> relative velocities are rather high, the losses may be considered
> significant and therefore added to the conduit friction losses at the
> junctions. Equation (9--6) represents the equation for the calculation
> of manhole/junction losses. Notice the primary influencing parameter
> in these equations is the velocity term. When the velocity is rather
> low, these losses are indeed very minor (thousandths of a foot);
> however, they do add up and can exacerbate a potential flooding
> problem due to high-HGL problems, such as illustrated in Figure 9--6.
> In general, it is desirable to keep the minimum velocities within
> conduits above 3 feet per second. Maximum veloci- ties should not
> exceed 8 feet per second without due consideration of the use of
> energy-dissipation features to control the effects of high velocities
> such as ero- sion. Again, local design guidelines generally dictate
> this controlling criterion.
>
> In some design circumstances, the friction coefficient, *n*, is used
> to consider the minor losses anticipated. In Example 9--1, had the
> friction coef- ficient been 0.011, a reasonable *n*-value found in
> laboratory case studies, in lieu of the used 0.013 value, the total
> friction loss would have been reduced over 1.5 ft throughout the
> entire Line A system. Hence the *n*-value can be used to aid the
> overall design in terms of trying to more accurately estimate the
> total loss through the system when minor losses (bends, manhole junc-
> tions, and inlet losses) are ignored.
>
> When manhole junction losses are desired to be considered, we may use
> the equation

*h~j~* = *K~j~* a *V*

b (9--6)

> where *h~j~* is the manhole/junction loss without a curved deflector
> (ft), *V* is the velocity through the manhole in ft/sec, *g* =
> gravitational constant (32.2 ft/sec^2^), and *K~j~* is as shown in
> Figure 9--8.
>
> **Inlets Used with Storm Sewers**
>
> Equally important as the design of the conduits is the design of
> inlets and other stormwater capture facilities. An inlet is simply a
> stormwater capture feature that physically receives flow from overland
> sheet flow or more channelized flow such as within a gutter, and the
> importance of properly sized inlets cannot be overstated. After all,

> **DESIGN OF CULVERTS**
>
> **Fundamentals of Culverts**
>
> Culverts are commonly referred to as those conveyance conduits
> constructed within embankments for the purposes of supporting a
> roadway, a railroad, or for the particular functionality of the
> embankment itself, such as would be the case in a levee. Culverts are
> different than storm sewers in that they are typically much shorter
> (although there are cases of long-span culverts) and are exposed at
> both ends to accommodate unobstructed inflow and outflow of storm
> water. The simple culvert crossing of a street connecting two road-
> side ditches is one of the most common culvert applications readily
> identified. Culvert crossings, as they are commonly known, come in all
> shapes and sizes. A variety of materials are often used in culvert
> construction, in a variety of shapes, such as circular, box, and
> elliptical. As needed to convey a given amount of stormwater flow,
> given particular depth requirements, multiple barrels of culverts may
> be used at a single location. While appearing simple, culvert behavior
> and culvert design are deceptively complex.
>
> Referring to Figure 9--10, the factors that affect culvert design
> include the headwater (*HW*), the tailwater (*TW*), the length (*L*),
> the size or diameter (*D*), the slope (*S*), and the friction factor
> (*n*). Many other factors also affect the performance of culverts,
> such as the inlet and outlet geometry, which would include the use of
> headwalls and even the shape of the culvert edges. The basic driving
> culvert design parameter is considered to be the allowable headwater
> depth. After all, the intent of a culvert is to allow stormwater to
> pass through an embankment at a planned rate, which relates to an
> allowable headwater depth on the upstream side of the culvert, given
> an established

> tailwater condition downstream of the culvert. Looking at Figure
> 9--10, the simple balanced equation for comparing the water surface
> elevations on both sides of the culvert is
>
> *HW* + *LS* = *TW* + *H* (9--9)
>
> where *HW* is the upstream headwater at the inlet of the culvert, *LS*
> is the product of the length multiplied by the slope of the culvert,
> *TW* is the down- stream tailwater at the outlet of the culvert, and
> *H* is the total head loss through the culvert, as described in
> further detail below.
>
> Culverts are generally divided into two classifications: **inlet
> controlled** or **outlet controlled**. Inlet-controlled culverts are
> governed by the inlet of the culvert, and the discharge through the
> culvert is predominately affected by the culvert entrance. In a
> simplistic sense, inlet control exists when the discharge through the
> culvert itself can be at a greater rate than what is capable of
> entering into the culvert at the inlet. Inlet-controlled culverts are
> not affected so much by the internal culvert characteristics, such as
> rough- ness and length, as by the headwater depth, entrance geometry
> and configu- ration, and type of inlet edge. Culverts do not flow full
> throughout their entire length under inlet control conditions, and
> generally flows are super- critical in the culverts. If the culvert
> application is in an environment of relatively steep slope, inlet
> control is more likely. Figure 9--11 illustrates an example of
> inlet-control conditions for a culvert; other inlet-control flow
> conditions exist as well (see reference material for a more detailed
> description of other flow conditions).
>
> Inlet control can be somewhat involved in terms of the calculations
> employed due to the partially full-flow conditions of the culvert.
> Many publications document the behavior of culvert conditions in a
> variety of applications. As would be typical, inlet-control conditions
> require the use of tables, charts, nomographs, or other available
> reference materials from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or
> other sources that will aid the designer in defining the behavior of
> the culvert in terms of hydraulic perfor- mance based upon extensive
> research. The design of inlet-controlled culverts can be complex for
> the reasons stated above, and in lieu of using the described published
> culvert behavior tables, charts, and so on, it is common to apply
> readily available software programs, such as HEC-RAS, as described

> culvert play a significant role, as do the tailwater conditions for a
> particular storm event being applied. If the culvert application is in

> however, outlet-control circumstances can exist whereby the culvert
> outlet is not submerged (see reference material for a more detailed

*H*~exit~ = (*V*^2^\>2*g*)~culvert~ - (*V*^2^\>2*g*)~channel~, (9--12)

> **DESIGN OF CULVERT CROSSING**
>
> A new culvert is to be designed and constructed replacing an existing

> 160 acres of park land near Houston, Texas. The design criteria
> require that the culvert be sized such that a 10-yr synthetic design

> go over) the roadway, as shown in Figure E9--2(a). Due to the two-lane

> round pipe culvert exists in this location now and has proven
> inadequate.

(a) Use the rational method with *Tc* = 18 min., *C* = 0.18 (for park
    > land), and the IDF curves shown in Figure 9--4 along with Equa-
    > tion (9--2) for a 10-yr storm.

(b) Establish the tailwater (*TW*) depth in the channel by calculating
    > the normal depth at the downstream end of the culvert using the
    > Manning's equation applied to the channel cross section shown in
    > Figure E9--2(a).

(c) Establish the allowable total head loss, *H*.

(d) Size the culvert using a 3-ft maximum rise or height. Use a square-
    > cut end entrance projecting from the fill of the embankment.

3.  Establish the maximum allowable total head loss, *H*, using the
    > known maximum upstream water surface elevation allowed.

> The culvert is an outlet-control scenario because, given the lim-
> itation of a maximum 3-ft rise or height of our box culvert, the
> outlet is submerged (3 6 4.09), and we have an extremely flat slope
> along the channel (0.002 ft/ft), which will result in a higher *HW*
> relative to the conduit, due to the total head loss through the
> system; therefore, the conduit barrel is under pressure its entire
> length. Additionally, given the slope and flow for the channel, the
> critical depth can be calculated as 2.91 ft (see Chapter 7 for
> description of critical depth), which is below the actual depth of
> flow calculated above, which indicates the flow is subcritical in the
> channel.
>
> The upstream invert or flow-line elevation of the culvert is
>
> 80.0 ft. Therefore, the downstream culvert flowline is 80 - 42(0.002)
> = 79.92 ft,
>
> where 0.002 is the slope of the culvert and 42 is the length of the
> culvert in feet. The *TW* elevation (the downstream water surface
> elevation) is then simply the elevation of the downstream culvert flow
> line plus the normal depth, *d*, of flow in the channel.
>
> *TW* = 79.92 + 4.09 = 84.01 ft.
>
> The maximum *HW* elevation (the upstream water surface eleva- tion) is

4.  Size the culvert.

2.  Create a new geometric data file with 4 cross sections and the cul-
    > vert. In the geometry file, create a River called *Ditch* and a
    > Reach called *Roadway*. Enter 4 cross sections (2 upstream and 2
    > down- stream of the culvert), with river stations 10, 50, 100, and
    > 140.

> **Detention Concepts and Applications**
>
> The basic premise for the use for detention basins within drainage
> collection systems is to reduce the peak discharges to predeveloped or
> preproject con- ditions. In floodplain management design, detention
> basins can have other uses, as will be discussed later within this
> chapter. Detention basins are com- monly used in conjunction with
> other infrastructure improvements, such as with the design of new land
> developments and storm sewer and roadside ditch collection system
> improvements.
>
> The development of an improvement project within an existing water-
> shed can consist of not only the construction of new facilities on raw
> land, but also the alteration of existing impervious levels and
> drainage character- istics in previously developed areas. As such, new
> developments, channel modifications, roadway reconstructions, and
> other common civil works proj- ects may lead to the creation of
> undesirable hydraulic impacts in the form of increased peak runoffs
> from various storm events. The identification, quantification, and
> mitigation of such impacts to receiving outlet channels or conduits
> and adjoining properties have become a primary focus in a typ- ical
> project development life cycle. This is a main activity for design
> engi- neers and engineering hydrologists.

> The alteration of an existing watershed's drainage characteristics, as
> caused by an urban development project, for example, often leads to
> increased flow rates to the receiving outlet or downstream collection
> system. In many cases, these in- creased flow rates equate to rises in
> open-channel water surface elevations or the surcharging of existing
> storm sewer systems, which in turn often di- rectly relate to
> increased levels of surface flooding.
>
> While the elimination or significant reduction of the increase of
> surface flooding is desired, not all increases in flow rates from a
> given project area negatively impact receiving outlet channels or
> closed conduit systems. This would be the case if an outlet system had
> sufficient capacity to facilitate these increased flows without any
> effect or alteration to levels of surface flooding. Considering this
> discussion on various baseline parameters for the identification of
> negative impacts, the term *impact* actually implies *adverse impact*.
> An adverse impact would exist from a project development stand- point
> if the resultant increase in existing runoff flow rates caused by the
> al- teration to the watershed characteristics directly resulted in
> increased surface flooding, erosion, or other such physically damaging
> phenomena. After an improvement project is designed, using either
> advanced or conventional means, the system should be analyzed to
> ascertain if any adverse impacts do indeed exist as a result of the
> new or proposed improvements. If these im- pacts do exist, then
> mitigation measures should be undertaken. Typically, the determination
> and mitigation of hydrologic and hydraulic impacts can entail a rather
> complex analysis utilizing complex tools. Simplified ap- proaches are
> available in urbanized areas where storage coefficients or other such
> watershed parameters have been established to facilitate the develop-
> ment of stormwater management improvements. This may be the case, for
> example, if detention-basin requirements are simplified to a
> per-acre-of- detention-needed vs. the size of a given project area. As
> always, designers are encouraged to check local governing entities for
> such established criteria. A common form of mitigation is the use of a
> detention basin within the project design. There are numerous detailed
> references on detention design, but the basic fundamental sizing of a
> detention basin for the purposes of mitigating increased runoff due to
> a particular project is based on the com- parison of the existing to
> proposed discharge hydrograph at the outlet of the drainage collection
> system. The needed storage volume is determined from the area
> difference under the proposed vs. under the existing hydrograph, as
> illustrated in Figure 9--15. By providing this storage in the
> detention basin and properly sizing the outlet of the basin to govern
> the discharge to the desired predevelopment or preproject conditions,
> the negative effects or impacts of the given improvement project can
> be mitigated to mimic the existing-conditions peak flow rate, as can
> be seen in Figure 9--15. In other words, a properly designed detention
> basin can reduce the peak flow for the project proposed conditions to
> approximate the project existing conditions.

> It should be noted that the volume of runoff, at times, is indeed
> greater in the postproject improvement conditions (i.e., the proposed

> Mitigation measures using detention basins are not easily employed in
> densely developed urban areas. In many cases, available land for
> detention basins either does not exist or is too costly. As is often

>
> **Detention Basin Design**
>
> The actual design process of a detention basin is rather
> straightforward. As mentioned above, some communities already have
> predetermined param- eters for detention basin sizing that are based
> upon percentages of change in imperviousness or other such criteria.
> Given the absence of such prede- termined criteria for design
> purposes, the basic steps in the design of a deten- tion basin are:

1.  Develop the existing-conditions (preproject) runoff hydrograph for
    > the project area.

2.  After designing the drainage collection system or system improve-
    > ments for the project area, develop the proposed-conditions (post-
    > project) runoff hydrograph for the project area.

3.  Comparing the existing- to proposed-conditions hydrographs, deter-
    > mine the detention volume needed to reduce the proposed peak
    > discharge.

4.  Size the detention outlet and basin to use the storage provided and
    > to govern the discharge as desired.

> The above steps are for commonly applied detention basins used in
> conjunction with drainage collection systems. This is known as
> "in-line" detention, whereby the detention basin is actually in line
> with the drainage collection system, typically at the utmost
> downstream end, as connected to the outfall or receiving channel or
> other drainage system. "Off-line" deten- tion systems are commonly
> applied in floodplain management and typically involve side-flow weirs
> for connectivity to the drainage system. Detention basins used with
> drainage collection systems may indeed be off line, whereby the
> project area discharge conduit is restricted to govern the flow of
> discharge and a detention basin is connected to the collection system
> in a lateral sense; hence, it is an off-line basin. Off-line detention
> basins are discussed later in this chapter in conjunction with
> floodplain management design techniques.
>
> Many features and appurtenances are commonly employed in deten- tion
> basins. One such feature is the utilization of a flap gate or pinch
> valve at the outlet to the receiving outfall channel. Such a flap gate
> or similar de- vice prevents backflow into the detention basin as the
> outfall channel rises during a storm event, thereby utilizing the
> storage available in the basin. In some cases, the provision of
> detention storage within the watershed is viewed as a positive feature
> regardless of whether the inflow comes from a project site or from
> backflow from the receiving outfall channel. The use of flap gates or
> pinch valves with detention basins is just one of many design deci-
> sions in project planning. Should such a gate or valve be used, the
> head loss through it is sometimes ignored, as modern gates and valves
> can be specially fitted or even custom made for each application,
> resulting in rather minor losses in their use.

1.  Develop the existing- and proposed-conditions runoff hydro- graphs
    using SCS TR-20 methodology. There are many means of achieving this.
    Chapter 2 includes a brief description of this meth- odology. As
    commonly applied, computer programs are readily available that
    quickly compute runoff hydrographs based on TR- 20 methodology. One
    such program is the WinTR-55 Small Wa- tershed Hydrology program,
    available from the Natural Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS;
    formerly the SCS), a branch of the USDA. WinTR-55 is a single-event
    rainfall--runoff watershed model that uses the TR-20 methodology for
    developing runoff hydrographs \[see Fig. E9--4(b)\]. The program can
    be downloaded directly from the USDA and NRCS website (see Appendix
    E). WinTR-55 computes peak discharges and provides a graphic plot of
    runoff hydrographs. Furthermore, WinTR-55 produces a TR- 20
    hydrograph text output file that can be exported to any spread-
    sheet for use in calculating required storage volumes or for other
    reasons in support of a given design.

> After input of the above data for the existing and proposed
> conditions, WinTR-55 can be run to generate the hydrographs for export
> to a spreadsheet (but the tabular TR-20 hydrograph text
>
> data can be obtained from WinTR-55 and the data can be plotted and
> utilized by hand methods equally as well!).

2.  Within an electronic spreadsheet (or by hand methods), overlay the
    > existing and proposed hydrographs and visualize the impacts of the
    > proposed (postproject) conditions. Measure the area under the
    > proposed-condition curve compared to the existing-condition curve
    > to estimate the storage volume required, as illustrated in Figure
    > E9--4(c). Also, note the maximum existing-condition discharge or
    > runoff from this figure (or taken directly from the WinTR-55
    > output).

3.  Size the outfall pipe for a maximum discharge equal to the existing
    > peak flow at the maximum allowable head differential between the
    > tailwater elevation at the outfall and the maximum allowable water
    > surface elevation in the detention basin. A commonly used equation
    > for the head loss through a culvert flowing full is

> *H~t~* = (1 + *Ke* + 29*n*^2^*L*\>*R*^1.33^)*V*^2^\>2*g*.
>
> However, this requires solving iteratively and calculating *R* and *v*
> repeatedly. For round pipe conduit (the type of conduit that will be
> used for the basin outlet conduit), this equation can be simplified to

4.  Determine the approximate dimensions of the detention basin,
    > assuming the basin to be square with side slopes of 3:1, as shown
    > in Figure E9--4(a). From the figure, the depth of the basin is
    > based on the flow line of the discharge pipe and the design water
    > sur- face elevation of the basin at the top of the emergency
    > spillway, which results in a depth of 15.5 ft (231.00 - 215.50).
    > The required volume was previously determined in step 2. With the
    > depth and volume known, the equation for a pyramidal frustum can

> The resulting dimensions are top side lengths of 306.44 ft and bot-
> tom side lengths of 213.44 ft. However, since the basin would be
> constructed holding depth, side slopes, and top side lengths con-
> stant, and we are starting with an estimate of the required volume, we
> will use top side lengths of 310 ft (slightly larger than the cal-
> culated 306.44 ft) with all other depth (15.5 ft) and slope (3:1)
> information the same. Should this prove inadequate in size in terms of
> the storage provided, we can increase the top side lengths.

5.  With the discharge conduit sized and the dimensions of the basin
    > established, develop a stage--storage--discharge relationship.

> This can also be done in conjunction with developing data for a
> storage-indication curve that will be used in the routing. Each stage
> in the table will have a specified amount of storage, *S* (based on
> the geometry of the basin determined in step 5), a specified discharge
> from the basin, *Q* (based on the differential head between the
> tailwater and stage level in the basin for the conduit sized in step
> 3), and a value for 2*S* Δ*t* + *Q* based on the *Q* and *S* for that
> stage \[see Table E9--4(a)\]. This table will then be used in the
> routing procedure.
>
> *A note of caution at this point about terms:* Chapter 4 gives
> detailed descriptions of the routing procedures used herein, and the
> terms used in the design can become confusing if not man- aged. We
> have an inflow rate into the basin and an outflow rate out of the
> basin, all working integrally with the change in storage in the basin
> itself. The term "discharge" is used to refer to the outflow leaving
> the basin to the outfall channel, and the term "*Q*" is used in the
> tables and figure that follow to refer to this discharge rate. The
> inflow is referred to by "*I*" as utilized in Chapter 4.
>
> In the creation of the table in step 5 above, the elevation data are
> simply tabulated from the flow line of the basin to the emer- gency
> spillway elevation, using an increment of tabulation that will provide
> sufficient detail to determine the behavior of the ba- sin. Experience
> plays a role in making the determination of the increments used. In
> this case, 35 incremental steps in terms of basin elevation were
> chosen to analyze the basin performance. Once the elevations are
> tabulated, then the stage, storage, and basin pool top area are
> calculated for each elevation increment. The discharge is then
> calculated based upon the equations in step 3 above. But note that
> discharge from the basin does not occur until after the basin
> elevation of 223.00 ft is exceeded, since the pool level in the basin
> must exceed the water surface elevation in the outfall channel in
> order for discharge to occur out of the basin. In addition, it should
> be noted that the flap-gate or pinch-valve feature at the end of the
> outlet conduit is keeping inflow from oc- curring back into the basin
> from the outfall channel, which would consume valuable storage in the
> basin. Should such a flap gate or pinch valve not be included in the
> design, the storage needed would have to be above elevation 223.00 ft
> (the design water sur- face elevation in the outfall channel), unless
> governing local cri- teria dictate otherwise.

> Finally, Table E9--4(a) includes a column at the far right that will

    > conduit to determine if the peak outflow and the size of the basin
    > are adequate, using the data developed in the previous steps and
    > the routing procedure described earlier. In this example, there is
    > no reverse flow into the basin from the outfall channel due to the
    > flap-gate or pinch-valve structure, and outflow from the basin
    > into the outfall channel does not occur until the eleva- tion of
    > the water in the basin is greater than the tailwater eleva- tion
    > in the outfall channel. Use the table developed in step 5 to
    > determine the outflow and stage at the end of each routing step.
    > Check the resulting routing to determine if the maximum stage or
    > discharge exceeds design parameters, or if the basin was oversized
    > and can be reduced in size. If either of the design parameters was
    > exceeded, the basin needs to be resized to avoid this.

    > termined time step, Δ*t*, in step 5.

b.  Determine the inflow, *I~n~*~+~ ~1~, from the proposed-conditions
    > hydro- graph or from the output table of the WinTr-55 run above.

c.  Calculate (*I~n~* + *I~n~*~+~ ~1~) by simply summing the inflow at a
    > given time step with the inflow from the previous time step.

d.  Refer to the detailed routing description in Chapter 4, utilizing
    > Equation (4--13) as restated below.

> (*I~n~* + *I~n~*~+~ ~1~) + (2*S~n~*\> Δ*t* - *Q~n~*) = (2*S~n~*~+~
> ~1~\> Δ*t* + *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~).
>
> Note that at the first tabulated time step of 6.20 hr, all inflow,
> discharge, stage, and storage variables are equal to zero. At time
> 6.45 hr, (2*S~n~* Δ*t* - *Q~n~*) = 0 because *S~n~* and *Q~n~* = 0
> (the stor- age and discharge at the previous time step, 6.20 hr).
> Therefore, solving the above equation yields (2*S~n~*~+~ ~1~ Δ*t* +
> *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~) = 0.06 cfs. *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~ is then determined directly
> from the storage-indication curve, interpolating between the data
> points as prepared in step 5. Subsequent time steps are calculated in
> the same fashion.

e.  Next, the storage is computed for each time step by solving
    > *S~n~*~+~ ~1~. Continuing with the step at 6.45 hr,

> (2*S~n~*~+~ ~1~\> Δ*t* + *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~) = 0.06 cfs.
>
> *Q~n~*~+~ ~1~ = 0,
>
> Δ*t* = 15 min = 900 sec.

Therefore,

> *S~n~*~+~ ~1~ = storage = 27 ft^3^.
>
> The calculation is repeated for every time step.

f.  For every known storage value, the stage is determined via inter-
    > polation from Table E9--4(a) created in step 5.

> The results tabulated in Table E9--4(b) demonstrate that the basin
> acts efficiently. The maximum stage elevation of 15.5 ft is not
> exceeded; however, the basin is almost fully utilized (maximum stage
> elevation of 15.02 ft). Notice that no outflow occurs until the
> minimum stage of 7.50 ft is achieved (223.00 ft - 215.50 ft), and in
> actuality the basin would drain out as the outfall channel flood water
> surface elevation recedes to its normal base flow depth. The inflow
> and outflow for the basin plot similarly to that shown in Figure
> E9--4(c). Notice the maximum discharge from the basin is 272.65 cfs,
> which is less than the existing-con- ditions peak discharge of 279
> cfs, thereby indicating a mitigated proposed condition.

> properties and structures occurs for three fun- damental reasons:

1.  The properties and structures are in the floodplain of a given storm
    > event. In other words, they are simply too close to the channel or
    > within the channel's associated natural flood-prone areas;

2.  The channel's flood level for a given storm event has risen due to
    > increased development of the surrounding community, such that more
    > peak runoff discharges result in higher water surface elevations
    > in the channel; or,

3.  A combination of the above two.

>
> 2\) detention. Channel improvement is simply increasing the conveyance

> Detention basin types---in-line and off-line---were described earlier.
> Figure 9--17 illustrates commonly applied in-line and off-line
> detention basin designs. Example 9--4 describes a relatively small
> in-line basin at the end of a drainage collection system. In-line
> basins can be effectively constructed by simply widening a channel to
> provide more storage at a planned location; however, in large-scale
> open-channel or river projects, in-line basins often need to be
> substantial in size to provide the desired effects. A large dam and
> reservoir in a river system is an example of a very large in-line
> basin, al- though technically it is a *retention* basin, as the basin
> itself---in this case the reservoir---actually is intended to *retain*
> water at all times. In-line detention basins for common larger flood
> control projects usually involve a large levee- and-dam system
> integrated in-line with a natural channel system. As a flood event
> occurs, the flood waters are detained behind the levee-and-dam sys-

> flood waters downstream. This is similar to the applied concepts used

> The second fundamental type of detention basin commonly utilized, an

> **Flood Damage Reduction Design Using HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS**
>
> A fundamental hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and design process in-
> tended to address the impacts of urbanization on a watershed is the
> develop- ment of flood damage reduction (FDR) projects. FDR can take
> many forms, ranging from structural solutions, such as channelization
> and detention to reduce water surface elevations, to nonstructural
> solutions, such as buyouts of homes to reduce damages caused by the
> high water surface elevations. Combinations of structural and
> nonstructural activities are often the most cost-effective solutions.
> Simply employing channel improvements to reduce water surface
> elevations and thereby alleviate flooding in one particular location
> or area can exacerbate flooding in other areas. This is generally due
> to the routing of previously stored flood waters downstream, as
> described previously within this chapter and in Chapter 12. An
> important process in an overall FDR analysis and design is to fully
> understand the behavior and response of the watershed, given the
> existing conditions and any planned improvements to reduce flood
> damage.
>
> There are many tools for developing reductions in water surface eleva-
> tions that yield flood damage reduction benefits. Some of the most
> readily
>
> available and commonly used are the HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS computer
> programs introduced in previous chapters. HEC-HMS can be readily used
> to evaluate the hydrology of a given watershed to examine the affects
> of development and urbanization. HEC-RAS can be used to efficiently
> model the behavior of a given channel or river system and then
> evaluate several design scenarios to provide reductions in water
> surface elevations. For de- tention basin design, HEC-RAS along with
> HEC-HMS can be utilized for full routing and the development of
> storage--discharge relationships, or HEC-RAS can be used in the
> unsteady simulation mode, whereby a known hydrograph is routed along a
> channel system in conjunction with a deten- tion basin.
>
> As the best way to illustrate the process described above, the
> following example is presented in stages that build upon one another
> in the develop- ment of an actual FDR design scenario.

> Stage 2: Existing-conditions HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS analysis to

> peak WSEL. These channel modifications, however, cause the peak
> outflow from this reach of channel to increase from 3801 cfs to 4267
> cfs, about 12%. At the same time, the storage in the overbanks is
> reduced from about 440 ac-ft to 0 ac-ft, as there is no flow or
> storage in the proposed overbank regions, while the volume below the
> new channel banks is increased from about 200 ac-ft to about 307
> ac-ft. This increase in flow rate and the corresponding total
> reduction in storage of about 333 ac-ft will cause a significant
> impact down- stream of this section of channel, as previously
> described in this chapter. In an actual detailed project situation,
> the downstream channel (or receiving stream) would be modeled as part
> of this study to determine whether there is no adverse impact. For
> this example, we will assume that if the peak flow rate can be reduced
> back to the Existing-conditions rate of 3801 cfs from 4267 cfs, the
> impacts of the channel modifications will have been fully miti- gated.
> The above steady-state analysis can be expanded to include unsteady
> state as shown below, but this presents a more complex solution.
>
> **Stage 4: Mitigated Proposed Conditions with an Off-Line Detention
> Basin**
>
> The final stage of the example is the introduction of an off-line
> detention basin, similar to the one illustrated in Figure 9--17, to
> mitigate the impacts of the channel improvement modifications
> introduced in Stage 3. Detention basins can be modeled by several
> methods, including steady-state diversion and detention in HEC-HMS. In
> this analysis, we use a more sophisticated unsteady modeling
> application in HEC-RAS to provide a view of advanced design
> techniques. A main benefit of using unsteady HEC-RAS at this point is
> that once the unsteady flow data is entered into the model, a large
> number of trials can be easily run to examine the behavior of a
> detention basin in various configurations and sizes. All of the
> channel and detention basin routing is performed in HEC-RAS. To ensure
> the best comparison between conditions with and without the detention
> basin, Existing condi- tions are also modeled in HEC-RAS
> unsteady-state mode.
>
> The detention basin is to be a peak "cut-off" or "shaving" basin, as
> previously described in this section, designed to reduce the peak
> outflow
>
> in a channel by removing water from the top of the hydrograph. An off-
> line detention basin, like that shown in Figure 9--17, with a
> side-flow weir will perform this task most efficiently, as the basin
> will not begin to fill until the hydrograph is already rising, and
> will, if designed properly, reduce the peak flow rate downstream of
> the basin.
>
> For the unsteady HEC-RAS model, several changes to the Existing-
> conditions geometry are necessary. None of them change the results
> when run with the steady-flow profiles. First, some cross sections
> need to be inter- polated, with a maximum spacing of 500 ft, to
> improve model stability, allow for assignments of flows along the
> channel, and allow for the placement of the detention basin. HEC-RAS
> cross-section interpolation assumes that there are linear changes
> between the end cross sections and allows the user to determine which
> points along the channel are 'equivalent.' For this exam- ple, since
> the original cross sections are the same, all of the interpolated
> cross sections will have exactly the same shape, but will be shifted
> vertically, and the distances between the cross sections will be
> adjusted. When interpolating cross sections, the user enters a maximum
> spacing, and HEC-RAS calculates the largest spacing for an equally
> spaced set of interpolated cross sections just closer together than
> that maximum. Reach stations for the new cross sections are calculated
> from the upstream and downstream reach stations, and interpolated
> cross sections are marked with an asterisk (\*) at the end of their
> names. There must be two cross sections between most boundary con-
> ditions, such as bridges, weirs, lateral structures, and the upstream
> and downstream ends of river reaches, so more cross sections than
> actually nec- essary were used to allow the detention basin to be
> placed closer to the end of the channel. The results of the
> cross-section interpolation and the addition of the off-line detention
> basin are illustrated in Figure E9--5(j).
>
> All of the routing in the unsteady model will be performed by unsteady
> HEC-RAS, thus eliminating the SvsQ iterations necessary with the
> steady- flow models. The outflows from the Upstream and Downstream
> subbasins will be applied at the appropriate locations along the
> channel. Since the outflow from the subbasins for Existing and
> Proposed is the same for developed conditions, flows from either one
> can be used for the unsteady analyses. The Upstream subbasin's flow
> should be applied at the upstream end as a flow hydrograph, and the
> Downstream subbasin's flow should be applied as a uniform lateral
> inflow hydrograph between RS 2.21538\* and RS 0.184616\*. The
> downstream boundary condition will be normal depth at a slope of
> 0.00075 ft/ft. When these changes are made, the unsteady
> Existing-conditions model can be run. The resulting model has a down-
> stream WSEL of 21.60 ft, which is 0.16 ft lower than the downstream
> WSEL in the steady-state model. The unsteady model's peak flow rate is
> 3704 cfs, which is about 100 cfs lower than the flow rate from the
> steady-state model. It is typical for unsteady models to differ
> slightly from their steady counterparts due to changes in routing and
> timing of the hydrographs. These

> **SUMMARY**
>
> Chapter 9 presents design applications in hydrology with detailed
> explanations, giv- ing examples of the design procedures commonly used
> in urban, rural, and floodplain hydrology applications. The design
> development of drainage collection systems using the rational method
> is presented along with the application of synthetic design storms.
> The design explanation continues with the presentation of the concepts
> of overland flows combined with underground conveyance systems. This
> is a very com- plex subject, as it involves the dynamic nature of
> urban storm water management. Example 9--1 provides a detailed example
> of the design of an urban storm sewer reconstruction project, and the
> HGL is developed and plotted in Figure 9--7 to il- lustrate the
> completed design; however, a more detailed design including the design
> of street inlets would usually be performed. Minor losses for storm
> sewers as well as the behavior of inlets are discussed at the
> conclusion of Section 9.2.
>
> In Section 9.3 the theory of culvert behavior is presented, and
> Example 9--2 is a detailed example using hand calculation methods for
> a culvert under outlet control.
>
> There is much more information on culvert analysis and design, and
> other reference sources are identified to develop a better
> understanding of culverts. More complex culvert design and analysis is
> presented, and an example of a culvert under inlet control modeled
> using HEC-RAS is included. Considering the impacts of urbaniza- tion,
> detention basin design is included in Section 9.4 along with a
> detailed example. The procedures in this example can be input into a
> spreadsheet as a convenient tool for detention basin sizing. In
> Section 9.5 floodplain management design issues are presented with a
> complete flood damage reduction project example. It is required that
> the user of this final example be rather familiar with HEC-HMS and
> RAS, as the various steps use this software extensively. The unsteady
> HEC-RAS modeling techniques presented in Example 9--5 are very much
> real applications, and they pro- vide an excellent opportunity for the
> user to understand the relationships of storage and routing in
> floodplain management design and analysis.

1.  Confirm the data for a 10-yr storm from Equation (9--2) and Table
    9--2 for 10-min, 15-min, 30-min, and 60-min durations. Compare to
    Figure 9--4.

2.  Construct the 100-yr, 24-hr synthetic design hyetograph using
    Equation (9--2) and 1-hr time intervals. Center the maximum
    intensity (the 1-hr intensity) at hr 12; the next highest intensity
    (determined by the depth from 2 hr - 1 hr over the 1-hr
    interval---hence, intensity) at hr 11; the next-highest intensity
    (depth from 3 hr - 2 hr) at hr 13; the next-highest intensity (depth
    from 4 hr - 3 hr) at hr 10; and back and forth similarly. Check the
    total volume under the hyeto- graph and see that it matches the
    total rainfall depth.

3.  Determine the runoff *Q* using Equation (9--1) for a project with
    *A* = 30 ac, *C* = 0.65, *Tc* = 12 min, and an *i*-value developed
    from Equation (9--2) for a 5-yr design storm.

4.  Determine the smallest required concrete round pipe and rectangular
    box sewers for *Q* = 125, 175, 225, and 275 cfs, *S* = 0.005 ft/ft,
    and *n* = 0.013 using Equation (9--3). Tabulate results and compare
    capacities and areas of the round to box sew- ers. Use standard
    increment sizes of 0.5 ft for round pipe and 1.0 ft for box sewers.

5.  Derive Equation (9--4) from Equation (9--3).

6.  For a *Q* = 100 cfs, calculate the *h~f~* = for a 3.5-ft-diameter,
    500-ft-long, round pipe sewer with *n* = 0.012 flowing full.

7.  Using the same flow and the same 500-ft-long round pipe sewer as in
    Problem 9.6, determine and plot the HGL and EGL for the sewer reach,
    given the fol- lowing additional information: U/S pipe invert
    elevation = 100.00 ft; D\>S pipe invert elevation = 96.00 ft; and
    the tailwater elevation for the sewer (i.e., the outlet water
    surface elevation) = 106.00 ft.

8.  Referring to Table E9--1(a), double the flows in Column 11 for each
    sewer reach and determine the minimum commercially available
    concrete box sizes required (available in 1.0-ft increments) for
    each sewer reach using a minimum box span and rise of 2.0 ft. Keep
    all elevation, length, slope, and roughness data the same as
    presented in the table. After sizing the box sewers, recompute the

> **PROBLEMS**
>
> HGL for the entire system. Evaluate any problems with maintaining a
> mini- mum actual velocity of 3 fps.

9.  Calculate the manhole losses, *h~j~*, of 90-, 60-, 45-, 30-, and
    > 15-degree manhole junctions with no special deflector for a
    > 4.5-ft-diameter round pipe sewer flow- ing full with *Q* = 150
    > cfs. Tabulate and compare the results.

10. Given the inlet in Figure 9--9 with *h* = 0.5 ft and *W* = 1.5 ft,
    > determine what minimum length, *L*, of inlet (in whole-foot
    > increments) is required for *Q* = 8 cfs, such that the depth of
    > flow at the curb does not exceed 0.5 ft.

11. Given the inlet in Figure 9--9 with *h* = 0.5 ft, *W* = 1.5 ft, *L*
    > = 4.0 ft, and a gutter depression depth = 0.33 ft, determine what
    > is the *Q* into the inlet if the depth of storm water at the curb
    > is 1.0 ft (i.e., there is 6 inches of water depth above the
    > standard curb height of 6 inches for a total depth at curb of 1.0
    > ft).

12. Repeat Example 9--2 using 3-ft-diameter round corrugated metal pipe
    > culverts with an *n* = 0.024. Determine the minimum number of
    > culvert barrels needed to convey the flow without overtopping the
    > roadway.

13. Repeat Example 9--3 using HEC-RAS but use a 100-yr storm at this
    > location. Recalculate *Q* for a 100-yr storm using the same *C*,
    > *A*, and *Tc* information provided in Example 9--2. Evaluate the
    > behavior of the 7 \* 3 box culvert and then examine the behavior
    > of a 6 \* 3 box culvert at this location. Document the differences
    > in culvert performance, including weir flow depths for com-
    > parative purposes. Determine the minimum span (width) of box
    > culvert needed to prevent overtopping of the roadway if the box
    > culvert rise (height) allowed is increased to 4 ft.

14. Repeat Example 9--4 but with the following changes to the data:

    a.  SCS TR-20 methodology data

        i.  Existing (preproject) *Tc* = 1.3 hr; changed from 1.0 hr

        ii. Proposed (postproject) *Tc* = 0.4 hr; changed from 0.45 hr

    b.  Figure E9--4(a) data

        i.  Emergency spillway and basin design elevation = 229.50 ft;
            > changed from 231.00 ft

        ii. Maximum basin depth = 14.0 ft (229.50 - 215.50); changed
            > from

> 15.5 ft
>
> All other data and information remain unchanged.

15. Repeat Example 9--5 using the same data except that the two
    > subbasins (Up- stream and Downstream) are 2.85 mi^2^ each now
    > (changed from 2.0 mi^2^ each). All other data remain unchanged.
    > This will necessitate extending the existing overbank regions of
    > the Preexisting- and Existing-conditions cross sections along the
    > same slopes to properly analyze the behavior of the channel in
    > steps 1 and 2. In step 3, increase the bottom width of the
    > Proposed cross section beyond 10 ft, keeping the same 4:1 side
    > cross slopes, until the flow is contained within the channel
    > banks. Adjust the weir and detention basin geometry as needed in
    > step 4 to fully mitigate the impacts, as described in the example.

**INTRODUCTION**

**TO GIS**

> **628**
>
> A geographical information system (GIS) includes: (1) attribute or
> feature information in a database format, (2) locational information
> for these attri- butes or features, and (3) analysis functions for
> deriving new information on spatial relationships. GIS has a wide
> application in a variety of civil and environmental applications,
> including demography, meteorology, transpor- tation, urban planning,
> and hydrology. In the past three decades, hydrologic applications have
> been revolutionized by GIS, making it an indispensable technology for
> digital terrain and hydrologic analysis of watersheds. The role and
> usage of GIS technology, software, data formats, and sources of
> geospa- tial data are essential to hydrologic analysis as covered in
> this chapter.
>
> Common to all definitions of a GIS is the concept of linking data with
> a geographical location, which is the definition of **spatial data**.
> Attributes within the context of GIS refer to the characteristic(s)
> mapped at a specific location. For example, attributes could be the
> population and demographics in a city block, or the slope of the land
> surface, or the land use for a given area. Successful use and adoption
> of GIS technology for any purpose depends on factors that extend
> beyond the data and the computer on which
>
> they reside. Effective use of a GIS system requires resources devoted
> to the computer hardware, GIS software, and user training in data
> characteristics and spatial analysis techniques. This chapter
> describes the background and use of GIS in hydrologic analysis and
> relates common GIS terminology and functions to specific hydrologic
> applications.
>
> A GIS can record observations or measurements, which can be thought of
> as **features**, **activities**, or **events**. A **feature** is a
> term used in digital cartography to refer to an item or piece of
> information placed on a map. Point features such as rain gages or a
> benchmark have location with no dimension (0-D), while line features
> such as a watershed boundary or river have several locations strung
> together to form an ordered sequence of points that are
> one-dimensional in space (1-D). Area features, such as the area
> representing a watershed or floodplain boundary, consist of lines that
> form a closed polygon, i.e., a two-dimensional feature (2-D). Besides
> phys- ical features, human **activities** are often described with
> geographical pat- terns and spatial distributions. Population maps,
> census maps, and urban infrastructure maps, e.g., sewers and water
> distribution networks, are exam- ples of human activities that can be
> mapped within a GIS. The temporal dimension of GIS data requires a
> definition of *when* something occurred, termed an event. Mitchell
> (1999) defines an **event** as something that occurs at a point in
> time and can be mapped over time. For example, a GIS data- base
> containing a time series of rainfall values at a point or over a
> watershed can be used to identify the accumulation of rainfall depth,
> duration and intensity in the selected time interval, summation during
> storm event, or long-term amounts such as annual precipitation. A GIS
> database containing spatial location, attributes, and temporal records
> supports queries and anal- ysis of the spatial and temporal dimension
> of hydrologic quantities such as rainfall.
>
> Ian McHarg (McHarg, 1995) popularized the use of GIS in landscape
> design in the 1970s. Its employment in census and population
> demographics and geography or urban planning disciplines gained
> recognition before its application to hydrology evolved. Like the
> adoption of electronic spread- sheet technology, first developed for
> accountants, and later used extensively in other scientific and
> engineering analysis, the application of GIS began in geography and
> has rapidly been adopted by other scientific disciplines. GIS is
> widespread and established in hydrologic applications, for which its
> accep- tance and growth were accelerated by the availability of:

-   Worldwide geospatial data, such as soils, topography, and land use/
    > cover

-   Inexpensive computer hardware capable of performing complex and
    > detailed computations

-   Training and education targeted to the engineering community

-   Generally available GIS software with extensions tailored for hydro-
    > logic analysis

> Active involvement in hydrology by the GIS community is represented
> today by user groups devoted to GIS technology applications to
> hydrology, natural resources management, or urban planning. National
> hydrographic and elevation datasets are available from the U.S.
> Geological Survey (USGS), digital soils data from the Natural
> Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and abundant other spatial data
> formatted for GIS use are avail- able from other federal and state
> agencies. Universities introduced GIS training into their engineering
> curricula to bridge the gap between technol- ogy and education, and
> technology centers offer training for technicians that can perform
> routine GIS functions.
>
> In hydrology, GIS is used for watershed delineation, runoff estima-
> tion, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, and floodplain mapping.
> Digital representation of topography, soils, land use/cover, and
> precipitation may be accomplished using GIS data and methodology.
> These applications are enhanced through the use of GIS, because
> hydrology is inherently spatial in nature.
>
> Data types can differ, depending on the scale at which survey data and
> public GIS data are collected and compiled. The resolution and spatial
> detail found in generally available geospatial data may be appropriate
> for hydro- logic applications when dealing with large basins. However,
> in smaller water- sheds, the scale, spatial detail, and resolution may
> not be sufficient. Considerations of map scale and resolution are
> presented in Vieux and Thompson (2004) along with the standards for
> scale and resolution of GIS, remotely sensed imagery, and surveyed
> data collected for a variety of appli- cations including hydrology.
>
> The sections that follow provide an introduction to GIS concepts, data
> structures, geographic projections, and spatial analysis techniques
> applicable to hydrology. Further details may be found in the excellent
> textbooks and references mentioned and through online sources (see
> Appendix E).

**10.2**

> **GENERAL GIS CONCEPTS**
>
> Data used in GIS generally have a structure and coordinate system that
> is formed from **vector segments**, e.g., lines, points, or polygons;
> or is composed of a regular array of rectangular grid cells referred
> to as a **raster**. For exam- ple, digital representation of land
> surface elevations may be in the form of contour lines (vectors) or of
> a grid of elevations at regularly spaced intervals (raster format).
> The coordinate system used to locate vector or raster data is
> referenced to the earth surface so that the distance between features
> and spatial relationships between them can be derived. Data
> structures, map scale and spatial detail, datum issues, and coordinate
> systems are general concepts needed for understanding GIS usage and
> application to hydrology. A basic understanding of these issues is
> necessary to effectively utilize GIS systems for analysis of
> hydrologic information. Each of these topics is dis- cussed below in
> further detail.
>
> **Raster and Vector Data**
>
> GIS data are usually formatted in a **vector** or **raster**
> structure. A vector dataset maps a geographic feature using lines
> drawn between points or coor- dinate pairs. An advantage of vector
> formats is that a database containing multiple attributes may be
> associated with any given point, line, or polygon, whereas in the
> raster format only a single attribute is usually associated with a
> grid cell. Vector data are used to show rain gages as points, streams
> as lines, and the watershed boundary as a polygon in Figure 10--1
> (left). On the right, a raster of grid cells represents rainfall in
> relation to the watershed and other features in the map. Vector format
> supports the ability to store topology of the data, which defines the
> order and relationship among vector data. For example, a vector data
> structure containing topologic information could be used to represent
> a stream network within a watershed. A GIS system con- taining the
> data could be used to query and search for all downstream seg- ments
> affected by a spill or discharge of pollutants within the stream
> network. Raster data are used to describe spatially continuous
> information and are usually sampled on a regularly spaced grid, as
> seen in Figure 10--1 (right). Examples of raster datasets are digital
> elevation models (DEMs), gridded radar rainfall data, or land uses
> from satellite imagery. The vertical resolu- tion of the data and the
> reliability of the resulting delineated stream network for watersheds
> are described by Gyasi-Agyei et al. (2006).

> height="1.203124453193351in"}In many hydrologic applications of GIS, a
> combination of both vector and raster data is needed, depending on the
> specific application or data source. For example, mathematical and/or
> feature manipulation of two datasets to create a new dataset could be
> used to derive rainfall estimates over a watershed. The intersection
> of NEXRAD radar data (raster) and subwatershed delineations (vector)
> can be performed to calculate rainfall depth over each subwatershed.

> Spatial analysis tech- niques such as intersection, union,
> mathematical computation, buffer generation, dissolving boundaries,
> tabular data analyses, network analyses, and digital terrain modeling
> make GIS indispensable in hydrology as in many other disciplines. Such
> spatial operations create new knowledge about relationships between
> data layers.
>
> **Map Scale and Spatial Detail**
>
> The scale and resolution at which the data are collected or measured
> on a map is termed the **native scale** or resolution. Unlike paper
> maps, map scale is easily altered within a GIS system. Therefore, a
> distinction should be drawn between the inherent or native scale of
> the data and the displayed or printed scale. If the spot or point
> elevations are surveyed in the field on a grid of 100 m, then this is
> its native resolution. Once contours are interpo- lated between the
> points and plotted on a paper map, a native scale of the data is
> introduced. For example, if a paper USGS quad sheet is digitized, the
> native scale will be 1:24,000. As a result, performing an analysis of
> this data at a 1:1000 scale could adversely influence the accuracy of
> the analysis.
>
> A small-scale map is one in which features appear small. For instance,
> maps at 1:1,000,000 have the advantage of covering large areas, but
> show few details. Conversely, large-scale maps have features that
> appear large and show significantly more detail. A topographic map can
> be shown at any scale within a GIS, depending on the needs of the
> application, provided one does not exceed the accuracy supported by
> the data.
>
> **Datum and Spheroid**
>
> Geodesy is the branch of applied mathematics concerned with
> determining the size and shape of the earth and the exact positions of
> points on its sur- face. The earth is often treated as a sphere to
> make mathematical calcula- tions easier, but it is actually a
> **spheroid**. The earth must be treated as a spheroid to maintain
> accuracy in maps of large spatial extent, and a number of standard
> spheroids are commonly used to describe its shape. In North America,
> these include the Clarke 1866 Spheroid and the GRS80 (Geodetic
> Reference System of 1980).
>
> A horizontal datum is a reference frame used to measure locations on
> the surface of the earth. It defines the origin and orientation of the
> lines of latitude and longitude. A horizontal datum is always related
> to a specific spheroid. There are two types of datums: earth centered
> (geocentric) and local. A local datum is aligned so that it closely
> corresponds to the earth's surface for a particular area, such as the
> 1927 North American Datum (NAD27). This datum uses the Clarke 1866
> Spheroid, which passes through Meades Ranch, Kansas. Each point on the
> earth's surface can be defined with a latitude--longitude coordinate
> pair. Latitude and longitude represent
>
> the angles (N-S and E-W) to that point from the center of the earth.
> Stan- dard latitudes and longitudes used over the globe are then
> measured from the center of this spheroid, which does not necessarily
> correspond with the center of mass of the earth. The Clarke 1866
> Spheroid and NAD27 fit North America fairly well, but are not accurate
> for other continents. An earth- centered datum, such as the 1983 North
> American Datum (NAD83), is based on the GRS80 spheroid centered at the
> mass center of the earth, and is therefore more accurate for maps of
> larger extent than North America. The national geodetic survey is
> responsible for establishing geodetic datums (see www.ngs.noaa.gov).
>
> From a vertical standpoint, land elevation is measured from a theo-
> retical surface called mean sea level, which is the elevation that the
> ocean would adopt if it uniformly covered the earth. Because mean sea
> level can- not be defined inland, a geoid is used as a vertical
> reference. The geoid is a surface of constant gravitational
> acceleration (g) over the earth. However, there are problems
> delineating the geoid due to gravitational anomalies, of which maps
> have been prepared and are constantly being improved. For North
> America, the standard vertical datums are the National Geodetic
> Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29) and the North American Vertical Datum
> of 1988 (NAVD88). Care should be exercised when using geospatial data
> compiled in different datums. Geospatial data in one datum must be
> adjusted through reprojection to be consistent with features mapped in
> another datum. The datum used to compile data and maps in a GIS should
> be documented to avoid problems associated with inconsistent vertical
> and horizontal datums.
>
> **Geographic and Cartesian Coordinate Systems**
>
> A geographic coordinate system is based on latitude and longitude, as
> defined above. A transformation or **projection** from a curved
> geographic coordinate system to a Cartesian coordinate system is
> necessary to view all or part of the earth as a flat map. Because it
> is impossible to represent a three-dimensional figure such as the
> earth as a two-dimensional map with minimal distortion, various
> projections have been developed to pre- serve one or more of the
> following properties: shape, area, distance, and direction.
>
> In choosing a projection, we seek to minimize the distortion in one or
> more of the above properties, depending on which aspect is more

> **DIGITAL REPRESENTATION HYDROLOGIC PARAMETERS**
>
> Parameters of importance to hydrologists that can be derived from
> digital data sources include rainfall, infiltration,
> evapotranspiration, and hydraulic roughness. Rainfall may be
> represented as a time series at a point measured at a gage, as a
> radial-polar array or a gridded array of rainfall rates derived from
> radar or isohyetal contours. Infiltration rates, derived from soil
> maps, are generalized over the polygon describing the soil-mapping
> unit. Land use/ cover may be used to develop evapotranspiration rates
> or estimates of hydraulic roughness from polygonal areas or from a
> raster array of remotely sensed surrogate measures.
>
> A dataset may be based on either a direct measure of the physical
> characteristics or an indirect (surrogate) measure requiring
> conversion or interpretation. An example of an indirect measurement is
> NEXRAD's esti- mation of rainfall from radar reflectivity. Chapter 11
> has a more detailed discussion of using NEXRAD rainfall for hydrologic
> applications.
>
> **Soil Type**
>
> Computation of direct runoff requires an estimate of infiltration
> character- istics for the different soil types in a drainage area.
> Soil-type data are widely available for the United States and can be
> downloaded from the Natural
>
> Resources Conservation Service at
> [www.nrcs.usda.gov.](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/) A **soil-mapping
> unit** is the smallest unit on a soil map that can be assigned a set
> of representative properties. Soil maps and the associated soil
> properties form a major source of data for estimating infiltration.
> Some adjustment is inevitable when esti- mating infiltration
> parameters from generalized soils databases for hydro- logic modeling.
> Obtaining infiltration parameters from soil properties requires
> reclassification of the soil-mapping unit into a parameter meaning-
> ful to the hydrologic model.
>
> **Land Use/Cover**
>
> The land surface condition can affect hydrologic processes such as
> runoff and evapotranspiration. A GIS map of the land use and
> associated cover is an important descriptor of the hydrology, whether
> it is vegetative, such as pasture or forest, or the surface is
> modified with asphalt or concrete pave- ment. Land use and land cover
> (LULC) GIS data are compiled for many applications and may be useful
> for hydrologic modeling. Digital LULC maps, derived from direct
> observation or remotely sensed data or digitized from paper LULC
> classification maps, can be used to develop hydrologic parameters such
> as hydraulic roughness, albedo, or aerodynamic roughness height, which
> influences evapotranspiration.
>
> General-purpose LULC maps may or may not contain sufficient detail or
> classification to be useful for deriving hydrologic model parameters.
> LULC maps and the classification scheme are generally not developed
> for hydrologic purposes. For example, in Figure 10--5 there is
> discrimination between pasture and cropland; however, the Anderson
> classification scheme used in USGS LULC maps makes no distinction
> between these two catego- ries (Table 10--1). In terms of runoff rate
> or evapotranspiration, these two categories may behave differently. In
> any case, the hydrologist must exercise judgment when interpreting
> generalized land use categories for purposes of hydrologic modeling.
>
> Hydraulic roughness is a parameter that controls the rate of runoff
> over the land surface. Classification codes from the Anderson
> classification scheme are listed in Table 10--1 with second-level
> categories indented below the major categories. Maps of hydraulic
> roughness can be derived using a lookup table that relates hydraulic
> roughness (see for example, Table 4-2) to the LULC classification
> scheme (Vieux, 2004). Simple reclassification of a LULC map into
> hydraulic roughness represents the deterministic varia- tion. Other
> sources of LULC may include remotely sensed data. In either case, a
> lookup table transforms the LULC into a map of hydraulic rough- ness
> parameters. On-site experience and published values are helpful in

> **DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF TOPOGRAPHY**
>
> Topography plays an important role in the distribution and flux of
> water in natural and man-made systems. The automated extraction of
> topographic parameters from **digital terrain models (DTMs)** using
> GIS is currently rec- ognized as a viable alternative to traditional
> surveys and manual evaluation of topographic maps (Moore et al., 1991;
> Martz and Garbrecht, 1992). A DTM is any digital representation of the
> terrain, such as a series of point elevations, contour lines, and
> triangular facets, composing a **triangulated irregular network
> (TIN)**, also known as a **digital elevation model (DEM)**.
>
> **Contours**
>
> Many existing paper maps (USGS 7^1^-minute quadrangle series) use
> contours to describe the topography. An **elevation contour** is a
> line connecting the points on the earth's surface having the same
> elevation. Representation of
>
> a surface using contours shows gradients and relative minima and
> maxima. Many of the original DEMs produced by the USGS were generated
> by linear interpolation of digitized contour maps. The USGS elevation
> contours have intervals and errors that may be larger than those
> associated with surveyed contours used in civil engineering site
> development. However, even though the elevations may be uncertain,
> fail to show topographic detail, and contain vertical/horizontal
> errors, the contour data can be useful for preliminary delineation of
> watershed areas and computation of channel slope for hydro- logic
> analysis.
>
> **Digital Elevation**
>
> One of the most useful types of geospatial data is digital terrain.
> Useful hydrologic quantities can be derived from a DEM. Other terrain
> attri- butes such as slope and drainage direction are derived from a
> DEM. A model of terrain traditionally relies on contours of equal
> elevation that define watershed boundaries, channel slope, and other
> features. Within a GIS, representation of terrain can be accomplished
> with contours, gridded elevations (also known as a raster DEM), and
> triangular irregular net- works (TIN). Watershed characteristics such
> as slope and drainage length can be derived from a digital model of
> the terrain. A **raster DEM** consists of an array of numbers
> representing the spatial distribution of elevations. It may consist of
> elevations sampled at discrete points or the average elevation over a
> specified segment of the landscape---usually the former. Raster DEMs
> are one of the most widely used elevation data structures because of
> the ease with which computer algorithms are implemented using
> grid-based data.
>
> Digital elevation data are acquired through a technique that relies on
> aerial photography to produce a stereographic image. With survey
> controls to establish horizontal and vertical position (elevation),
> contours are produced from the stereographic images. Interpolation of
> elevation from the contours results in a regularly sampled grid of
> elevations, which are then used to define watershed drainage areas and
> other derivative quantities. Recent advances in laser altimetry called
> light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can achieve submeter resolution.
> Due to expense, acquisition of LiDAR data is usually reserved for
> special projects of lim- ited extent, such as floodplain mapping,
> where high impact or economic value demands high resolution. Due to
> high sampling frequency of the reflected laser light, many nonterrain
> features are recorded that must be removed by postprocessing of the
> data. LiDAR elevation data are col- lected and processed as a regular
> array of elevations in raster format. Digital data describing terrain
> are available for the United States and much of the world from the
> Internet at 1-km or better resolution, and rounded to the nearest one
> meter in elevation. The USGS has produced these DEMs at 90-meter
> resolution for most areas in the United States,
>
> with 30-meter data commonly available and even 10-meter resolution in
> some U.S. locations (see Internet Resources at the end of this
> chapter). While generally available DEM data are useful for analysis
> of larger watersheds, they may be too coarse for small drainage areas,
> urbanized areas, or flat terrains that lack sufficient vertical
> resolution, i.e., elevation difference for reliable delineation.
>
> A raster DEM can be used to delineate efficiently watershed boundar-
> ies, stream networks, and hydrologic characteristics of a watershed.
> Many of the methods used for watershed delineation stem from Peuker
> and Doug- las (1975), O'Callaghan and Mark (1984), and Jenson and
> Domingue (1988). Many of the innovations since these pioneering
> methods deal with difficul- ties posed by pits, anomalies, and flat
> areas within the digital representation of terrain. While a raster DEM
> can produce accurate boundaries, additional processing is usually
> required to force the boundary to agree with accepted or known
> boundaries. Errors in automatically generated boundaries can stem from
> the precision of the elevation model among other factors (Fisher and
> Tate, 2006), which may not be sufficient to pick up boundaries in flat
> areas. Various methods have been developed for overcoming the
> difficulty with flat areas when delineating a watershed from digital
> terrain data that may contain pits or anomalies. Zhu et al. (2005)
> developed a hybrid method for depression filling and scanning
> neighboring cells for assigning flow direc- tion over flat areas. The
> relationship between the drainage network and hydrologic response is
> termed geomorphic. Moussa (2003) compared and classified the basin
> shape and delineated stream network in an effort to identify scale
> effects present in the relationship between morphometric properties
> and the basin hydrological response. Selecting a threshold that
> defines a stream channel will result in a more or less detailed stream
> channel network that should correspond to actual watershed geomorphic
> character- istics. Methods for automatic delineation of watershed
> boundaries from DEMs are discussed in Section 10.5.

> **Triangulated Irregular Network**

> The word *radar* is an acronym for radio detection and ranging. Radar

> detection of a variety of targets. Some of these targets are

> strength of the returned signal, i.e., reflectivity, depends on the
> cross section of the object and an electrical property called the
> dielectric constant. The returned signal strength is also termed
> reflectivity. The Doppler effect measures whether the object is moving

support are provided by the NEXRAD agencies, which are the NWS, the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Air Force. NEXRAD is
technically known as the WSR-88D (weather surveillance radar prototyped
in 1988; the D is for Doppler). WSR-88D is a Doppler radar with a 10-cm-
wavelength (S-band) transmitter/receiver that records reflectivity,
radial Doppler velocity, and the spectrum width of reflected signals. A
typical WSR-88D installation is shown in Figure 11--1. Located near
Norman, Okla- homa, the radar installation designated by the call sign
KTLX was the first operational WSR-88D radar installed in the United
States.

Approximately 160 WSR-88D radars have been installed in the conti-
nental United States (CONUS) and abroad at U.S. military installations.
Figure 11--2 shows the distribution of WSR-88D radars nationwide along
with 230-km range circles centered over each radar installation.
Coverage of the United States is generally good except in western areas,
where few radars exist or terrain causes blockage. Within the
continental United States, there is usually at least one WSR-88D radar
within 230-km range of a given location. From the strength of the
returned signal, and after adjusting for distance and other effects,
certain characteristics can be deduced about the target. Water in the
form of raindrops, hail, or snowflakes reflects energy transmitted by
the radar. In the case of raindrops, the strength of the returned signal
is related to the rainfall rate. The primary use of radar in hydrology
is the estimation of precipitation based on reflectivity.

> Atmospheric conditions between the radar and target affect the effi-

> **Radar Equation**
>
> Reflectivity values are obtained from radar measurements of the

> relation to the wavelength of the impinging radiation, the Rayleigh
> approximation is used. Under this assumption, Rayleigh backscattering
> of radiation of wavelength l from raindrops of diameter *D* is valid
> when *D* 6 l 16 . The WSR-88D radar operates at a frequency equivalent
> to a wavelength of 10 cm (also referred to as S-band). Raindrops
> rarely exceed 4 or 5 mm before they break up into smaller drops.
> Backscattered radiation by raindrops measured with a 10-cm-wavelength

> in the atmosphere larger than 4 or 5 mm differ in scattering proper-
> ties and would be described by the Mie rather than the Rayleigh
> backscat- tering property (AMS, 2000).
>
> In radar meteorology, the Probert--Jones equation is also known as the
> radar equation (Doviak and Zrnic, 1993). The Probert--Jones equation

> range to the target. Reflectivity, *Z*, is expressed in units of
> mm^6^/m^3^, or the sixth power of the diameter of rain- drops in mm

> Because the returned power decreases according to the square of the

> **Reflectivity--Rainfall Relationship**
>
> What is rain? While we all have ideas about rain from experience, to

> WSR-88D radar at Houston- Galveston (KHGX) underestimated the rainfall
> by as much as 50%. In a reanalysis of the radar reflectivity, Vieux
> and Bedient (1998) found that the tropical *Z-R Z* = 250*R*^1.2^
> relationship better characterized the October 1994 storm event than
> the *Z-R* relationship used by the NWS at the time of the event. Using
> the tropical *Z-R* to compute daily accumulations, the mean field bias
> for this event ranged from 6% underestimation on October 17 to 15%
> overestimation on October 18. From this study, the WSR-88D radar was
> found to be a viable source of rainfall information for flood warning
> and hydrologic prediction, provided that an appropriate *Z-R*

> radar-derived rainfall can be used for hydro- logic purposes.
>
> When gage-adjusted radar is used as rainfall input to lumped or dis-

> radar system characteristics and intended use, whether for severe
> storm and tornado detection or precipitation estimates. The following
> section describes the high-resolution precipita- tion products

>
> The WSR-88D radar is called a volume-scanning radar, because as the
> antenna rotates, it covers the surrounding atmosphere with successive
> tilts, beginning at 0.5-degree angles and incrementing approximately
> by 1 degree with each revolution. These measurements extend over the
> entire volume of the atmosphere, out to 460 km in range for
> reflectivity and 230 km for precipitation. Depending on the
> volume-scanning pattern (VCP), the rate at which each volume scan is
> completed varies from 5 or 6 minutes during precipitation to longer
> durations during *clear air* mode. Rates of data acquisition are 12,
> 10, and 6 volume scans per hour for VCP 11, VCP 21, and VCP 32,
> respectively. These variable rates have important conse- quences on
> the reflectivity and derived precipitation products. From a hydrologic
> viewpoint, the VCP determines the time resolution of rainfall
> intensities and depth estimates. During a storm event, a NEXRAD radar
> operator may switch from VCP 11 to VCP 21 and back several times,
> caus- ing variable time-step precipitation estimates or hyetographs.
> New volume scanning strategies have been put into practice by the NWS
> to measure quickly evolving severe storms more rapidly in less than
> 2--3 minutes. To use derived estimates of rainfall, interpolation to
> constant-time interval is often necessary for use with hydrologic

> of the WSR-88D radar are described next.

> The Level II base data generated by the NEXRAD system are composed of
> reflectivity, Doppler velocity, and spectrum width. Reflectivity is of
> interest to hydrologists because the reflectivity data, reported in
> decibels of reflec- tance, dBZ, may be transformed into rainfall
> rates. *Z-R* relationships, as dem- onstrated, depend on a number of
> factors, including the DSD, making it necessary to calibrate the

> remove spurious reflectivity caused by sidelobe contamination, ground
> clutter, and anomalous propagation of the beam; reflectivity is
> converted to rainfall rate using a *Z-R* relationship; and rain rates
> are accumulated over time and adjusted based on rain gage reports.
> Provisions have been made for calibrating to rain gages located under
> the radar umbrella, although this has not been fully realized
> operationally by the NWS. Processing rainfall infor- mation from Level

> "super resolution" Level II data is planned for the NEXRAD system,
> which will be at 0.25-km range resolution and one-half degree azimuth.

> Rainfall rates are estimated from radar using a selected *Z-R*

> appropriate *Z-R* relationship according to the season or type of
> event producing the precipitation. The standard *Z-R* relationship
> used with the initial installation of all WSR-88D radars in the United
> States was *Z* = 300*R*^1.4^. Since deployment, the NWS has adopted
> several *Z*-*R* relationships that are applicable to convective,
> tropical, winter- time stratiform storms, among others. The tropical
> *Z-R* relationship, *Z* = 250*R*^1.2^, is more representative of warm
> rain processes that occur in areas near the tropics, e.g., coastal
> areas of Texas to Florida. The tropical *Z-R* is more appropriate for
> tropical storms or for storms from clouds that have temperatures 732°F
> producing rain from coalescence of droplets (AMS, 2000). Precipitation
> products currently generated by the NEXRAD radar product generator and
> single radar images obtained from the NWS via the web may not be gage
> adjusted.

> **GAGE ADJUSTMENT OF RADAR**
>
> With adequate maintenance, calibration, and data archiving, rain gage
> net- works provide important point measurements of rainfall, which are
> useful for rainfall estimation. Any measurement is subject to
> measurement errors. Rain gage measurement accuracy and precision
> depend on the type of gage, periodic maintenance, rain shadowing by
> adjacent obstructions, clog- ging, malfunctioning telemetry, and wind-
> and evaporation-induced losses. After rain gage data have been checked
> for missing data and systematic and random errors, they are used in
> conjunction with radar to estimate rainfall.
>
> The process for combining radar and gage estimates relies on comput-
> ing a systematic error, or bias correction factor, and applying the
> correction to the unadjusted radar rainfall accumulations. Computing a
> single bias cor- rection factor that is spatially constant is called a
> mean field bias correction. Allowing the correction factor to vary in
> space is termed a local bias correc- tion. Seo et al. (1999) and Seo
> and Breidenbach (2002) describe the mean field and local bias approach
> to gage correction of radar. After bias correc- tion, random errors
> related to scale differences between gage orifice and radar sample
> volume and updraft/downdraft effects will remain. After adjusting for
> systematic error, the radar estimate is consistent, though not
> necessarily in precise agreement with rainfall measured at a point
> location represented by the gage.
>
> **Mean Field Bias**
>
> Wilson and Brandes (1979) described removal of systematic errors in
> radar estimates using rain gage accumulations. Bias in radar terms
> means that the radar is overestimating or underestimating, compared
> with gage accumula- tions. At any one gage, the radar may be
> overestimating or underestimating. However, the mean over many gages
> provides a statistical basis for removing systematic bias. Pairs
> composed of gage (*G~i~*) and radar (*R~i~*) rainfall accumu- lations
> may be compared on an hourly, daily, or storm-total basis. Two meth-
> ods are commonly used for correcting radar estimates: (1) ratio of the
> means (RM) of the gage--radar pairs and (2) mean of the ratios.
> Correction of the radar bias is accomplished by applying the
> multiplicative factor *F~RM~*, which removes the mean field bias

> The physics-based distributed hydrologic model, V*flo*™, employs a
> finite-ele- ment solution of the kinematic wave equations for runoff

> for runoff generation. Physically realistic model parameters are
> derived from geospatial data repre- sentative of the terrain, soils,
> and land use/cover and input as gridded files from the GIS. Vieux
> (2004) describes the model background, governing equations,
> parameterization using geospatial data, distributed model calibration,
> and sample model applications. Application of the model to predict
> reservoir inflow and its sensitivity to rainfall input and soil
> moisture is presented by Vieux et al. (2009). Vieux and Moreda (2003)
> describe the ordered physics-based param- eter adjustment (OPPA)
> approach used to calibrate a distributed model. The identification of

> The model is designed to use distributed rainfall rates derived from

> The model is appli- cable both in rural watersheds that range in scale
> from headwaters to rivers and in urban settings by explicit
> representation of hydraulic characteristics and watershed conditions.
> The model setup and data required are as follows.

1.  **Geospatial data.** Geospatial data are used to set up V*flo*™
    > starting with a digital elevation model (DEM) for the derivation
    > of slope and flow direction; remotely sensed land use/cover for
    > overland hydrau- lic roughness; impervious area and soil
    > characteristics for the deriva- tion of Green and Ampt
    > infiltration parameters and soil depth; channel geometry and
    > hydraulic characteristics.

2.  **Precipitation inputs.** Rainfall and snowmelt may be input on a
    > grid- ded basis as maps, or input as uniformly distributed
    > rainfall rates/ accumulations. Distributed precipitation formats
    > supported include radar formats, e.g., NEXRAD Level II
    > reflectivity, and ESRI ASCII grids. Automated filtering of the
    > radar grid into the model grid is

> available when geographic projection information is provided. Point
> hyetographs may be input for subareas such as basins or uniformly over
> the entire domain with user-defined or SCS-type hyetographs. Snowmelt
> is modeled on a distributed basis using the temperature index method.
> Synthetic dynamic (moving) design storms are simu- lated for defined
> hyetographs, movement, and direction.

3.  **Runoff routing.** The kinematic wave equations are solved on a
    > grid- cell basis within a drainage network composed of finite
    > elements. The formulas are adapted to represent overland and
    > channel hydrau- lics. Floodplain storage effects can be simulated
    > using the Modified Puls method to account for attenuation due to
    > temporary storage. Complex channel hydraulics can be represented
    > by (1) rating curves for stage area/discharge, (2) surveyed
    > channel cross sections with slope and Manning's roughness, or (3)
    > trapezoidal cross sections with slope and Manning's roughness.

4.  **Soil moisture and infiltration.** The infiltration module is the
    > Green and Ampt equation, which relies on the soil properties to
    > model runoff. Infiltration rate excess runoff is computed in each
    > grid cell as a func- tion of soil properties and antecedent
    > conditions. Once the soil storage capacity is filled, saturation
    > excess runoff is then computed. When the soil moisture is modeled
    > over time, the infiltration rate is adjusted to account for a
    > range of soil moisture. The rate of soil moisture deple- tion is
    > limited by the climatologic evapotranspiration (ET) rate and
    > available soil moisture. Impervious area and initial abstraction
    > may be set to account for urbanization effects or ponding on the
    > land surface.

5.  **Distributed output.** A feature unique to distributed models is
    > the capability to output distributed runoff and other hydrologic
    > quanti- ties at any location. This capability supports generation
    > of hydro- graphs at locations selected in the drainage network
    > regardless of current watershed delineations. Distributed runoff
    > can be used for water quality modeling and transport such as
    > debris flow forecasting where heavy rainfall, soil conditions, and
    > slope play a role in the initiation of landslides and subsequent
    > transport of mud and debris. Because the model outputs stage at
    > distributed locations along the channel, inundation mapping can be
    > accomplished that is more detailed than routing in channel
    > reaches.

> The V*flo*™ model is designed for ingest of radar or gridded
> precipita- tion on an event scale, or over a longer-term continuous
> basis. In the latter case, a series of distributed rainfall grids are
> provided and used along with potential evapotranspiration to model
> runoff. Cumulative runoff volume, infiltration volume, and discharge
> are tabulated during the continuous sim- ulation period. Thus, with

> **Hydrologic Model Summary**
>
> **HEC-HMS.** Two options exist for importing WSR-88D data into HEC-
> HMS. One method is to take the average rainfall from the radar grid
> cells within a basin or subbasin and create a pseudo-precipitation
> gage. The time step can vary from about 5 minutes up to a user-defined
> increment. HEC-HMS is then run with radar rainfall as input, and
> output hydrographs are compared to observed stream gage informa- tion.
> The number of subbasins in the HEC-HMS model affects the resulting
> hydrograph accuracy, because averaging high- and low-inten- sity
> rainfall over larger areas can cause discrepancies in the modeled
> watershed response. Another option in HEC-HMS is to use gridded data
> in the Modified Clark (or ModClark) unit hydrograph method. In either
> case, it is important to use the radar data that have been adjusted to
> gage accumulations, or at least compared for consistency. Import
> options exist for bringing both of these data types into the HEC-HMS
> model. Basin hyetographs derived from radar can be input in a manner
> similar to a rain gage hyetograph.
>
> **Flood warning systems.** Radar rainfall can provide timely
> information for estimating river or stream levels related to flooding.
> The advantage of radar is that rainfall can be extracted directly over
> basins of interest in near real time. Based on a selected threshold
> base of rainfall accu- mulations, a flood threat can be recognized and
> actions taken to miti- gate impacts or reduce public exposure to
> flooded conditions. Besides computing thresholds, running a hydrologic
> model in real time using the radar rainfall as input can provide
> additional flood threat informa- tion (Bedient et al., 2003; Vieux and
> Bedient, 2004; Janek et al., 2006). Lead time and the hydrologic
> response time of a basin can limit the area that can be feasibly
> forecast. Soil moisture tracking by the hydro- logic model run in real
> time is an important consideration in most watersheds, such that the
> model will be properly initialized by anteced- ent soil moisture
> conditions. Chapter 12 presents more details on flood alert systems.
>
> **Distributed hydrologic models.** Distributed models preserve the
> spatial variation of slope, hydraulic roughness, infiltration, and
> rainfall input without lumping to the watershed-level of aggregation.
> Such models use physics-based conservation equations to represent
> overland and channel flow. Full dynamic, kinematic, and diffusive wave
> analogies are used to derive systems of equations that are then solved
> by finite- difference or finite-element methods. V*flo*™ is a
> distributed model that runs as a real-time operational application or
> as a desktop model (Vieux et al., 2003; Vieux and Vieux, 2002; Vieux,
> 2004). Parameters are derived from geospatial data and published
> physical characteristics according to the method described in Vieux
> (2004) and Vieux and Moreda (2003).
>
> **Additional Resources**
>
> Understanding the usage and variability of precipitation can be
> investigated using the tutorials provided online for V*flo*™. See the
> website for supplemental resources that include access to model
> software, tutorials, and required data.
>
> **EXAMPLE 11--4**
>
> **V*flo*™ MODEL EXAMPLE**
>
> As this example demonstrates, the physics-based distributed approach
> produces hydrograph response that matches observed flow without model
> parameter calibration. The V*flo*™ model uses the conservation of mass
> and momentum equations to route rainfall excess through a network com-
> posed of overland and channel cells. Runoff from both infiltration
> rate excess (i.e., when rainfall rate exceeds infiltration rate) and
> saturation ex- cess (when the fillable porosity within the soil
> profile becomes saturated) is modeled simultaneously in the watershed.
>
> The hydrograph response to rainfall input is determined from the
> hydraulic characteristics of the drainage network. The rainfall rates
> in each grid cell determine how much runs off, while the slope and
> hydrau- lic roughness determine the flow depth and velocity of flow in
> overland and channel cells. The configuration of the drainage network
> that defines the watershed shape and the diversity of hydraulic travel
> time also deter- mine the hydrograph shape as expected from discussion
> in previous chap- ters on watershed response. The distribution in time
> and space of rainfall intensity coupled with terrain characteristics
> become an important deter- minant of the response in terms of runoff
> volume, peak discharge, timing of the peak, and the entire hydrograph
> shape.
>
> Accurate portrayal of the distributed drainage network, vegetative
> cover, and soil characteristics can result in hydrograph predictions
> that agree well with observed streamflow without model parameter
> calibration. An example of this agreement is offered for the 9.58
> mi^2^ Fishpot Creek located in eastern Missouri for three events, two
> in May and July of 2008, and one in February of 2009. The model
> parameters and radar rainfall used in this case study are presented
> below and are made available via the website that contains detailed
> datasets for V*flo*™ and radar rainfall.
>
> **Watershed Description**
>
> To begin the watershed analysis, digital terrain is obtained from
> LiDAR presented in Figure E11--4--1, and is used to extract the
> drainage network and slope. Channels are delineated for 10% of the
> area. The drainage network extracted by the V*flo*™ module called
> AutoBop is seen in Fig- ure E11--4--2. The cells are assigned as
> channels such that channel cells comprise 10% of the watershed. See
> Chapter 10 for a description of GIS watershed delineation. The
> watershed is long and narrow implying that runoff from the upper part
> of the watershed will take longer to arrive at the outlet than runoff
> following flow paths nearer to the outlet.

> **Parameters**
>
> Once the network has been extracted, parameters are assigned to
> overland and channels based on land use/cover, or more specific
> information known for the watershed (see Chapter 10). Maps of
> hydraulic roughness are derived from standard lookup tables of land
> use/cover (see for example, Vieux, 2004,
>
> p\. 124) and used to populate the model grid. Table E11--4--1 presents
> the range of distributed parameters used to obtain the three event
> hydrographs. The soils in the Fishpot Creek are classified as a silt
> loam in the top layer, 0−7 inches, (A-horizon) with urban built-up
> areas for over 60% of the soils in the watershed. The clay
> accumulation in the B-horizon of the soil transi- tions to silty clay
> loam at deeper depths. From sand, silt, clay, and gravel fractions,
> the Green and Ampt parameters of hydraulic conductivity, wet- ting
> front suction, and porosity are estimated for the A-horizon of the
> soil profile. Urban development is evident from the patterns observed
> in the impervious map seen in Chapter 10, Figure 10--5(a). For this
> watershed, imperviousness is estimated from the NLCD land use/cover
> and averages

0.31 (31%). Converted the NLCD to roughness, the watershed ranges from

> 0.024 to 0.2, with an average of n=0.040 in the watershed. Both the
> Green-- Ampt and hydraulic roughness parameters in Table E11--4--1 are
> sampled from the original maps into the 75-m model grid for the basin.
>
> **Radar Rainfall Input**
>
> Inputs to the model consist of gauge-adjusted radar rainfall (GARR);
> that is, rain rates have been adjusted by the local bias correction
> described herein Chapter 11. Three events are tested using GARR and
> the output simulated at the USGS 07019120 stream gauge and compared to
> observed flow during this events. In Figure E11--4--3, the rainfall
> total (upper image) and the basin- averaged hyetograph (lower) are
> shown for the July 28, 2008, event. The total rainfall for this event
> averages 1.37 in. with the main runoff producing rain rate over 1.5
> in./hr falling between 3:30 and 4:30 across the basin.

>
> Severe storms and the resulting major floods have taken their toll in
> the United States, especially over the last 25 years. Figure 12--1,
> created by the National Climatic Data Center, shows the distribution
> of 67 various types of natural disasters with damages in excess of 1
> billion dollars that occurred between 1980 and 2005. The image is
> dominated by hurricane- and flood- related occurrences, particularly
> in the southeastern and south central regions of the country. The vast
> majority of these disasters occur in or near highly urbanized cities
> and coastal areas. Notable among them are Hurri- canes Katrina (2005),
> Ike (2008), Andrew (1992), the midwest floods along the Mississippi
> (1993), Hurricanes Rita (2005), Charley (2004), and Ivan (2004). The
> damages for these events alone totaled over \$350 billion. Other, less
> costly, but still significant flood-related damages can be seen in
> other portions of the United States. The figure clearly demonstrates
> the severity of the flood problem at the national level, even after
> years of investment in "flood control" and the improvement of severe
> weather forecasts.

**12.2**

> **FLOOD MANAGEMENT**
>
> **ISSUES AND BASIC TERMINOLOGY**
>
> Flooding and its associated damages have been with us throughout
> history. While there are innumerable definitions for the words *flood*
> or *flooding,* after the major midwest flood of 1993 a fairly complete
> definition was pro- vided by the U.S. Executive Office of the
> President (USEOP). The USEOP defined a flood as "a general and
> temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry
> land areas from the overflow of river and/or tidal waters and/or the
> unusual accumulation of waters from any source that may be associated
> with undesirable effects to life and property" (USEOP, 1994). The
> definition emphasizes certain critical aspects of flooding such as
> inunda- tion and damage, aspects which will be defined and highlighted
> throughout this chapter.
>
> A **floodplain** can be defined as low lands adjoining a channel or a
> river, stream, watercourse, or lake that have been or may be inundated
> by flood- water. Figure 12--2 shows a typical floodplain as the area
> of inundation to be expected, on average, once every 100 years. Most
> major channel and river systems have floodplains defined by the
> Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through the National Flood
> Insurance Program (NFIP), as well as by the U.S. Army Corps of
> Engineers (COE). The **floodway** is an area within the floodplain
> that contains the fastest-moving water. It is com- puted by modeling
> encroachment on either side of the channel such that the floodplain
> elevation increases by one foot. This is normally computed with a
> model such as HEC-2 or HEC-RAS (see Chapter 7). The area between the
> floodplain and the floodway is called the flood fringe.

> A schematic of a 100-year floodplain and its associated floodway is
> pre- sented in Figure 12--2. Significant development within a
> floodplain results in significant losses in water resources,
> ecological resources, and human resources that may easily outweigh the
> property value of the floodplain. The floodplain includes a natural
> means of flood and erosion control that reduces sedimenta- tion,
> provides large amounts of storage, and naturally reduces flood peaks
> and valleys. With respect to water quality, the floodplain can filter
> nutrients and impurities from runoff prior to deposition in the river
> and serves as a natural temperature and organic waste moderator. From
> the ecological perspective, floodplains increase biological
> productivity and provide important fish and wildlife habitats. The
> integrity of the existing ecosystem is maintained by a sustained
> biodiversity and an atmosphere conducive to plant and animal growth.
> Often, these areas serve as natural habitats or wildlife corridors for
> endangered species. Floodplains represent a wealth of human resources
> by providing prime locations for aquaculture, enhanced agricultural
> lands, and open space that can be used for public recreation or nature
> appreciation.
>
> **Floodplain management**, a term often incorrectly used
> interchangeably with *flood control,* is an overall decision-making
> process whose goal is to achieve the appropriate use of the
> floodplain. *Appropriate use* is any activity compatible with the risk
> to natural and human resources located in the floodplain. It is the
> operation of an overall program of corrective and pre- ventive
> measures for reducing flood damage, including watershed manage- ment
> practices, emergency preparedness plans, floodplain management
> regulations, and flood control works. Floodplain management
> incorporates many of the political, social, and economic factors that
> directly affect the severity of floods with respect to the damage and
> choices involving what methods to employ in limiting this damage
> (USEOP, 1994).
>
> Deciding which flood control alternative to use in any specific water-
> shed is a very important decision within the larger framework of
> floodplain management. Any general flood control approach might
> include structural methods, nonstructural methods, or a combination of
> both. Examples of structural methods include channel modifications
> (channelization), reser- voirs, diversions, and levees or dikes. Those
> methods that seek to modify the damage susceptibility of developed
> regions within a floodplain are classified as nonstructural.
> Nonstructural measures include floodplain land acquisition (also
> commonly referred to as voluntary relocation or property buyouts),
> land use restrictions (zoning), flood proofing, flood warning systems,
> drain- age maintenance programs, and public awareness or information
> programs. One of the most beneficial aspects of a nonstructural
> approach to flood control is its greater utilization of the benefits
> provided by the natural flood- plain discussed earlier in this
> section. However, economically quantifying the total value of these
> benefits has proven to be a very difficult task. Accu- rately valuing
> environmental amenities continues to be the subject of much debate
> (NRC, 1999a). It is generally agreed that an established standard for
> assigning a dollar cost to specific amenities, such as wetlands,
> bottomland hardwoods, riparian forest, and green space, would provide
> a much-needed quantification of the indirect benefits provided by
> nonstructural measures. However, there are often too many widely
> differing variables from location to location to make the
> establishment of a general, and thus easily imple- mented, standard
> (or metric) very likely. Nevertheless, a variety of methods to measure
> environmental costs and benefits have been established, such as
> contingent valuation, the benefit-transfer method, and hedonic pricing
>
> (NRC, 1999b).
>
> Nonstructural approaches are not new, and there are several outstand-
> ing success stories where flooding has been controlled without major
> chan- nelization or other major structural controls. The Woodlands
> near Houston (Bedient et al., 1985) and Indian Bend Wash in Scottsdale
> (City of Scotts- dale, 1985) are two excellent examples where
> recreational areas and deten- tion ponds were used to better manage
> the floodplain, as urban development continued. However, some of the
> difficulties previously mentioned have lim- ited the widespread
> implementation of these methods.
>
> **Structural Methods for Flood Damage Reduction**
>
> The United States has pursued, throughout much of its history, the
> mostly singular course of attempting to control floods through the use
> of structures (Reisner, 1993; Smith and Ward, 1998). The structural
> approach's rise to dominance began in the 1930s with the passage of
> the 1936 Flood Control Act and the creation of the Federal Crop
> Insurance Corporation. This action placed the federal government in
> the lead with respect to the nation's efforts to control flooding as
> well as the compensation of its victims. By 1940, the
>
> **12.3**

> **STRUCTURAL AND NONSTRUCTURAL METHODS OF FLOOD CONTROL**
>
> government had assumed the full cost of building and maintaining dams,
> channel modifications, and rectification projects for all navigable
> waters of the United States (USEOP, 1994). Advances in the fields of
> fluid mechanics, hydrologic systems, statistical hydrology,
> infiltration, evaporation analysis, and flood routing throughout the
> 1940s made the goal of designing and con- structing large-scale
> control structures well within the reach and extremely effective
> (Chapter 1).
>
> Structural alternatives include channel modifications in a variety of
> forms: the use of reservoirs or detention/retention ponds to retard or
> contain flood flows; the construction of levees or floodwalls to
> contain flows within a designated floodway; and diversions to redirect
> flood flows to an alternate, off-channel floodway or detention pond.
> Each of these methods is viable under certain conditions and has
> associated advantages and disadvantages (Mays, 2001). The failure of
> levees in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina exemplifies the
> importance of choosing appropriate structural methods to protect from
> all reasonable conditions. A brief description of these types of
> structural alternatives follows.
>
> **Flood Control Reservoirs**
>
> Flood control reservoirs provide an effective means of managing and
> con- trolling flood flows. These basins can range from as simple a
> structure as a small pond planned alongside a highway or road culvert
> to a large reservoir with control structures designed to hold extreme
> volumes of water. Regard- less of their size, all reservoirs serve the
> same function of providing addi- tional storage to attenuate the peak
> flow experienced during a storm event (Chapter 9).
>
> Flood control reservoirs can be divided into two basic types,
> detention and retention. Detention reservoirs or ponds are designed to
> hold runoff for a short period before releasing it to the natural
> watercourse. Retention ponds are designed to hold runoff for extended
> periods, usually for aesthetic, agricultural, consumptive, or other
> uses (Chow et al., 1988). Chapter 9 includes an example of a standard
> detention pond design used in small urban watersheds. Extremely large
> retention structures are also referred to as stor- age reservoirs.
> These storage facilities are associated with large dams and are often
> not created solely for flood protection but also for water supply.
>
> The beneficial reduction of peak runoffs and resulting flood
> protection afforded at a particular point on a stream by a reservoir
> depends primarily on the fraction of the watershed area above the
> protected point, which is governed by the location of the reservoir
> structure. This reduction is progres- sively reduced as runoff from
> the watershed area below the reservoir becomes appreciable and the
> distance downstream of the reservoir increases. This distance varies
> and is dependent upon watershed characteristics such as the number and
> size of tributaries and the shape of the watershed. To be effective, a
> reservoir site must be available not too far upstream. This may
>
> serve as a significant advantage over other types of flood control,
> since a smaller reservoir may be constructed just upstream of a
> flood-prone loca- tion, providing adequate flood protection while
> limiting excavation costs and environmental impact.
>
> However, reservoir location may serve as a disadvantage when large-
> scale protection is desired and location sites are limited, since
> extremely large reservoirs are required to provide significant
> downstream protection. The reservoir option provides particularly
> limited protection against large storm events in areas where both the
> overland slope and natural channel are small (USACE, 1996). Other
> significant drawbacks include finding locations to dispose of
> excavated material and aesthetic concerns when the con- structed pond
> is not being used for flood control (see also Chapter 9).
>
> **Channel Modifications and Environmental Impacts**
>
> Channel modifications are performed to improve the conveyance
> character- istics and carrying capacity of a natural stream. A natural
> channel's convey- ance and capacity can be improved by altering one or
> more of the dependent hydraulic variables of channel slope, depth,
> width, and roughness (Brookes, 1989). The resulting increased
> hydraulic efficiency of the "improved" chan- nel results in increased
> flow velocities, which in turn result in reduced flood stages or water
> surface elevations for a given storm event.
>
> These modifications, often referred to as "channelization," have been
> extensively used throughout the United States for decades with
> effective results (Smith and Ward, 1998). This technique is especially
> common as a flood control measure for meandering streams of the south
> and southeastern coastal plains (Brookes, 1988). However, the
> channelization approach has always been clouded in controversy, since
> in certain cases the associated harmful effects on the environment may
> exceed benefits. Channelization permits the control of flooding in
> natural, existing waterways to protect already established urban,
> agricultural, and industrial developments. In addition, channel
> projects allow and often promote economic development within the
> floodplain. Specific channelization projects may be undertaken for one
> or more reasons: for flood control, to drain wetlands, to improve
> navigation, and to prevent bank erosion and channel migration, thereby
> protecting neighboring property (USACE, 1996).
>
> Channelization has brought major benefits, both direct and indirect,
> to urban, agriculture, transportation, and other sectors of the
> economy by providing effective flood control throughout the stretches
> of river reach where it has been applied. Its effectiveness is
> highlighted by the fact that from 1820 to 1970, more than 200,000
> miles of the nation's waterways was modified (Schoof, 1980).
>
> A history of proven results seemed to make channelization the alterna-
> tive of choice for many flood control agencies until the mid-1970s.
> However, growing concerns over the long-term effectiveness of
> channelization and the
>
> environmental impacts generated by this approach brought the
> widespread construction of these types of projects to a near
> standstill. The channeliza- tion work of the Soil Conservation Service
> (SCS) and the COE became so controversial during the late 1960s that
> the U.S. Congress commissioned Arthur D. Little, Inc., to make a
> comprehensive nationwide survey of the environmental effects of these
> projects and report their findings to the Coun- cil on Environmental
> Quality. This landmark report would serve as the basis for extensive
> debate over the best course of action for flood control through- out
> the next few decades; however, there can be no denying the near-imme-
> diate and broad-reaching impact this report would have on
> channelization projects (A. D. Little, 1973).
>
> The Little report in 1973 stated that the direct benefits of the chan-
> nelization projects it studied were, in fact, conservatively
> estimated. It con- cluded that the vast majority of flood channel
> modifications were performing as designed and that the approximate

> The Little report indicated that many environmental effects of channel

> channelization scheme. These include:

-   Drainage of neighboring wetlands;

-   Cutting off of oxbows and stream meanders;

-   Lowering of ground water levels, resulting in reduced stream
    > recharge;

-   Clearing of floodplain bottom-land hardwoods and destruction of
    > wildlife habitat;

-   Increased erosion of stream banks, leading to stability problems;

-   Increased downstream deposition of silt and sedimentation;

-   Increased downstream flooding as a result of increased upstream
    > velocities;

-   Impacts on the stream's and receiving body's aquatic life;

-   Reduced aesthetics and loss of visual amenity.

> **Diversion Channels, Levees, and By-Pass Channels**
>
> Diversions are used to reroute or bypass a portion of the flood flow
> away from a flood-prone area. This results in reduced peak flows at
> the area of interest. The method only provides downstream protection,
> and the amount of protection diminishes downstream in a similar
> fashion to reservoirs. Diversions are often used in conjunction with
> off-line (away from the main channel) reservoirs, as the diverted
> flows must still be contained and/or passed around the area of
> concern. Their significant drawback is that suffi- cient right-of-way
> must be available to contain or direct the diverted flows into
> neighboring basins.
>
> Levees are linear structures, often consisting of earthen embankments
> or reinforced concrete walls, built parallel to the main stream with
> the pur- pose of containing a specified design overbank flow. These
> structures are often located very near the natural floodway and on
> both sides of the river, providing protection to the entire natural
> floodplain. This alternative is con- sidered the oldest and most
> widespread type of localized flood defense worldwide, including the
> United States, and plays a fundamental role in flood control. Levees
> increase the local carrying capacity of the channel and are intended
> to prevent all flood damage to the adjacent river corridor until the
> water level exceeds the top of the structure. Their most significant
> draw- back is that if overtopped, flood damage is incurred as if the
> structure did not exist. Given the historical trend of development
> within the floodplain (especially with the additional sense of
> security provided by the floodwalls), damages often exceed what would
> have occurred without the levee. Addi- tional drawbacks include
> increased downstream flow rates and resulting increased downstream
> flood damages, significant right-of-way requirements, notable
> environmental impacts similar to channelization, and others (NWF,
> 1998). A rare combination of weather events led to the midwestern
> flood of 1993 that breached many levees along the Mississippi River.
>
> The floods of 2011 were the newest in the series of floods that has
> caused to the Mississippi basins. Early estimates were that damage
> costs could reach around \$4 billion dollars. Much of the damages were
> caused to crop lands that were inundated from the opening of spillways
> in order to save cities such as Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans,
> Louisiana. In contrast to the 1993 floods, the 2011 event had the
> added component of the melting of heavy winter snows in addition to
> the excessive rainfall (Drye, 2011). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
> decided to open the three post
>
> 1927 flood spillways: the Morganza Spillway located 186 miles upriver
> from New Orleans, the Bonnet Carre Spillway located about 33 miles
> above New Orleans, and the Bird Point Spillway located in Missouri.
> This is the first time in history that all three of these spillways
> have been open at the same time and was done in order to save New
> Orleans from possible floods that could have been worse than those
> caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Rioux, 2011).
>
> More recently, the discussion of levees returned to the forefront of
> public discussion after Hurricane Katrina impacted the coastal city of
> New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005. The unprecedented damage, in both
> lives and dollars, experienced during this natural disaster was partly
> due to the failure of the levee system designed to protect large
> portions of the city. As a result, questions as to the methodology,
> implementation, and adequacy of this flood damage reduction
> alternative quickly arose. More information about Hur- ricane Katrina
> and its impact on New Orleans is provided in Section 12.5.

> **Nonstructural Methods for Flood Damage Reduction**
>
> Nonstructural measures are used to reduce the damage potential of a
> struc- ture or facility within the floodplain by adjusting the use of
> flood-prone lands to the flood hazard. This approach contrasts starkly
> with its structural coun- terpart, which instead attempts to minimize
> the flood hazard by actually altering flood flows (Mays, 2001). The
> amounts of reduction in damage potential achieved by nonstructural
> measures vary significantly, depending on the mechanism implemented.
>
> There exist a wide variety of nonstructural flood controls, including
> (USEOP, 1994):

-   Flood proofing;

-   Flood warning mechanisms;

-   Land-use controls such as zoning and development ordinances;

-   Flood insurance programs;

-   Flood preparedness activities;

-   Public awareness and education programs;

-   Existing primary and secondary drainage system maintenance;

-   Acquisition of floodplain land or voluntary flood-prone property
    > buyouts.

> Nonstructural methods have only recently been given serious
> consideration as a primary means of reducing flood damages, although
> their potential usefulness has been researched for over 50 years.
> Alternative options to structural methods were perhaps first
> articulated by White in 1945. In the 1950s, the Tennessee Valley
> Authority, with its broad mandate for water- management
> experimentation, proved an effective pilot program for many
> nonstructural measures with promising results. Additionally, the
> nonstruc- tural movement was somewhat popularized by Leopold and
> Maddock in 1954 as well as by Hoyt and Langbein in 1955, resulting in
> professional inter- est and the involvement of the American Society of
> Civil Engineers in the development of a Guide for the Development of
> Flood Plain Regulations. However, it was in 1966 that a concerted
> effort to integrate nonstructural measures into federal flood control
> policy would take place.
>
> A 1966 Presidential Task Force on Floodplain Regulations, charged with
> making recommendations for improving the existing federal flood con-
> trol policy, highlighted five basic objectives for developing a
> unified national program for managing flood losses. These were:

-   Improve the basic knowledge about flood hazards at both the local
    > and regional level;

-   Improve planning and coordinating of all new developments in the
    > floodplain;

-   Improve technical services available to floodplain managers;

-   Create a national program for flood insurance;

-   Allow for the future adjustment of federal flood control policy to
    > changing needs.

> The Task Force report spurred action to develop uniformity in
> floodplain management strategies across a myriad of federal agencies,
> including the Soil Conservation Service and the COE. Additionally, an
> important result of the report was the creation of the NFIP through
> the Flood Control Act of 1968.
>
> In 1998, the NWF completed a report, *Higher Ground,* which addressed
> two of the most important nonstructural issues affecting
> floodplains---repetitive flood losses under the NFIP and voluntary
> property buyouts. These issues are addressed in the next two sections.
>
> **The National Flood Insurance Program**
>
> In response to the failure of the private sector to provide
> reasonable, cost- effective flood insurance to the average buyer, the
> NFIP was created by the Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NWF, 1998). This
> program was designed to provide cost-effective insurance to property
> owners who live within the 100- year floodplain in communities that
> have established a minimum standard of hazard mitigation provisions.
> The goal, in principle, was simple: Allow the insurance premiums and
> not the general taxpayer to cover the cost of flood
>
> damages. The required mitigation provisions would enforce floodplain
> development regulations, guidelines, and limitations. The NFIP was
> placed under the cognizance of the newly formed FEMA in 1979.
>
> The program has enjoyed some success. Flood insurance premiums covered
> \$10.4 billion in losses and program expenses between the years 1977
> and 1997 (NWF, 1998). As an additional benefit, the program has
> stimulated additional floodplain management concepts and programs
> throughout the country.
>
> However, the program has experienced major shortcomings in the form of
> policy and financial distortions, repetitive loss properties, poor
> enforcement of regulations pivotal to the success of the program, and
> sig- nificant inaccuracies in floodplain delineations (NWF, 1998).
> Many oppo- nents of the plan argue that it has actually encouraged
> development and rebuilding in high-risk areas with the promise of a
> "limitless guarantee" of governmentally sponsored bailouts.
>
> The existence of repetitive loss properties (RLPs) is a drain upon the
> efficiency and effectiveness of the program (NWF, 1998). Although com-
> prising only 2% of the properties insured, these properties are
> responsible for nearly 40% of the program's payments. The City of
> Houston is ranked number three on the Top 200 Repetitive Loss
> Communities Rankings by payments. The city has an estimated 2030 RLPs
> with total payments in excess of \$114 million (NWF, 1998). The shear
> enormity of flood damages in 2004 and 2005 strained the NFIP to an
> unprecedented level, causing multiple insurance companies to declare
> bankruptcy and general insurance costs to increase.
>
> Despite this evidence that the NFIP is not the singular flood control
> answer, its advantages and effectiveness are far reaching. The program
> has spurred an ever-increasing awareness of the benefits of a sound
> flood mitiga- tion strategy and even highlighted the environmental
> benefits of the flood- plain when put to its natural use.
>
> **Voluntary Buyouts of Flood-Prone Property**
>
> The buyout of high-risk floodplain properties from willing sellers and
> the relocation of at-risk buildings and structures out of the
> floodplain are non- structural alternatives that have received
> increased attention in recent years (NWF, 1998). The catastrophic
> midwest flood of 1993 along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, as
> well as several resulting postflood studies and recom- mendations,
> spurred national interest in this particular alternative. The
> essentials of the voluntary buyout program are clearly stated in
> *Higher Ground* (NWF, 1998).
>
> The overall goal of this alternative is simple to achieve in theory
> but very difficult to achieve in practice. Theoretically, a one-time
> expenditure of public funds would result in the evacuation of a
> specified floodplain area. This cost, although significant, would
> result in the complete elimination of
>
> flood risk for those areas. Ideally, the long-term financial benefits
> (in the form of reduced flood losses and an increase in environmental
> benefits) would more than compensate for the initial cost.
>
> *Higher Ground* lists the ideal goals of a well-planned voluntary
> buyout program. These include:

-   Seek and secure a combination of federal, state, and local funds for
    > one-time buyouts of high-risk properties from willing sellers;

-   Ensure the return of the purchased property to its natural
    > floodplain state;

-   Pass legislation that would prohibit the expenditure of any future
    > disaster assistance to that location;

-   Provide assistance to former property owners and tenants to move to
    > higher ground and out of harm's way, and, as appropriate, relocate
    > homes and businesses outside the floodplain.

> This type of program has specific advantages over structural flood
> con- trol options as well as many other nonstructural methods. Perhaps
> its great- est benefit is that it provides permanent disaster relief
> and help to at-risk people and property. Other strong points include
> the fact that proper imple- mentation of this plan would end an
> unlimited disaster relief obligation on public funds by putting tax
> dollars to the most cost-effective use possible. Lastly, the program
> would truly realize the environmental benefits of the floodplains by
> restoring them to their natural ecological functions and thereby
> provide many of the benefits listed earlier.
>
> Buyouts are not without limitations and drawbacks. Buyout programs can
> reduce the local tax base by forcing businesses and significant
> investors to "look elsewhere"---namely, to other communities. Improper
> regulatory enforcement or the lack of a sound land management plan
> after the buyouts may result in renewed development pressure, forcing
> a change in local regu- latory laws that would once again allow
> floodplain development. Many buy- out plans have been criticized as a
> method of driving low-income residents out of a central, often
> desirable, part of a community, paving the way for future upscale
> developments. Lastly, significant costs, time, and careful plan- ning
> are required to successfully implement a buyout plan, regardless of
> its scope. The fact that buyouts involve significant changes in
> land-use patterns, often within well-established areas of a community,
> may present insur- mountable legal, social, and economic difficulties
> that force the decision- making process toward a more conventional
> structural method (NWF, 1998).

> In designing protective works, there are several names for the

> and the "maximum prob- able flood." It must be emphasized that one of
> the most undesirable aspects of structural devices is that they are
> expected to fail, if an occurrence exceeds their design

> given rise to an astonishing paradox of increasing flood damages
> despite the enormous expenditures to reduce them. John Wilkinson, in a
> report written to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1967,
> attempted to sum- marize factors creating this circumstance.

> Memories are short; upstream detention storage and flood walls foster
> a false sense of security; flood-prone urban land has high locational
> value; development near the river channel constricts
>
> flood passage, creating backwater over a flood plain on which
> development also encroaches; developers don't pay for flood relief,
> rehabilitation or prevention and therefore encounter no financial
> disincentives to not develop in the expanding floodplain; the next
> flood produces even greater damage; this in turn justifies more
> protection; after a brief period, confidence is regained and more

>
> While precipitation amounts associated with Hurricane Katrina were not
> insignificant, the majority of flood-related damages have been
> attributed to Katrina's formidable storm surge. Katrina's massive size
> and strength while over the shallow waters of the Gulf enabled its
> associated storm surge to reach 24--28 ft along a 20-mile-wide swath
> centered roughly on St. Louis Bay in Mississippi. The complete
> devastation of buildings and other infra- structure in the immediate
> vicinity of the storm-surge impact, along with widespread failures of
> tide gages, makes exact estimates of the storm surge very complicated.
> It is known, however, that elevated water levels associated with the
> storm surge reached 6 miles inland in many areas and up to 12 miles
> inland along bays and rivers.
>
> While the storm surge was highest east of the path of the eye of
> Katrina, a significant storm surge was also experienced west of the
> point of land-fall. This resulted in a 14- to 17-foot surge up the
> Mississippi River as well as the man-made Mississippi River--Gulf
> Outlet (MRGO). These two waterways converge at a particularly narrow
> part of the Industrial Canal or Inner Har- bor Navigation Canal
> (IHNC). This "funnel" effect likely intensified the surge, resulting
> in levee overtopping. At the same time, surge entered Lake
> Pontchartrain from the east through various passes and, aided by
> easterly winds, raised the water level of the lake by 10 to 12 ft. The
> rising waters due to this surge and the failure of levees were the
> primary causes behind the widespread flooding experienced by New
> Orleans.
>
> **Flood Damage Reduction Strategy for New Orleans:**
>
> **A Pump and Levee System**
>
> The city of New Orleans is surrounded by over 14 miles of levees and
> flood- walls called the Hurricane Protection System, which buffers the
> city from water-level changes in both Lake Pontchartrain and the
> Mississippi River. This system protects a low-elevation "bowl" between
> these two water bod- ies, reaching as low as 9 ft below the sea level
> in the residential areas near the lake.
>
> When the surge hit New Orleans, several problems with the levees were
> revealed. Although the levees were engineered to withstand a category
> 3 hurricane such as Katrina, the surges that hit the city were more
> consistent with a category 5 hurricane, as the funneling effect of the
> MRGO and other existing hydraulic connections drastically increased
> water velocities and, to a lesser extent, increased the storm-surge
> heights. More specifically, the Hur- ricane Protection System was
> breached in approximately 50 different places. The first 4, and the
> most devastating, of these 50 breaches were from founda- tion
> failures, as the fast-moving storm surge eroded structural support for
> the levee floodwalls. The remaining 46 breaches were from a direct
> overtop- ping of earthen levees and embankments (Fig. 12--4c).

> **Impacts and the Effectiveness of Flood Damage Reduction Strategies**
>
> Katrina was the third deadliest hurricane on record, surpassed only by
> the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane of
> 1928. The official death toll had reached 1836 by May of 2006, with
> 1296 of those in Louisiana and 238 in Mississippi. More than 250,000
> people were dis- placed by the storm, with evacuees seeking shelter in
> all 50 states, but pri- marily in Texas.
>
> The indirect damage estimates from Katrina consist of long-term eco-
> nomic effects that will continue to impact the region for years. The
> oil indus- try was most severely impacted, with crippled pipelines,
> flooded refineries, and damaged, adrift, or capsized oil rigs and
> platforms reducing the daily oil production by 95% immediately after
> the storm. The mass population exo- dus along with millions of lost
> jobs has severely hurt the local economy and caused a major loss of
> tax revenue.
>
> The flood control paradox discussed earlier is very relevant in this
> case study. At the time of publication of this text, the question
> "Should we rebuild?" will has been answered, and the rebuilding of New
> Orleans will likely continue into the future. Changes are in place
> that many hope will reduce the damage susceptibility of this great
> city, including improvements to the pump and levee system,
> improvements in the skill of predicting hur- ricane storm track and
> intensity, and improved storm-surge modeling. One example of these
> upgrades (completed in 2010) is the IHNC Lake Borgne Surge Barrier, a

>
> The year 2008 shocked the Texas coastline with the most destructive

> third costliest storm in the U.S. history, Hurricane Ike brought \$24
> billion in damages and over 20 deaths, thereby reemphasizing our
> nation's vulnerability to natural disasters.
>
> On August 28, 2008, a tropical wave formation, and what would become
> Hurricane Ike, moved off the coast of West Africa. The wave developed
> into a hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 12--5), and after
> reaching its peak intensity as a category 4 storm of 145 mph and 935
> mb on September 4, Hur- ricane Ike made landfall at the Bahamas on
> September 7. On September 8 and 9 the storm made landfall twice in
> Cuba, and by September 11 Hurricane Ike was in the Gulf of Mexico as
> an unusually large category 2 hurricane with a wind field 450 miles in
> diameter (Fig. 12--5). Hurricane Ike made landfall at Galveston,
> Texas, as a category 2 storm on September 13 at 2:10
> [a]{.smallcaps}.[m]{.smallcaps}. CDT with winds of 110 mph and a
> central pressure of 950 mb (Bedient et al., 2011). The damaging storm
> surge during Ike, which may have been worse than expected due to the
> storm's abnormally large wind field, motivated the NWS to enhance its
> analysis and prediction of storm surge and to develop effective ways
> of communicating the associated risks to the public. The National Hur-
> ricane Center's probabilistic storm surge product, which became
> operational in 2009, is one example of this effort (NHC, 2010).

> **IMPROVED STRATEGIES TOWARD FLOOD MANAGEMENT**
>
> The continual increase in flood-related damages, whether resulting
> from tropical storm activity or severe thunderstorms associated with
> more fre- quent frontal activity, illustrates the need to improve our
> flood management strategies at all geographic scales, from local to
> national. Improvements in weather forecasting skill and local efforts
> that rely on structural methods of flood protection will continue to
> play a vital role in reducing flood damages; however, the increasing
> population along coastal areas and in larger, urban centers demands a
> greater reliance on nonstructural methods in both short- and long-term
> flood management strategies. Many cities across the nation are
> participating in Low Impact Development (LID) practices to control
> runoff volume and pollutant loading. More information on the many
> differ- ent approaches to LID is summarized in the next section. A
> different, but equally impactful nonstructural approach that has
> worked successfully in Houston, Texas, is the Rice University/Texas
> Medical Center Flood Alert System (Rice/TMC FAS). The Flood
> Alert/Warnings Systems sections will discuss the role that flood alert
> systems can play in improving flood manage- ment strategies,
> particularly in quickly responding urbanized watersheds. Many other
> radar-based systems are in operation around the United States and
> abroad.
>
> **Low Impact Development (LID)**
>
> The utilization of LID designs is meant to decrease the adverse
> hydrologic effects of construction and urbanization on a given
> watershed and to allow the given area to best mimic predevelopment
> hydrology. LID has recently become very popular for managing urban
> runoff, and there are many differ- ent categories of practices,
> including but not limited to conservation designs, structural and
> landscape designs to increase infiltration, filtration practices to
> treat runoff, and runoff conveyance practices.
>
> Two common LID methods that contribute not only to decreasing rainfall
> runoff but also to filtering rainfall are known as pervious pavement
> and vegetative swales. Both work off of the same principle: replacing
> imper- vious cover, such as concrete, with pervious surfaces that
> allow for rain to percolate through a soil medium acting as a filter
> and flow out of the area at a slower rate. Pervious pavement replaces
> traditional impervious concrete or asphalt with a pervious concrete
> paver that is placed on top of layers of other materials, which
> facilitate the movement of rainfall to a series of drains placed under
> the pavement that transport the percolating water to a desired
> location (ICPI, 2010). Vegetative swales work in a similar manner,
> with the main difference that the swales are self-contained planters
> that typically receive runoff directly from roofs or an impervious
> surface such as the road. The runoff that is collected then percolates
> through the soil medium found in the vegetative swale and is
> discharged at a desired location (PBES, 2011). Another LID practice
> that can be implemented is a rainwater catch- ment system. These
> systems collect water from a catchment surface, such as a roof,
> through a series of gutters, and the water is piped into a large
> cistern for storage. This technique aids not only in decreasing the
> effects of urban- ization on runoff, but also in arid and
> drought-stricken areas; it can be used
>
> to harvest rain water that can be used for drinking water (Mays,
> 2011).
>
> In addition to on-site green infrastructure, conservation designs are
> built on the scale of a neighborhood to preserve open space in order
> to increase either infiltration or evapotranspiration. Higher-density
> development is one method that attempts to accomplish this goal by
> grouping populations in a smaller space, such as a high-rise apartment
> building, in order to vacate other areas that may be used for parks
> and other types of open space. For instance, 4 single-family homes in
> suburbia may occupy one acre of land, whereas apart- ments may take up
> the same amount of space and house 10 or more families. Additionally,
> because the soil on a single-family plot of land is compacted by heavy
> machinery, lawns often behave like impervious surfaces (USEPA, 2006).
> In fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has shown that
> larger lawns do not compensate for the increased runoff that is
> created when a watershed is developed (USDA, 2001). Instead, utilizing
> open space for pocket wetlands, forestry, and parks can help attenuate
> flow and reduce the volume of runoff in a watershed. The San Antonio
> Water System is a good example of how legislation can be used to
> control stormwater runoff and increase the water resources in a
> community. The organization has designated Floodplain Preservation
> Areas, which are located within the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone, to
> limit the amount of activity that is allowed. Furthermore, Floodplain
> Buffer Zones run parallel to the Floodplain Preservation Areas and
> only contain pervious cover (SAWS, 1995). More information on water
> resources in San Antonio can be found in Chapter 13.
>
> LID can have a powerful effect when a number of different techniques
> are combined together in a designated area such as a planned
> community. The Woodlands is a 37-yr-old totally planned community
> north of Houston,
>
> Texas, that, when originally designed in the 1974, used many
> techniques that were precursors to the LID designs we see today. The
> master drainage plan of the development was planned from the beginning
> to minimize any adverse impacts on the 100-yr floodplain. The
> development criterion was to mini- mize any change in the existing,
> undeveloped floodplain at two central points. More than one-third of
> The Woodlands was designated as open space, and is either found in its
> natural state or maintained for recreational use, parklands, or other
> community facilities. Also, to minimize the impact of urbanization on
> the peak runoff response, the drainage system was main- tained in its
> natural state as much as possible to provide higher storage capacity
> and resistance to flow within the channels. Drainage into the major
> water courses is provided by numerous broad, shallow swales with
> slopes generally less than 1%, and they are covered in native
> vegetation to impede stormwater flow (Bedient and Huber, 2002).
>
> **Flood Alert/Warning Systems**
>
> Flood alert/warning systems are becoming more prevalent as tools to
> reduce the flood damage susceptibility of critical areas in watersheds
> throughout the United States. These systems are designed to collect,
> handle, analyze, and disseminate hydrologic information, ideally in
> real time, for the purpose of providing accurate advance warnings of
> an impending flood condition. Their incorporation in existing and
> newly developed flood management strategies should be encouraged. An
> increase in the use of these types of systems is likely, given the
> following factors: the continued growth of com- puter-mediated voice
> and data communication systems, including the Inter- net and
> data-capable wireless devices; the increased availability of
> high-quality hydrologic data, including radar rainfall, LIDAR
> elevation datasets, and GIS-formatted hydrography; and the overall
> resurgence of the nonstructural flood control method as a tool to
> complement flood damage reduction strategies.
>
> Recent technological advances in hydrology and in a number of other
> fields, such as meteorology and computer science, have made available
> a variety of tools capable of increasing the performance of a flood
> alert system. This is particularly true for alert systems designed for
> quickly responding urban watersheds. Some of these advances include
> the continued research in the application of Next Generation Radar
> (NEXRAD), the development of more accurate short-term Quantitative
> Precipitation Forecast algorithms, the development of powerful yet
> efficient distributed parameter and lumped parameter hydrologic models
> that run in real time, and the linkage of all of these advances within
> the ever-improving GIS field (Bedient et al., 2003; Fang et al.,
> 2008).
>
> The above-listed factors have permitted these types of systems to
> successfully issue flood warnings at specific locations with
> increasing lead time at even the small, urban watershed scale. Once
> installed in these
>
> watersheds, and accepted as part of a flood management system, time-
> critical actions that may result in significant costs to both public
> and private organizations can be taken only when necessary and with
> ample time to minimize flood damages.
>
> Traditionally, warnings provided by the NWS for watersheds on the
> order of 100 square miles or less are issued as blanket statements for
> broad areas such as a county or quadrant of a county. These warnings
> are issued quite liberally with the aim of "failing safe"; however,
> the downside to this approach is the frequent false-alarm ratio that
> results, making the public skeptical and hesitant to take action in
> response to future warnings. Further- more, where small-scale warning
> systems do exist as part of an ALERT (Automated Local Evaluation in
> Real Time) System, these systems are typically rain gage based. While
> these gage-based flood alert systems have fulfilled the role of
> providing flood notification to many people and have undoubtedly saved
> millions in both lives and property, they fail to take advantage of
> many of the above-listed technologies to improve lead times and system
> accuracy.
>
> The next section provides a general overview of the development and
> operation of both the original RICE/TMC FAS and the second-generation
> system known as FAS-2. FAS-3 was released in 2010 with marked improve-

> 2011). Figure 12--7 shows the location of Brays Bayou and the Texas

> on rain gage/stream gage for dissemination of warnings. While its
> network is perhaps one of the densest in the world, with approximately

> issuing an alert. This type of reactive approach, while almost never
> issuing a false alarm, is capable of providing only about 30 minutes
> or less of lead time (Bedient et al., 2003).
>
> **The Second-Generation Flood Alert System (FAS2)**
>
> The second generation of the Rice/Texas Medical Center Flood Alert
> Sys- tem, known as FAS2, has been developed with the aim of addressing
> many of the shortfalls of the original system. This process has
> focused on utilizing many advances in the fields of radar sensing,
> real-time hydrologic modeling, and improved information transfer via
> digital systems such as the Internet, PDAs (personal digital
> assistants), and cell phones. Four general areas were identified where
> the existing system could be improved: lead time, accuracy,
> effectiveness, and reliability.
>
> Color-coded flood alert action levels were created for various flow
> levels predicted by the FAS for Brays Bayou at Main Street. The alert
> status was based on nomograph-predicted flows. A flood caution
> (yellow) would be issued for predicted flows between 20,000 ft^3^/s
> and 24,000 ft^3^/s. A height- ened alert status (orange) would be
> issued for predicted flows between 24,000 ft^3^/s and 28,000 ft^3^/s,
> when flooding would be considered possible, given additional rainfall
> over the watershed. A final alert status (red) would be issued for
> predicted flows greater than 28,000 ft^3^/s, signifying that severe
> flooding at the TMC would be probable, given the combination of
> existing flow in the Bayou and current rainfall estimates.
>
> The animated radar rainfall images were available at various time
> peri- ods and scales. For example, end users could request the last 24
> hrs of radar rainfall over the entire southeast Texas area and then
> select the last 3 hrs of detailed data specifically over Brays Bayou.
> These images were routinely used to analyze historical storm movement
> as well as to obtain a qualitative feel for the growth and decay
> trends for individual storm cells.
>
> The FAS's two cameras, called BayouCams, enabled constant visual
> monitoring and verification of flow levels at vital confluences. Prior
> to their installation, TMC security personnel were dispatched to
> physically observe these levels. The images from the BayouCams were
> archived during signifi- cant storm events, providing valuable data
> for post event analysis and system performance evaluation.
>
> Improving the accuracy of the system was accomplished by a variety of
> means, including improved radar data input and resolution, real-time
>
> calibration of the radar with rain gages when available, and the
> development of real-time hydrologic models---both distributed and
> lumped parameter. A real-time interface for the industry-standard
> HEC-1 hydrologic model was developed, permitting the hydrologic
> predictions developed by these models to take greater advantage of the
> spatial and temporal distribution of real- time radar data. This
> real-time hydrologic model also provides significant lead-time
> improvements by providing estimates of when peak flows would actually
> occur.
>
> Information dissemination tools besides the Internet were added to the
> new system, including automated notification via cellular phones,
> pagers, and e-mail. New alert action levels were developed to
> incorporate the increased lead time and accuracy from the new system.
> This had the desired effect of reducing the number of false alarms to
> the TMC. Lastly, the system was tested from start to finish over a
> number of actual storm events. The system has worked very well for 10
> major storms since 2001 with an observed vs. predicted r^2^ value of
> 0.90 FAS2 has generally predicted floods with aver- age differences of
> 0.88 hr for time of peak and 3.6% in peak flows for the overall
> performance. System reliability was also improved by establishing
> multiple server sites at various locations, including Rice University,
> TMC, and Norman, Oklahoma (Fang et al., 2008).
>
> **The Third-Generation Flood Alert System (FAS3)**
>
> The advanced radar-based flood alert system (FAS) has evolved through
> two generations using available technologies and enhancements and has
> played an important role in flood warning and flood control aspects
> for the Texas Medical Center since it debuted. After years of
> urbanization in the watershed, the hydrologic model as a core engine
> in the system has been updated with recent routing information and
> loss rate factors to provide more reliable prediction information.
>
> The system has been recently upgraded into its third generation (fas3.
> flood-alert.org) by incorporating a hydraulic prediction
> tool---Floodplain Map Library (FPML) so that mapped warning
> information in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Google Maps
> can be provided to emer- gency personnel in real time. The FAS3 system
> employs Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) technology to reduce
> web traffic while allow- ing for more timely display of updates. The
> web browser can periodically check with the server to see if an update
> has occurred. In this way, more frequent checks can be performed for
> shorter durations, which is very important for end users under severe
> weather conditions. In addition, with the popularity of Google
> Maps---a web mapping service application and technology provided by
> Google---the FAS3 system displays the FPML within the Google Maps
> frame (FAS3.rice.edu). When rainfall occurs in the watershed, the FAS3
> algorithm determines a floodplain according to a rain- fall intensity
> estimate that is computed over the last 3 hrs of radar rainfall
>
> data. Rainfall estimates are updated whenever the FAS3 server receives
> new data. Showing colored floodplain mapping information in Google
> Maps enables emergency personnel to better understand weather condi-
> tions during any event (Fang et al., 2011).
>
> Chapter 12 introduced essential information concerning floodplain
> management is- sues, flood control alternatives, and flood control
> policy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), the primary agency in
> charge of these issues at the national level, was introduced, and
> several aspects of the agency were discussed. Specifically, the
> chapter focused on recent changes in flood control practice, which are
> now being adopted by the COE. These changes, often in the form of
> encompassing more non- structural flood control measures, have enabled
> a broader and more environmentally conscious approach to floodplain
> management.
>
> Specific examples of both structural and nonstructural flood control
> measures have been presented for the reader to more fully appreciate
> the advantages and disadvantages of each when used in any floodplain
> management scheme. A heavy emphasis was placed on the environmental
> impacts associated with channelization. Additionally, floodplain
> property buyouts and the NFIP were presented as two vi- able
> nonstructural flood control alternatives to traditional, structural
> approaches. The role of the FEMA in flood disasters was briefly
> discussed.
>
> The chapter presents a detailed treatment of Hurricanes Katrina and
> Ike and their enormous impact along the Gulf coast. In particular,
> Katrina created the great- est flood damage (over \$75 billion at time
> of printing) ever seen in a major metro- politan area (surpassing T.
> S. Allison in Houston in June, 2001). Hurricane Ike, the first major
> direct hit on Houston since 1983, damaged more than 2500 homes and
> displaced large numbers of people, while generating the third highest
> damage in his- tory (\$24.9 billion) (Bedient et al., 2012). These
> storms demonstrate the power and fury of Mother Nature in spite of the
> millions that have been spent over the years on floodplain management
> and levee construction, especially in New Orleans.
>
> The chapter concludes with a section on improved strategies for flood
> manage- ment, including low impact development methods and flood
> warning systems. These methods hold great promise for the future to
> help promote sustainable watersheds.

> **INTRODUCTION**
>
> **734**
>
> The next generation of modern hydrologists will face unprecedented
> chal- lenges in dealing with the evaluation and investment in existing
> water resource projects as well as the development of new and
> innovative ones. This chapter explores some world-renowned water
> resources projects that demonstrate hydrologic applications at the
> highest level of achievement. These include projects for the water
> systems in central Texas, the Colorado River basin, and international
> projects on the Thames River near London and in China and Southeast
> Asia.
>
> Central Texas is a prime example of a region facing issues at both
> ends of the spectrum. The complex ground water aquifer system has very
> little long-term storage capacity. Drought, coupled with
> ever-increasing popula- tion growth in the region, has forced water
> managers to address conservation and look toward alternative water
> supply sources to maintain a sustainable system. This region is also a
> part of flash flood alley, an area where the high- est rainfall and
> runoff rates in the country contribute to dangerous flooding. Major
> water projects have been developed to respond to these challenges.
>
> The City of San Antonio, home to 1.3 million people, lies in the midst
> of central Texas. The San Antonio River, running directly through the
> city's
>
> downtown, is one of the premier examples of structural flood control
> used to expand economic opportunity. Levees, dams, tunnels, and sluice
> gates have all been built to control the river and to protect
> downtown. The San Antonio Riverwalk and expanded river reach are
> examples of sustainable water development projects that have become
> the center of a robust tourist economy and the livelihood of the city.
>
> Water issues in the western United States far exceed those of central
> Texas and are some of the most complex in the world. Over 20 million
> people rely on the Colorado River for drinking water and irrigation,
> and much of the
>
> U.S. food supply is produced from farms that use this water. However,
> this unruly source has only recently been tamed. The seven western
> states that rely on the Colorado River came to an agreement in the
> 1920s over the divi- sion of the Colorado River's water, but today the
> annual flow of the river is over allocated. The Colorado River is one
> of the most heavily dammed, reg- ulated, and litigated rivers in the
> United States and serves as a prime example of how important water
> resources are to the fabric of life and culture.
>
> The greatest and most successful dam project on the river was the
> Hoover Dam built in the 1930s. Not long after, Glen Canyon Dam was
> built to guarantee water to the Upper Basin States. Hoover Dam has
> been a great success for many reasons, but Glen Canyon Dam has proven
> to be more of an environmental disaster. Not only has it greatly
> affected flows and wildlife in the Grand Canyon National Park, but its
> reservoir has inundated one of the most awe-inspiring canyons on the
> Colorado River. Internationally, dams have led to heated discussions
> and often their negative effects can outweigh the benefits of
> construction.
>
> The Thames River in England is an example of a coastal river system
> that faces both water quality issues and flooding problems.
> Historically, the Thames River has been contaminated with sewage
> effluent from London for hundreds of years. More recently, a modern
> sanitary sewer system has been designed that carries sewage away from
> the river. Additionally, the Thames River is vulner- able to severe
> flooding from upstream snowmelt and rainfall, as well as tidal
> movements and storm surge. Engineers have installed and designed a
> storm surge barrier to protect London's infrastructure and population.
>
> China is a major developing economy that has enormous water supply,
> flooding, and water quality problems. Many of its rivers have been or
> are being dammed for flood control in many regions, and already there
> have been serious environmental and sediment issues. The recent
> opening of Three Gorges Dam in 1994, the largest in the world, is not
> without a host of problems. The Chinese government also admitted the
> dam has negatively impacted downstream river water, sediment
> transport, and migration of citizens (Kent, 2011).
>
> The above water resources projects provoke a series of important
> questions that puzzle modern engineers: To what extent are we able to
> tame and reroute rivers to serve our needs? How high and how big must
> we build before we become a danger to ourselves? At what point have we
> consumed all the renewable resources in our aquifers? How far must we

> future generations? And finally, what role will climate change play in
> future water resource projects?
>
> The City of San Antonio is the seventh largest city in the United
> States. It is home to 1.3 million people and is the largest city to
> rely solely on ground- water to sustain its population. The unique
> early history of the city sets the stage for the development of an
> economic metropolis located directly on the San Antonio River.
> Although the city receives approximately 29 inches of rain annually,
> rainfall can vary anywhere from 10 to 52 inches in a given year. In
> some years, riverbeds run practically dry causing citizens to worry
> about the state of the aquifer and triggering usage restrictions.
> However, in other years the river flows out of banks wreaking havoc
> and destruction.
>
> Water managers and policy makers in the City of San Antonio have been
> forced to address conservation, flood abatement, and sustainable urban
> planning in a region that relies heavily on a fractured limestone
> aquifer for its major water supply and a river prone to flooding for
> its economic vitality. San Antonio's proven success in conserving and
> managing water has made it a national leader in water supply
> management. For example, the River- walk and expanded river reach is
> one of the most successful water resources projects in the United
> States and has motivated similar development inter- nationally.
>
> **A Brief History of Water Use**
>
> Not long after the Spanish Conquistadores began arriving in Texas in
> 1691, they discovered that the area around what is today San Antonio
> could be a potential colonial frontier north of Mexico and a permanent
> stronghold against French expansion from Louisiana. By the early
> 1700s, the Spanish had built five missions along the banks of the San
> Antonio River, which became the largest concentration of Catholic
> missions in North America (Fig. 13--1).
>
> The missions acted as centers for military, religious, and cultural
> instruction of the native Indians, and the ranching practices
> developed by the Spaniards at the missions later became the basis for
> the U.S. agriculture and cattle industries. One agricultural technique
> used by the Spaniards was to transport water using a series of
> irrigation ditches, dams, and aqueducts known as acequias (Fig 13--2).
> Seven acequia systems linked the five missions creating a 15-mile
> network that was capable of irrigating 3500 acres. This was the first
> municipal water distribution system in the lower 48 states and
> continued to serve as the city's sole water system for almost two
> hundred years (Eckhardt, 2011). Even today, parts of the system are
> still in use.
>
> San Antonio is best known for the historic Battle of the Alamo, where
> a few dozen defenders held their ground while Mexican soldiers laid
> siege to the mission. In the end, Texas gained its independence from
> Mexico at San Jacinto near Houston in 1836, and was annexed into the
> United States in

> 1845\. After the Civil War in 1865, Texas longhorn cattle became
> prized for their hardy nature, and over the two decades immediately
> following the War, cattle drives were a common site throughout the
> state. Cowboys were able to lead the cattle north through Texas,
> Oklahoma, and Kansas for over 20 years, due to ample water supplies
> along the trails. The last big drive was in 1885 when a severe winter
> followed by drought forced many to sell their animals.

> In early 1901, oil was discovered in Texas, and the East Texas Oil
> Field turned out to be massive and oil wells sprang up overnight.
> Further investigation revealed that much of the state sat on oil
> reserves, and the race for the black gold began, an industry very
> dependent on a rich source of water.
>
> In the 1890s, a prominent figure in San Antonio, George Brackenridge,
> observed that spring flows were fluctuating wildly corresponding to
> the amount of rainfall. He was concerned that the springs were not a
> sustainable source of water for the growing population. In response,
> he drilled major artesian wells on his property near the headwaters of
> the San Antonio River, and other citizens began drilling wells due to
> a drought that greatly reduced spring flows. The abundant underground
> resource and the improvement in well drilling methods at the turn of
> the century allowed the expansion of drilling to take place and
> created the platform for substantial urban growth near San Antonio.
>
> **The Edwards Aquifer**
>
> The Edwards Aquifer is the major aquifer serving central Texas and San
> Antonio. About 200 million years ago, central Texas was covered by a
> shallow sea. As this sea oscillated back and forth, the Edwards
> limestone formation was exposed to the elements. During the late
> Cretaceous Period, sediments were deposited on top of the exposed
> rock, trapping the water in the crevices between the old and new
> limestone and forming the Edwards Aquifer. About 70 million years ago,
> wind deposited even more sediments on top of the Edwards formation,
> and the weight of the sed- iments caused faults to form between the
> Edwards Plateau and the Gulf of Mexico. The most visible expression of
> these faults is the Balcones Escarpment which marks the transition of
> the Gulf Coast Prairie to the Texas Hill Country.
>
> Some of the most extreme rainfall-runoff rates in the country occur
> along the Balcones Escarpment. As streams flow across the permeable,
> frac- tured carbonate rocks, their base flow seeps through the rocky,
> clay layer and into the conduits of the recharge zone, an area of
> approximately 1250 square miles (EAA, 2011). Beneath the surface of
> the recharge zone, water flows into the artesian zone of the aquifer.
> Here, the water is under so much pressure between limestone confining
> units that it can reach the surface without pumping, in the form of
> artesian wells or springs. In parts of the aquifer these springs
> seldom go dry, while in others their flow varies greatly from year to
> year. Average groundwater velocities can range from 27 feet/ day to
> 6000 feet/day depending on the region of the aquifer (Ardis and
> Fahlquist, 2004).
>
> Today, the Edwards Aquifer lies beneath eight counties, including the

> **Alternative Sources of Water**
>
> The Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) projects that the population
> served by the aquifer will grow from 1.9 million in 2010 to 3 million
> by 2050 and that annual demand will reach 0.5 million ac-ft. Such

> Antonio Water System (SAWS) has led the charge, developing a 50-year
> water plan that identifies ways to create long-term water storage,
> employ recycling and conservation goals, and develop alterna- tive
> water sources.
>
> One of the most groundbreaking water resource developments was the
> creation of the Twin Oaks Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) facility
> by SAWS. Completed in 2004, at a total cost of \$255 million, the
> facility is located in the Carrizo Aquifer. Water can be injected into
> the sand aquifer, creating a bubble or dome that can be accessed later
> when there is a shortage of water in the Edwards Aquifer. During wet
> years, water is pumped from the Edwards Aquifer into the Carrizo
> Aquifer and stored at the ASR facil- ity. Then, during drought
> periods, the water is returned to the distribution system to meet
> demand. Unlike a surface water reservoir, no water evapo- rates.
> Estimates are that more than 0.1 million ac-ft of water can be stored
> at the facility (SAWS, 2011).
>
> The city has been using recycled water to cool electrical generating
> plants since 1963, and by the year 2000 San Antonio had the nation's
> largest recycled water distribution system (Eckhardt, 2011). More than
> 80 miles of pipeline can provide about 20% of the city's total water
> capacity. Recycled water is supplied to commercial and industrial
> customers for non-potable uses, such as irrigation and cooling, and
> used to supplement base-flow in creeks and streams as well as the San
> Antonio Riverwalk. SAWS has taken the initiative to educate the public
> about the uses of recycled water, encour- aging them to conserve and
> heightening awareness about water shortage issues in the area. This
> effort has been complimented by the development of more efficient home
> appliances and landscaping. Since 1987, despite a 50% increase in
> water users, there has been no increase in water consump- tion (SAWS,
> 2011).
>
> Despite conservation initiatives, the Edwards Aquifer does not have

> looked to the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) in Texas to
> supplement
>
> water supply by piping water from the Lower Colorado River to San
> Anto- nio. The equivalent of 50% of annual withdrawals from the
> Edwards Aqui- fer could be drawn across the pipeline (Earl and
> Votteler, 2005). In 2001, SAWS and LCRA reached an agreement, allowing
> San Antonio to purchase 150,000 ac-ft of water from LCRA for up to 80
> years. The project was esti- mated to cost about \$1 billion, but by
> 2008 the estimated cost of the project had increased by another \$1
> billion and the maximum projected yield decreased to 90,000 ac-ft.
> Then in 2009, the LCRA predicted that regional population growth made

>
> A major drought encompassed much of the United States from 1950--1956,
> beginning in the Southwest and covering 10 states by 1954 (NCDC,
> 2003). In Texas, drought conditions were so severe that the aquifer
> fell to the low- est levels ever recorded. Some farmers reported that
> rain had not fallen on their property for more than seven years and
> the San Marcos Springs, the largest artesian springs in Texas, ran
> completely dry, leading to intense con- cern over the future
> availability and management of the Edwards Aquifer as a water
> resource.
>
> Water managers rely on monitoring wells to measure pressure within the
> aquifer. One of the well records, the J-17 Index Well in San Antonio,
> has been used since 1956 as an indicator of the health of the aquifer.
> The J-17 well is located on a major flowpath of the aquifer and thus
> responds quickly to pressure changes from pumping or recharge.
> Similarly, the levels in the J-17 well can be related to major
> artesian spring flows such as the Comal Springs and San Marcos Springs
> (Fig. 13--4). The absence of spring flow causes rivers to run dry and
> lake levels to decrease dramatically, and aquifer depletion can also
> cause severe environmental damage to the underground ecosystem. The
> Edwards Aquifer is home to many freshwater species of salamander,
> catfish, shrimp, and other organisms, eight of which have been placed
> on the endangered species list.
>
> Historically, the Aquifer was subject to "right of capture" laws,
> allow- ing anyone with wells drilled into the aquifer to use unlimited
> water supplies. This has led to significant depletion of the resource,
> especially as the vol- umes drawn from the aquifer continually
> increase. In 1993, Senate Bill 1477 established the EAA to manage,

> In 1998, the EAA mandated water-use cutbacks to address reduced spring
> flows and alarmingly low aquifer levels for the first time. By 2007,
> the EAA had developed a multiphase plan to reduce aquifer withdrawal

>
> \< 650 ft, \< 640 ft, and \< 630 ft msl and provide withdrawal
> reductions of 20%, 30%, 35%, and 40%.

> Although the EAA mandates the percent withdrawal reduction, it does
> not determine how the cutbacks are met by the individual users. Cities

> During 2011, La Nina conditions encompassed central Texas bringing
> hot, dry air to central Texas and virtually eliminating the hope for
> any rain early in the year. In July 2011, the EAA had declared Stage
> II drought restrictions (SAWS, 2011). The severity of this drought
> concerns water man- agers because, while it is not the longest drought

> the driest and hottest eight-month period on record since 1895 (LCRA,

>
> Texas is accustomed to month- or year-long droughts, leading to
> intense water shortages throughout the state, as discussed in the
> previous sections. However, in some years, intense rainfall exceeding
> 10 inches per day leads to significant flooding. In fact, central
> Texas often receives most of its annual rainfall in a few large events
> rather than steady precipitation throughout the year. Thin soils,
> exposed bedrock and sparse vegetation, as well as steep slopes,
> produce some of the highest runoff rates in the country, making the
> Texas Hill Country the most flash flood-prone area in the United
> States.
>
> The IH-35 corridor, spanning from Dallas to San Antonio, has been
> appropriately named Flash Flood Alley. Streams and rivers receiving
> runoff from the Texas Hill Country compounded with heavy rainfall
> cause massive flooding in the flat, gulf coast plains. Between 1959
> and 2005, 760 flood- related deaths occurred in Texas, ranking it the
> number one for flood-related fatalities, injuries, and casualties
> (Ashley and Ashley, 2008).
>
> In central Texas, peak discharges occur much more quickly than in
> other watersheds due to the slope and intensity of rainfall, catching
> residents off guard and putting them in the way of the flood.
> Floodplain maps are often subject to political pressures and may be

> The San Antonio River has always been a unique resource for the city
> of San Antonio. Initially, it provided the water needed to sustain the

> resource. Over the years, citizens have debated the existence of the
> river and tried to develop the best management practices to address
> the many issues surrounding the river, such as drought, flood control,
> and water quality (Fig. 13--6).
>
> The vitality of the San Antonio River is tied closely to the health of
> the aquifer and the amount of rainfall in a given year. The headwaters
> of the river originate at the Blue Hole, a famous spring north of
> downtown San Antonio. From there, the river passes through downtown

> In the 1890s, when the citizens of San Antonio began relying on arte-
> sian and shallow wells for their water supply rather than surface
> water, the river level was significantly depleted. In response, the
> mayor of the City of San Antonio created the City Planning Committee
> in 1910 and began re- beautification efforts along the river banks.
> There were three primary pro- posals for beautifying the river, and
> the combination has created the basis for the Riverwalk today:

1.  Thirteen miles of stone bridges and park along the river,

2.  Channelize the river near downtown to control for flooding,

3.  Build the shops along the river near downtown San Antonio designed
    > to create a Venetian-like atmosphere to stimulate economic growth
    > in the heart of San Antonio.

> Re-beautification efforts met serious opposition when, between 1914
> and 1921, six major floods occurred in downtown San Antonio. The worst
> of these occurred in 1921, when parts of downtown were inundated by as
> much as 10 feet of water. Significant loss of life and property
> prompted city officials to propose cementing over the river and
> turning it into a piped sewer system to prevent downtown from future
> floods. Luckily, the citizens of San Antonio protested and took other
> measures to protect downtown from flooding.
>
> Olmos Dam was completed in 1926 at the cost of \$1.5 million and was
> built to contain water accumulating in the Olmos Creek watershed north
> of downtown. The area behind the dam has been turned into park and
> recre- ational facilities that flood during heavy rainfall. With a
> spillway length of 1152 feet, the dam was designed to hold vast
> quantities of water. There are six floodgates to release water into
> Olmos Creek at the downstream side of the dam, which provide
> significant protection for areas of northern San Antonio. In 1929, the
> city completed a second flood control measure: the cutoff channel. The
> cutoff channel was designed to allow floodwaters to bypass the "Great
> Bend" portion of downtown and is controlled by a series of flood-
> gates located at the entrance and exit to the great bend. When the
> river reaches a certain stage, the gates are closed and the water is
> diverted away from downtown. This portion of the river is home to
> shops and restaurants that act as the city's main downtown attraction.

> The most impressive engineering accomplishment in the City of San
> Antonio was a tunnel 140 feet beneath the city that diverts
> floodwaters before they reach downtown and the Riverwalk, controlling
> the river stage in the downtown area. The project was completed in
> 1997 at the cost of \$111 million. The tunnel runs for 3 miles beneath
> the city and carries water down- stream where wider channels can
> handle the excess floodwaters. The tunnel functioned perfectly during
> both the 1998 and 2002 storms when 30 inches of rainfall fell on the
> city in 48 hours. Had the tunnel not been in place at the time of the
> storm, the damage to the city could have been catastrophic.
>
> In 1996, the San Antonio River Improvements Project was initiated.
> Approximately 13 miles of river, from Brackenridge park to the last
> mission in South San Antonio, is being restored at the cost of \$358
> million. Engineers and urban planners re-evaluated floodplain extents
> and designed a green space consisting of pocket parks, paddling and
> bike trails, and wildlife habi- tat to provide flood storage and a
> recreational outlet for citizens. The unique culture of the city of

> The river begins in the mountains of Colorado, flowing through the

> In 1896, the privately owned California Development Company began to
> construct irrigation canals to the Imperial Valley in Southern
> California. A canal was built along the old Alamo River, an overflow
> channel of the main river, and was routed up to the Salton Sea in
> California. The Salton Sea exists as a result of periodic flooding and

> Imperial Canal, Colorado River water finally reached the Valley in

> President Theodore Roosevelt began federal reclamation of the Amer-
> ican Southwest by enacting the Reclamation Act of 1902 (USBR, 2006).
> The theory was to "reclaim" the arid lands for human use through
> irrigation (www.usbr.gov). The Act created the means for federally
> funded irriga- tion projects by setting aside money from the sale of
> public land, which would be used to build and maintain irrigation
> works in the western 13 states. The newly irrigated lands encouraged
> people to move west where they could grow crops on fertile soils,
> relying on a steady source of water. The irrigated land, now more
> valuable, was sold and the money put back into the revolv- ing
> irrigation fund (Loring, 2004).
>
> Reclamation was not an easy fix to conquering the west, as the unruly
> river and erratic flows provided many irrigation challenges in the
> early 1900s, especially in the lower stretches of the river. Flow in
> the Colorado is highly variable, fluctuating between 6 and 20 million
> ac-ft annually (Carriquiry and Sanchez, 1999). Peak flows coincide
> with the spring snow melt, but during other times of the year its flow
> can be much lower, limiting its ability to irrigate all the dependant
> farmland. Also, the violent spring floods require sufficient and
> expensive levees to contain and direct the water, while at the same
> time the highly turbid water deposits enormous amounts of sediment. It
> was estimated that the river in its natural, red-colored state carried
> 160 mil- lion tons of sediment each year (Carriquiry and Sanchez,
> 1999). This massive load of sediment clogged man-made canals after a
> large flood, and required expensive repairs each time.

> Aside from flood control problems, water salinity is the biggest water
> quality issue in the Colorado, and can result in completely useless
> water. Salinity concentrations in the headwaters of the Colorado are
> less than 50 mg/L, but concentrations increase downstream
> dramatically, reaching about 900 mg/L near the Mexico border
> (pubs.usgs.gov). Many of the miner- als come from the saline soils in
> the high plains of Colorado and Arizona, but agricultural irrigation
> also is a significant contributor. In fact, water flow- ing in the
> lowest reaches of the river has been re-used, on average, three times
> for irrigation purposes, allowing it to leach more minerals from the
> soil and become more saline (Fradkin, 1996). Urbanization, population
> growth, mining, agricultural practices, and recreation all affect

> For the people of the Southwestern United States, the Colorado River

> In June 1931, workers began diverting the Colorado River. Four diver-
> sion tunnels 56 feet in diameter and nearly 3 miles in total length
> were blasted through the walls of the canyon (USBR, 2006) (Fig.
> 13--9). When the tunnels were completed in November 1933, engineers
> redirected the flow of the river using two temporary cofferdams made
> of rock and earth to lift the water into diversion channels. The upper
> cofferdam was built just below the opening of the four tunnels to
> divert the flow of the Colorado River down the tunnels. On November
> 14, 1932, the flow of the Colorado River successfully wound its way
> around the work site, and the task of excavating the construction site
> began.

> Engineers were tasked with designing spillways, intake towers, pen-
> stock and outlet systems, and powerhouse and switching stations as
> well to hydroelectric generation. These components were no less
> important and very often no less difficult to construct than the dam
> face. The spillways located on each side of the dam were responsible

> and penstocks that would pull water from the reservoir through 41 feet
> tunnels lined with 2 feet of concrete and massive thick plate steel
> pipes. The intake towers sat on ledges that were cut out of the canyon
> approximately 260 feet above the river bed in order to provide a basin
> for silt settling. The towers would be connected to tunnels that would
> drop 200 feet straight down and connect to a series of underground
> tunnels that flowed into the dam.

> **Glen Canyon Dam**
>
> After the construction of the Hoover Dam, the government needed to
> pro- vide a means with which water could be regulated to ensure that
> the Lower Basin and Upper Basin states would receive their rightful
> allotments of water. After negotiating with the Sierra Club regarding
> multiple dam sites, Congress authorized the Colorado River Storage Act
> on April 1956, which ensured the delivery of allotted water
> downstream. The construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in northern
> Arizona began on June 1960, and the final concrete was poured on
> September 1963. The Glen Canyon Dam towered over the landscape at 710
> feet tall, and created a reservoir, Lake Powell, with 26 million ac-ft
> of storage stretching over 186 miles of the Colorado River that took
> 17 years to fill. The Glen Canyon Dam is infamous for the serious
> environmental damage it has caused (www.usbr.org).
>
> David Brower, the executive director of the Sierra Club at the time of
> completion, called the Glen Canyon Dam "America's most regretted
> environmental mistake." In fact, Glen Canyon was one of the most beau-
> tiful canyons along the Colorado River before it was inundated with
> water (Fig. 13--11). Post-construction, numerous environmental
> concerns have arisen. For instance, under natural conditions the flow
> through the Grand Canyon would range between 3000 and 90,000 cubic
> feet per second and carry massive amounts of silt. Now that the Glen
> Canyon Dam is regulat- ing water flow, the annual flows range between
> 8000 and 20,000 cubic feet per second and are virtually sediment free
> (livingrivers.net). The natural high and fluctuating flows served as a
> conveyor of sediment to build beaches, rejuvenate and replenish the
> shorelines, as well as create sand- bars that supported calm,
> backwater areas for fish to utilize, while the low flows were
> essential in juvenile fish survival. Instead, the fluctuating, often
> lower, sediment-free flows seen erode the sand bars and allow
> vegetation to encroach upon areas that are not naturally vegetated.

> Sediment and flow issues are not the only environmental problems cre-

> Glen Canyon Dam is wasteful of significant volumes of water each year.
> Lake Powell alone loses 2600 gallons of water per minute to
> infiltration in the canyon walls (www.usbr.gov), nearly 0.86 million
> ac-ft of water annually. While this is a small number when compared to
> Lake Powell's total capacity (around 3%), it constitutes nearly 6% of
> the river's annual flow, and together with Lake Mead the two
> reservoirs account for a 10% loss of flow (glencan- yon.org). In a
> region that relies heavily upon the Colorado River for multiple
> purposes, water lost to evaporation is simply unsustainable.

> In 1983, a greater than average snowmelt caused significant flooding
> upstream of Glen Canyon Dam. As upstream dams began releasing their
> flows, the Glen Canyon Dam became overwhelmed. Engineers opened the

> **ACROSS THE POND---THE RIVER THAMES**
>
> The Thames River, one of the most famous in all of Europe, flows 205
> miles from the Thames Head, in the Cotswold Hills, through Southern
> England before emptying into the North Sea near London. It is the
> longest river in England and drains approximately 5500 square miles.
> The last 65 miles of the river are an estuary where the salt water
> fresh water barrier fluctuates daily. In London, the incoming tide can
> raise the river up to 7 meters during the spring, reversing its flow
> through the estuary (Encyclo- pedia Britannica, 2011).
>
> Historically, this river suffers from overuse and neglect. Runoff from
> waste and sewage has severely contaminated the river for decades, a
> prob- lem that has only recently been addressed by authorities. In
> addition, severe storms in the North Sea can inundate London with
> storm surge. Storm surge is the phenomena brought on by high winds and
> shallow bathymetry when a wall of water is pushed ahead of a storm and
> onto land. To combat these issues, engineers have constructed a series
> of water resource projects that mitigate the effects of contamination
> and flooding.
>
> Much of the early Victorian sewer network is still in use today for
> the movement of water and contaminants, but as London continues to
> grow, the system becomes ever more taxed. During heavy rains, the
> sewer system overflows, affecting plant and animal life and presenting
> a serious human health risk. The Thames Tideway Scheme is a project
> currently in progress that introduces two new storage-and-transfer
> tunnels as well as capacitance improvements to three wastewater
> treatment plants. The tunnels will reduce overflow into the River
> Thames and Lee, moving it to the treatment facilities instead. The
> Thames Tunnel is to be constructed between 2013 and 2020. It
>
> will be more than 20 miles long and 25 feet in diameter, flowing
> parallel to the River Thames. The tunnel is designed to remove 96% of
> the sewage entering the Thames annually (NRI, 2011).
>
> **Flooding and the Barrier**
>
> Floods on the River Thames often occur because of large storms,
> upstream flooding, extreme tidal movement, or severe storm surge. The
> combined effect of any of these can be catastrophic. In 1928, 14
> people died when all four causes occurred simultaneously (Encyclopedia
> Britannica, 2011). Snow- melt and unusually heavy rainfall coupled
> with spring tides and storm surge filled London's streets with four
> feet of water. Thousands of people lost their homes and the city's
> infrastructure was significantly damaged.
>
> In 1953, another major storm in the North Sea damaged the English
> coastline and sea walls. Floods carried entire structures out to sea,
> leaving 24,000 properties seriously damaged. In the United Kingdom,
> 300 people died because of the storm. These significant events, along
> with smaller ones, prompted the construction of the Thames Barrier,
> the world's second largest movable flood barrier (completed in 1982).
> Built downstream of London, it spans 1700 feet across, and protects
> over 33,000 acres from flooding (Envi- ronment Agency, 2011a).
>
> The Thames Barrier is made up of 10 steel gates, 65 feet high. There
> are two types of gates: falling radial gates and rising sector gates.
> The falling radial gates are situated above the non-navigable portions
> of the river while the rising sector gates rest on the river bed,
> allowing ship traffic to pass. The gates can be maneuvered into four
> positions: open, closed, under spill, and maintenance. The entire
> structure can be readied for flooding within 90 minutes (Environment
> Agency, 2011a).
>
> The flood barrier protects significant infrastructure, including his-
> torical landmarks, government buildings, businesses, schools,
> hospitals, etc. However, it leaves the entire downstream Thames
> estuary vulnerable to severe storms. Estuaries have significant
> capacity to store storm surge and help mitigate the effects of severe
> storms. In 2002, England established the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan, a
> flood risk management plan that takes into consideration climate
> change and socioeconomic change. The Plan would allow the river to
> reclaim its floodplain near the estuary to reduce the impacts of
> flooding in London (Environment Agency, 2011b). This non- structural
> alternative reflects opinions of water managers worldwide and is one
> effort to consider the true future impacts of climate change in
> Europe.

> dam removal project in American history has begun in 2011 (Yardley,

> millennia and have claimed more than 1 million lives in the past
> century. In order to control flooding and develop a future source of

> Completed in 2006, at a cost of \$28 billion, the dam is 1 mile wide

> In southern China, eight hydroelectric dams have been proposed on the
> Mekong River, which will be capable of storing half of the river's
> flow.
>
> Despite the incredible electric capacity of these dams, they have been
> heav- ily protested. After leaving China, the Mekong River flows for
> 2800 miles through Southeast Asia and into Cambodia and Vietnam,
> providing food to over 60 million people (Pearce, 2009). The potential
> political and environ- mental impacts of damming the Mekong River are
> huge. Not only will China have complete control over the flow of the
> river to its downstream neigh- bors, but the dam will greatly reduce
> the productivity of the fishing industry, the lifeline of these south
> Asian countries. The Tonle Sap, a tributary to the Mekong, is the
> world's second largest inland fishery. In summer, the Mekong's annual
> flood reverses the flow in the Tonle Sap contributing to its
> productivity. The Chinese dams have the capacity to forever destroy
> this ecosystem and its productivity.

> Often structures can exacerbate the impacts of natural disasters. For

# Properties of Water

> The principal physical properties of water are summarized in Table
> C--1. They are described briefly below.
>
> **SPECIFIC WEIGHT**
>
> The specific weight of a fluid, g, is the gravitational attractive
> force acting on a unit volume of a fluid. In SI units, the specific
> weight is expressed as kilo- newtons per cubic meter (kN/m^3^). At
> normal temperatures, g is 9.81 kN/m^3^ (62.4 lb/ft^3^).
>
> **DENSITY**
>
> The density of a fluid, r, is its mass per volume. For water, r is
> 1000 kg/m^3^ (1.94 slug/ft^3^) at 4°C. There is a slight decrease in
> density with increasing temperature. The relationship between g, r,
> and the acceleration due to gravity *g* is g = r*g*.

> The viscosity of a fluid, m, is a measure of its resistance to

> **DYNAMIC VISCOSITY**
>
> In many problems concerning fluid motion, the viscosity appears with
> the density in the form m r, and it is convenient to use a single term
> n, known as the kinematic viscosity. The kinematic viscosity of a
> liquid, expressed as square meters per second (m^2^/s) in SI units,

> Surface tension of a fluid, s, is the physical property that enables a
> drop of water to be held in suspension at a tap, a glass to be filled
> with liquid slightly above the brim and yet not spill, and a needle to
> float on the surface of a liquid. The surfacetension force across any
> imaginary line at a free surface is proportional to the length of the
> line and acts in a direction perpendicular to it. In SI units, surface
> tension is expressed as newtons per meter (N/m). There is a slight
> decrease in surface tension with increasing temperature.

> Vapor pressure is the partial pressure exerted by gas phase molecules

> condensation. The pressure ex- erted by this gas, or vapor, is known
> as the vapor pressure r~n~. In SI units the vapor pressure is
> expressed as kilopascals (kPa) or kilonewtons per square meter
> (kN/m^2^). Vapor pressure increases with decreasing intermolecular
> forces and increasing temperature.

>
> V*flo*™ is a physics-based distributed model that preserves the
> spatial variation of slope, hydraulic roughness, infiltration, and
> rainfall input within a gridded representation of the watershed. The
> model uses a numerical solu- tion of the kinematic wave equations to
> simulate overland and channel flow from rainfall runoff. Gridded
> parameters are derived from geospatial data and physical
> characteristics defining soil infiltration/moisture, channel and
> overland hydraulics, and rating curves. High-resolution rainfall rates
> from radar or rain gage sensors allow detailed predictions within the
> drainage network compris- ing the watershed. The desktop edition of
> V*flo*™ is used to setup and calibrate the model for continuous or
> event-based simulation. In continuous simulation using long-term radar
> rainfall input covering days, months, or years, V*flo*™ generates a
> time series of discharge, runoff volume, and soil moisture for watch
> points. The continuous model may be configured to output distributed
> maps of discharge and stage, or infiltration depths for recharge
> studies. Optional mod- ules for V*flo*™ provide functionality such as
> Inundation mapping, Automatic Calibration, Parameter Sensitivity, and
> spatially and temporally dynamic design storms. V*flo*™ can be run in
> real-time for hydrologic prediction of discharge or stage/inundation
> depths. Real-time applications include flood warning and emergency
> notification.
