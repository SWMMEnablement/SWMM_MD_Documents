FOREWARD

The Environmental Protection Agency was created because of increasing public and governmental concern about the dangers of pollution to the health and welfare of the American people. Noxious air, foul water, and spoiled land are tragic testimony to the deterioration of our natural environment. The complexity of that environment and the interplay between its components require a concentrated and integrated attack on the problem.

Research and development is that necessary first step in problem solution and it involves defining the problem, measuring its impact, and searching for solutions. The Municipal Environmental Research Laboratory develops new and improved technology and systems for the prevention, treatment, and management of wastewater and solid and hazardous waste pollutant discharges from municipal and community sources, for the preservation and treatment of public drinking water supplies, and to minimize the adverse economic, social, health, and aesthetic effects of pollution. This publication is one of the products of that research; a most vital communications link between the researcher and the user community.

Mathematical models are an important tool for use in analysis of quantity and quality problems resulting from urban storm water runoff and combined sewer overflows. This report is an updated user's manual and documentation for one of the first of such models, the EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Detailed instructions on the use of the model are given and its use is illustrated with case studies.

**PREFACE**

**There is seemingly never enough time to write a manual and document a computer program in the manner it deserves. This** SWMM Version **III User's Manual has been under preparation in one form or another for six years, yet it will be found upon examination that some aspects of the model are covered in much more detail than others, and some coverage is downright sparse, notably case studies. The tendency to add "one more thing" to the model has unfortunately proven all too irresistable, to the detriment of as much testing and demonstration as would be desirable. Nonetheless, with a few exceptions most coding is** not radically new; **much deals just with improved input/output. Hence, much reliance has been placed on the continuous testing of the model during its development over the past 12 years.**

**Writing of the various text has also been accomplished in steps. Hence, references on various topics, e.g., snowmelt, storage/treatment, were current at the time of writing which may have been two or three years ago. SWMM quality routines are most continually in a state of** flux due to new developments in the literature. The user should remain **familiar** with **current** information **and** alter his/her modeling practices as necessary.

Some parts of the model are completely new, some are similar if not identical to the first release in 1971. The most significant change since the 1975 Version II release is the inclusion of the Extended Transport Block for quantity routing. This is documented separately by Camp, Dresser and McKee in an addendum to this volume. Other major changes include: continuous simulation, completely revised storage/ treatment routines, snowmelt, surface quality generation, a statistical analysis block, updated graphical and tabular output, and scour-deposition computations in the Transport Block. Parts of the model that remain basically unchanged include the flow routing techniques of the Runoff and Transport Blocks. From a software point of view, the program is no shorter, but nor is it much longer for any particular block.

An attempt has been made to provide adequate information in this manual for most users to conceptualize a stormwater problem and simulate it using SWMM. As a result, some of the text is rather lengthy, approach­ing a hydrology textbook in style in places. Unfortunately, it will still be the user's responsibility to seek out the proper references for additional information on modeling, especially when dealing with water quality.

> The authors hope that the user is not "put *off"* by the length of this volume and the size of the SWMM program. Aside from the fact that it requires a large computer core (about 400 K bytes) the program may often be easily and usefully run with a minimum of input, say a dozen data cards. For small systems in which time step requirements are not severe, the model is very economical as well, and is within the reach of most users. It is by no means the only engineering tool of its kind available, but it has bene­fited greatly from its longevity and feedback from model users. The authors hope such feedback will continue, and earnestly solicit suggestions for improvements. Although no major support for model changes is likely to be forthcoming, the EPA Storm Water and Water Quality Model Users Group (form­erly the SWMM Users Group) remains a convenient forum. Announcements of corrections, changes and new options will be made through that group, man­aged by Mr. Thomas O. Barnwell, EPA, Athens, Georgia 30605.

ABSTRACT

The EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is a comprehensive mathematical model for simulation of urban runoff quantity and quality in storm and combined sewer systems. All aspects of the urban hydrologic and quality cycles are simulated, including surface runoff, transport through the drainage network, storage and treatment, and receiving water effects. (The latter component is currently under revision by the EPA.) This volume applies to Version III of SWMM and is an update of two earlier User's Manuals issued in 1971 and 1975. It should be coupled with Addendum I in order to run the Extran Block (detailed hydraulic flow routing) developed by Camp, Dresser and McKee.

Detailed descriptions are provided herein for all blocks (except the Receiving Water Block): Runoff, Transport, Storage/Treatment, Combine, Statistics and Graph (part of the Executive Block). The latter three blocks are "service" blocks while the first three are the principal computational blocks. In addition, extensive documentation of new procedures is provided in the text and in several appendices.

This report was submitted in partial fulfillment of cooperative agreement CR-805664 by the University of Florida under the sponsorship of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Work was completed as of November 1981.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

> Maintenance and updating of the EPA SWMM has been continuous since its inception in 1969-70. Over the several intervening years, many individuals have contributed to its improvement, most notably EPA col­leagues Richard Field, Harry Torno, Chi-Yuan Fan, Doug Ammon and Tom Barnwell. Harry Torno and Tom Barnwell have also managed the SWMM Users Group, through which many helpful suggestions for improvements have come, including those from the large contingent of Canadian users.

> Regarding specific components of SWMM Version III, the Green-Ampt infiltration routines were reviewed, programmed and tested by Dr. Russell G. Mein, Department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia while on a sabbatical at the University of Florida. He also provided valuable review and testing of other model components. The earliest implementation of continuous simulation in the Runoff and Storage/Treatment Blocks was done by George F. Smith, now with the Office of Hydrology, National Weather Service, Silver Spring, Maryland. Basic formulation of the snowmelt routines was done following the work of Proctor and Redfern, Ltd. and James F. MacLaren, Ltd., Toronto, who were under contract to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and the Canadian Environmental Protection Service. Runoff Block surface quality changes were the subject of masters research at the University of Florida by Douglas C. Ammon, now with the EPA, Storm and Combined Sewer Branch, Cincinnati. Revision of Transport Block scour/deposition routines is based on work with Dennis Lai, Clinton-Bogert Associates, Fort Lee, New Jersey. Many lasting improvements in SWMM programming were made by W. Alan Peltz, now with General Electric, Atlanta.
>
> Several others contributed to changes in the model. The card ID system and the user-defined default values and ratios were suggested by the Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering Center, Davis, California. The programming basis has been aided by Dr. William James, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario and exposure to his FASTSWMM programs. Emphasis upon proper use and objectives of SWMM modeling has been enhanced by conversations with the late Murray McPherson, Marblehead, Massachusetts, Eugene Driscoll, Oakland, New Jersey, Dr. Dominic DiToro, Manhattan College, New York City, John Mancini, Lincoln, Nebraska, Dr. Paul Wisner, Ottawa University, Charles Howard, Vancouver, B.C., and several others. OF is additionally grateful to Reinhard Sprenger, Templeton Engineering, Winnipeg, for improvements to the Extran Block, to Christian Eicher, Gore and Storrie, Ltd., Toronto, for several important corrections to the overall program, to Robert Johnson, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for comments on the compatability with CDC machines, to Tom Jewell, Union College, Schenectady, New York, for analysis of surface

SECTION 1  
INTRODUCTION

> URBAN RUNOFF ANALYSIS
>
> Urban runoff quantity and quality constitute problems of both a historical and current nature. Cities have long assumed the responsibil­ity of control of stormwater flooding and treatment of point sources (e.g., municipal sewage) of wastewater. Within the past two decades, the severe pollution potential of urban non-point sources, principally combined sewer overflows and stormwater discharges, has been recognized, both through field observation and federal legislation. The advent of modern, high speed computers has led to the development of new, complex, sophisticated tools for analysis of both quantity and non-point pollution problems. The EPA Storm Water Management Model, SWMM, developed in 1969-71, was one of the first of such models, but is by no means the only one. Since its original development, it has been continually maintained and updated, and is perhaps the best known and most widely used of the available urban runoff quantity/quality models.
>
> Many of the changes that have occured to SWMM during the past Len years have been poorly documented and not readily visible to users. This volume includes documentation (of both the theory and programming details) of major changes to the model since its original development. This documentation is located primarily in the appendices whereas the text consists primarily of the User's Manual. Theory that underlies unchanged parts of the model may still be reviewed in the original documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, 1971b, 1971c, 1971d) plus intermediate reports (Huber et al., 1975, Heaney et al., 1975).
>
> URBAN RUNOFF MODELS  
> <u>Objectives</u>
>
> Models are generally used for studies of quantity and quality problems associated with urban runoff in which four broad objectives may be identified: screening, planning, design and operation. Each objective typically produces models with somewhat different characteristics, and the different models overlap to some degree.
>
> <u>Screening Models</u>
>
> Screening models are preliminary, "first-cut" ("Level I"), desktop procedures that require no computer. They are intended to provide a
>
> first estimate of the magnitude of urban runoff quantity and quality problems, prior to an investment of time and resources into more complex computer based models. Only after the screening model indicates its necessity should one of the latter models be used. Examples of screening models include SWMM Level I procedures (Heaney et al., 1976, Heaney and Nix, 1977) and others: Howard (1976), Hydroscience (1976, 1979), Chan and Bras (1979).
>
> <u>Planning Models</u>
>
> Planning models are used for an overall assessment of the urban runoff problem as well as estimates of the effectiveness and costs of abatement procedures. They may also be used for "first-cut" analyses of the rainfall-runoff-process and illustrate trade-offs among various control options. They are typified by relatively large time steps (hours) and long simulation times (months and years), i.e., continuous simulation. Data requirements are kept to a minimum and their mathemati­cal complexity is low.
>
> Various continuous simulation models are reviewed in Appendix I. SWMM has had this capability since 1976, following the earliest work of the Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966) and the later widely used Corps of Engineers STORM model (Roesner et al., 1974, HEC, 1977a).
>
> A planning model may also be run to identify hydrologic events that may be of special interest for design or other purposes. These storm events may then be analyzed in detail using a more sophisticated design model. Planning or longterm models may also be used to generate initial conditions (i.e., antecedent conditions) for input to design models. They may occasionally be coupled to continuous receiving water models as well; for example, SWMM and STORM may be used as input to Medina's (1979) Level III Receiving Water Model.
>
> <u>Design Models</u>
>
> Design models are oriented toward the detailed simulation of a single storm event. They provide a complete description of flow and pollutant routing from the point of rainfall through the entire urban runoff system and often into the receiving waters as well. Such models may be used for accurate predictions of flows and concentrations anywhere in the rainfall/runoff system and can illustrate the detailed and exact manner in which abatement procedures or design options affect them. As such, these models are a highly useful tool for determining least-cost abatement procedures for both quantity and quality problems in urban areas. Design models are generally used for simulation of a single storm event and are typified by short time steps (minutes) and short simulation times (hours). Data requirements may be moderate to very extensive depending upon the particular model employed.
>
> In its original form (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, 1971b, 1971c, 1971d), SWMM was strictly a design model. However, as described above,
>
> 2 1-2
>
> it may now be used in both a planning and design mode. In addition, it has acquired additional design potential through inclusion of the Extended Transport Model, EXTRAN, developed by Camp, Dresser and McKee (formerly Water Resources Engineers). EXTRAN is probably the most sophisticated program available in the public domain for detailed hydraulic analysis of sewer systems (Shubinski and Roesner, 1973, Roesner et al., 1981).
>
> <u>Operational Models</u>
>
> Operational models are used to produce actual control decisions during a storm event. Rainfall is entered from telemetered stations and the model is used to predict system responses a short time into the future. Various control options may then be employed, e.g., in-system storage, diversions, regulator settings.
>
> These models are frequently developed from sophisticated design models and applied to a particular system. Examples are operational models designed for Minneapolis-St. Paul (Bowers et al., 1968) and Seattle (Leiser, 1974).
>
> <u>Other Models</u>
>
> SWMM is by no stretch of the imagination the only urban runoff model available, or necessarily the preferred one under many circum­stances. Many other urban runoff models have been described in the literature and are too numerous to list here. However, good comparative reviews are available, e.g., Brandstetter (1977), Chu and Bowers (1977), Huber and Heaney (1979, 1980). In spite of the scores of models described in the literature, Huber and Heaney (1979, 1980) identified only 14 operational (i.e., documented, tested and available for general use) water <u>quality</u> models. A much larger number of strictly hydrologic and hydraulic models is available.
>
> DEVELOPMENT OF THE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT MODEL
>
> Under the sponsorship of the Environmental Protection Agency, a consortium of contractors -- Metcalf and Eddy, Incorporated, the Univer­sity of Florida, and Water Resources Engineers, Incorporated -- developed in 1969-71 a comprehensive mathematical model capable of representing urban stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflow phenomena. The SWMM portrays correctional devices in the form of user-selected options for storage and/or treatment with associated estimates of cost. Effectiveness is portrayed by computed treatment efficiencies and modeled changes in receiving water quality.
>
> The original project report is divided into four volumes. Volume I, the "Final Report" (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a), contains the background, justifications, judgements, and assumptions used in the model development. It further includes descriptions of unsuccessful modeling techniques that were attempted and recommendations for forms of user teams to implement systems analysis techniques most effectively. Although many modifications and improvements have since been added to
>
> 3 1-3
>
> the SWMM, the material in Volume I still accurately describes much of the theory behind updated versions. Documentation of some of the proce­dures included in the 1975 Version II release of SWMM is provided by Heaney et al. (1975).
>
> Volume II, "Verification and Testing," (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971b), describes the methods and results of the application of the original model to four urban catchments.
>
> Volume III, the "User's Manual" (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971c) contains program descriptions, flow charts, instructions on data prepara­tion and program usage, and test examples. This was updated in 1975 by the Version II User's Manual (Huber et al., 1975). This present report supersedes both of these previous two documents.
>
> Volume IV, "Program Listing" (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971d),
>
> lists the entire original program and Job Control Language (JCL) as used in the demonstration runs. Since many routines in the updated version are similar or identical to the original, it is still a useful reference, but on the whole should be disregarded since the present coding is in many cases, completely different.
>
> All three original contractors have continued to modify and improve the SWMM, as have numerous other users since its release. Through EPA research grants, the University of Florida has conducted extensive . research on urban runoff and SWMM development, and has evolved into an unofficial "clearinghouse" for SWMM improvements. There has clearly been a large benefit from the fact that SWMM is in the public domain and non-proprietary since the present version reflects the input and critical assessments of over ten years of user experience. Of course, lingering "bugs" are the responsibility of the present report authors alone.
>
> As described earlier, this report is both a SWMM Version III User's Manual and also documentation of new procedures. As much as possible, input formats for large card groups (e.g., input of subcatchment informa­tion) are compatible with earlier versions and will not necessarily have to be rearranged. However, some changes are quite visible, such as a two-column identifier on each card (in the manner of Hydrologic Engineer­ing Center programs). Hence, it must be assumed by the user that all input must be prepared anew for this SWMM version.
>
> OVERALL SWMM DESCRIPTION  
> <u>Overview</u>
>
> The comprehensive Storm Water Management Model uses a high speed digital computer to simulate real storm events on the basis of rainfall (hyetograph) inputs and system (catchment, conveyance, storage/treatment, and receiving water) characterization to predict outcomes in the form of quantity and quality values. The simulation technique -- that is, the dynamic representation of the physical systems identifiable within the
>
> 4 1-4
>
> model -- was selected because it permits relatively easy interpretation and great versatility and flexibility in model representation of prototype situations.
>
> Since the program objectives are particularly directed toward both complete time and spatial effects and also to gross effects (such as total pounds of pollutant discharged in a given storm), it is considered essential to work with both continuous curves (magnitude versus time), referred to as hydrographs and "pollutographs," and with daily, monthly, annual and total simulation summaries (for continuous simulation).
>
> An overview of the Model structure is shown in Figure 1-1. In simplest terms the program is constructed in the form of "blocks" as follows:

1)  The input sources:

> The Runoff Block generates surface runoff based on arbi­trary rainfall hyetographs, antecedent conditions, land use, and topography. Dry-weather flow and infiltration into the sewer system may be optionally generated using the Transport Block.

2)  The central core:

> The Transport and Extended Transport Blocks carry and
>
> combine the inputs through the sewer system.

3)  The correctional devices:

> The Storage/Treatment Block characterizes the effects of control devices upon flow and quality. Elementary cost computations are also made.

4)  The effect (receiving waters):

> The Receiving Block routes hydrographs and pollutographs through the receiving waters, which may consist of a stream, river, lake, estuary, or bay.
>
> Quality constituents for simulation may be arbitrarily chosen for any of the blocks, although the different blocks have different con­straints on the number and type of constituents that may be modeled. The Extended Transport Block is the only block that does not simulate water quality.

5 1-5

> <u>Service Blocks  
> Executive Block</u> --
>
> In addition to the five computational blocks mentioned above, two service blocks are utilized, the Executive and Combine Blocks. The Executive Block assigns logical units (disk/tape/drum), determines the block or sequence of blocks to be executed, and, on call, produces graphs of selected results on the line printer. All access to the computational blocks and transfers between them must pass through the MAIN program of the Executive Block. Transfers are accomplished on offline devices (disk/tape/drum) which may be saved for multiple trials or permanent record using appropriate job control language (JCL).
>
> <u>Combine Block</u> --
>
> This block allows the manipulation of data sets (files stored on offline devices) in order to, aggregate results of previous runs for input into subsequent blocks. In this manner large, complex drainage systems may be partitioned for simulation in smaller segments.
>
> <u>Statistics Block</u> --
>
> Output from continuous simulation can be enormous if results for every time step are printed. Even the monthly and annual summaries contain more information than may easily be assimilated. The Statistics Block has the capability to review the time step output from a continuous (or single event) simulation, separate output into discrete storm events, rank the events according to almost any desired criterion (e.g., peak or average runoff rate, pollutant load, etc.), assign empirical frequencies and return periods to runoff and pollutant parameters, tabulate and graph the results, and calculate statistical moments. Output from this block can thus be used to identify key events for further study and for many other screening and analytical purposes.
>
> <u>Total Simulation</u>
>
> In principle, the capability exists to run all blocks together in a given computer execution, although from a practical and sometimes neces­sary viewpoint (due to computer core limitations), typical runs usually involve only one or two computational blocks together with the Executive Block. This approach may be used to avoid overlay and, moreover, allow for examination of intermediate results before continuing the computa­tions. Further, it permits the use of intermediate results as start-up data in subsequent execution runs, thereby avoiding the waste of repeating the computations already performed.

3)  examples of the application of procedures described with sample I/O information reproduced.

> There are two exceptions. The user's manual and documentation for the Extended Transport Block has been prepared by Camp, Dresser and McKee (Roesner et al., 1981) as an addendum to this report and is avail­able as a separate document. Thus, Section 5 of this report merely introduces EXTRAN.
>
> Similarly, the Receiving Block is currently (May 1981) undergoing extensive revisions-at the EPA Athens, Georgia, Environmental Research Laboratory. This revised routine will combine the best features of the EPA Dynamic Estuary Model and its many derivatives, such as the Receiving Block. Hence, documentation from the Athens EPA effort will be utilized as a supplement to this report when available in the future, and Section 8 only outlines RECEIV capabilities.
>
> <u>Detailed SWMM Summary</u>
>
> A concise description of most features of SWMM is given in Table 1-
>
> 1, adapted from similar tables prepared by Huber and Heaney (1979, 1980). Except for the Receiving Block, an indication of almost all modeling techniques is included in the table.
>
> USER REQUIREMENTS  
> <u>Computer Facilities</u>
>
> A large, high-speed computer is required for operation of the SWMM, such as an IBM 370, Amdahl 470, UNIVAC 1108 or CDC 6600. The largest of the blocks requires on the order of 90,000 words of storage. Through considerable efforts, users have been able to adapt different blocks of the program to various mini-computers, but only with extensive use of off-line storage and increase in execution time. Execution time is discussed in SeCtion 2.
>
> <u>Data Requirements</u>
>
> As will be seen from a review of following sections, the data requirements for the SWMM may be extensive. Collection of the data from various municipal and other offices within a city is possible to accom­plish within a few days. However, reduction of the data for input to the model is time consuming and may take up to three man-weeks for a large area (e.g., greater than 2000 acres). On an optimistic note, however, most of the data reduction is straight forward (e.g., tabulation of slopes, lengths, diameters, etc., of the sewer system). The SWMM is flexible enough to allow different modeling approaches to the same area, and a specific, individual modeling decision upstream in the catchment will have little effect on the predicted results at the outfall.
>
> 3 1-8
>
> <u>Verification and Calibration</u>
>
> The SWMM is designed as a "deterministic" model, in that if all input parameters are accurate, the physics of the processes are simulated sufficiently well to produce accurate results with minimal calibration. This concept fails in practice because the input data and the numerical methods are not accurate enough for many real applications. Furthermore, many computational procedures within the model are based upon limited data themselves, especially surface quality predictions.
>
> As a result it is essential that local verification/calibration data be available at specific application sites to lend credibility to the predictions of any urban runoff model. These data are usually in the form of measured flows and concentrations at outfalls or combined sewer overflow locations. Note that quality measurements without accom­panying flows are of little value. The SWMM has sufficient parameters that may be "adjusted,"particularly in the Runoff Block, such that calibrating the model against measured data is usually readily accom­plished.
>
> METRIFICATION
>
> Use of metric units for input and output of data and results is now allowed in the Runoff, Transport and Storage/Treatment Blocks as an alternative to U.S. customary units. (Metric I/O to the Extran and Receive Blocks may be added in the future.) For the most part, the metric units are used strictly for I/O; all internal quantity calculations are still performed in ft-sec units. (These units will apply to program generated error messages printed during the simulation.) Most quality calculations use conventional concentration units (e.g., mg/1) and loads may be given in both pounds and kilograms, depending on the particular subroutine, although pounds<sub>3</sub>will not be used if metric I/O is specified. Thus, metric units (e.g., m /sec or, in some places, cms for brevity) are obtained merely by a conversion factor for printing.
>
> No attempt has been made to conform to SI standards or even customary metric units for some parameters. For instance, because of output format complications, metric pipe diameters are requested and printed in meters instead of the more usual millimeters. However, all units are clearly stated for both card input and printed output. It should be a simple task to convert to other metric alternatives.
>
> WHEN SHOULD SWMM BE USED?
>
> SWMM is a large, relatively sophisticated hydrologic, hydraulic and water quality simulation program. It is not appropriate for all applica­tions or for all manner of personnel. For instance, hydrologic routing (e.g., prediction of runoff from rainfall) may be performed simply using standard techniques (e.g., unit hydrographs, linear reservoirs) described in hydrology texts and suitable for programmable hand-held calculators (e.g., Croley, 1977) or micro-computers (e.g., Golding, 1981). In addition, many other, smaller Fortran programs are available for urban
>
> 9 1-9
>
> **hydrologic simulation that may be entirely suitable for a given problem and much easier to implement on a given computer system. Notable among the hundreds of such programs are the Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering Center program STORM (Roesner et al., 1974, HEC, 1977a) for continuous simulation and the Illinois State Water Survey program ILLUDAS (Terstreip and Stall, 1974) for single event simulation and pipe sizing. Both have good documentation and user support and have been extensively tested and utilized by engineers other than the model developers.**
>
> **SWMM has similar attributes but is certainly more formidable in terms of its size and capabilities. Who, then, should use SWMM and for what purposes? Some guidelines are given below for when SWMM probably is appropriate:**

1.  **The engineer is knowledgeable of the modeling techniques (e.g., non-linear reservoirs, kinematic waves, St. Venant equations, buildup-washoff equations). An appreciation for how physical processes may be simulated in a Fortran program is a necessity. As a corollary, the engineer is assumed to be familiar with the problem to be solved and with customary techniques for handling it. A clear problem definition is a prerequisite to any solution methodology.**

2.  **By virtue of its size (e.g., sewer system with hundreds of pipes) or complexity (e.g., hydraulic controls, backwater) a simpler technique or model will not work. It may be borne in mind, however, that SWMM may also be used as a very simple "black box" model with minimal input data, at the expense of computer overhead to manage the program size and off-line files.**

3.  **Quality is to be simulated. Although there are other models that also simulate quality, SWMM is perhaps the most flexible of any.**

4.  **A large body of literature on theory and case studies is**

> **desired. Since SWMM was originally introduced in 1971, a wealth of such information is available, including citation in hydrology texts (e.g., Viessman et al., 1977, Wanielista, 1978).**
>
> **The primary technical disadvantage of SWMM is its lack of routines for soil moisture accounting and sub-surface flow routing, e.g., as in HSPF (Johanson et al., 1980). It is thus seldom suitable for largely pervious, non-urban areas.**
>
> **While any number of other examples could be presented for when SWMM should not be used, attention is drawn to just one: the user is already familiar with an adequate alternative technique or model. It is far more important for the engineer/user to understand the methodology being utilized than it is for a model such as SWMM to be employed on the**
>
> **premise of a more sophisticated technique. In the final analysis, the engineer/analyst is responsible for the decisions made using any technique of analysis; the technique or model is only a tool that must be clearly understood by those using it.**

**SECTION 2**

**EXECUTIVE BLOCK, GRAPH ROUTINES AND  
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**

**BLOCK DESCRIPTION**

**<u>Functions</u>**

> **The Executive Block performs three functions:**

1)  **assignment of logical units and files,**

2)  **control of the sequencing of computational blocks, and**

3)  **graphing of data files by the line printer.**

**No computations as such are performed. The relationship of the Executive Block to other blocks is shown in Figure 2-1.**

**<u>Program Operation</u>**

**The Executive Block assigns logical units and files, and controls the computational block(s) to be executed. These functions depend on reading in a few data cards which must be supplied according to the needs of a given computer run.**

**Since the various blocks use logical devices for input and output of computations, the Executive Block has provision for assigning logical unit numbers by reading two data cards. Logical units and data sets are dis­cussed later. The first card may contain up to 20 integer numbers, corres­ponding to 10 input and 10 output units. It is not necessary, however, to make such a large number of assignment:; for the usual run; in fact, there have *been* few occasions during the development and testing of the model when more than four units have been needed. The files that are produced on these units are saved (during the run) for use by a subsequent computational block; also, the information contained in them can be examined directly by using the graphing capability of the Executive Block. The other unit assignments on the second data card are for scratch files, i.e., files that are gener­ated and used during execution of the program, and are erased at the end of the run. Again, there is provision for up to five such units, but only one or two are typically needed. The unit numbers are passed from the Executive Block to all pertinent blocks in the labeled COMMON/TAPES/.**

> **16 2-1**

The graphing subroutines enable hydrographs and pollutographs to be plotted on the line printer for selected locations for output data files (e.g., predicted results) as well as measured data that are input by the user. Predicted and measured results may be plotted on one graph for com­parison. Operation of the graph routines is described later. The subrou­tines include GRAPH, called from the main executive program only, in which control information, titles, and measured data, if any, are read.

Subroutine HYSTAT is called from GRAPH for computation of hydrograph volumes, durations, peak flows, and times of peaks. This is done for both predicted and measured hydrographs.

Subroutine CURVE is called from GRAPH to coordinate the actual plotting. It is also called diiectly from the Runoff, Extran and Receive blocks, in which case control information, titles, etc. are supplied from those blocks, bypassing subroutine GRAPH. Subroutine CURVE performs the following opera­tions:

1)  Determines maximum and minimum values of arrays to be plotted, calculates the range of values, and selects appropriate scale intervals using subroutine SCALE.

2)  Computes vertical axis labels based upon the cal­culated scales.

3)  Computes horizontal axis labels based upon the cal­culated scales.

4)  joins individual parts of the curve using subroutine PINE.

5)  Outputs final plot using subroutine PPLOT.

Subroutine SCALE calculates ranges and scaling factors. Subroutine PINE joins two coordinate locations with appropriate characters in the out­put image array A of PPLOT. Subroutine PPLOT initializes the plotting array, stores individual locations, and outputs the final image array A for the printer plot.

INTERFACING BETWEEN COMPUTATIONAL BLOCKS

Data may be transferred or interfaced from one block to another through the use of the tape/disk assignments on card group 'Al. The interface tape/ disk (file) header consists of descriptive titles, the user-supplied pollu­tant and unit names, the simulation starting date and time, the name of the block generating the interface file, the number of time steps and time step size, the total catchment or service area, and the number of locations (in­lets, outfalls, elements, etc.) and pollutants found on the interface file. Also included are the location identifiers for which flow and pollutant data are transferred, a conversion factor for converting the flow dimensions found

> 18 2-3

on the interface file to the internal SWMM dimension of cfs and the type of pollutant concentration units. Following the file header are the flow and pollutant data for each time step (up to the total number of time steps) for each of the specified locations. The detailed organization of the interfac­ing file is shown in Figure 2-2, and example Fortran statements that will write such a file are shown in Figure 2-3. These figures may be used as guidelines for users who may wish to write or read an interfacing file with a program of their own. Further information on required pollutant identifiers, etc. may be found in the Runoff Block card input data descrip­tion.

The title and the values for the starting date and time from the first computational block are not altered by any subsequent block encountered by the Executive Block. All other data may (depending on the block) be altered by subsequent blocks. The individual computational blocks also have limita­tions on what data they will accept from an upstream block and pass to a downstream block. These limitations are summarized in Table 2-1. Detailed discussions are presented in the computational block sections.

2.  other concentration units, e.g., JTU, pmho, °C, p11.

Conversion factor to obtain units of flow of cfs, (multiply values

on interface file by QCONV to get cfs).

Running time, beginning at TZERO, hours and fraction. First entry

on file is at TZERO DTSEC/3600. TIME is continuous and is not reset

at end of a day.

Date for this time step, six-digit number, year-month-day, e.g.,

Time of day for this time step, hours and fraction, e.g., 12:45A.M.

is 0.75.

Flow and pollutant loads for NLOCAT locations at this time step. Q(K) must be the <u>instantaneous</u> flow at this time (i.e., at end of time step) in units of length/time. POLL(j,K) is the flow rate times the concentration (instantaneous value at end of time step) fcic J'th pollutant at K'th location, e.g., units of cfa • mg/<sup>1</sup> o<sup>r</sup> misec •JT11<sup>c</sup>.

:Unformatted unless specified. Use an integer or real value as indicated by the variable name.

Elapsed time is thus TIME-TZERO.

<sup>c</sup>lf units other than cfs are used for flow, this will be accounted for by multiplication by parameter QCONV.

> The program has undergone detailed testing on the University of Florida Amdahl 470 V/6-II running under OS/MVS Release 3.7 JES2 NJE Release 3 (as of September 1979). Thus, SWHt1 should be compatible with any IBM or Amdahl machine. Experience has shown that the program may be run fairly easily on UNIVAC machines but can require minor programming changes for use on CDC equipment (see discussion of Fortran, below). In any event, users are regretfully warned that there are undoubtedly many "bugs" remaining in the program, subtle and otherwise, for which they must be on the alert.

<u>Sample Job Contl:ol Language (JCL)</u>

As a rule, JCL is highly machine dependent; in fact, it often differs on two identical machines at different installations. Therefore, the SWMM cannot include JCL that is universally applicable. The following remarks, however, may be useful in gaining insight into what is involved on systems such as an IBM 370/165 or Amdahl 470.

Usually, the interfacing file and scratch file assignments require JCL to *be* supplied for each unit. The rules for such JCL must be ascertained from the systems programmers at the installation, since there is consider­able variation in unit number availability, etc. In general, one should only set up the units needed in a given run, since there may be a charge for file space that is reserved, even if it is not used.

Most users will prefer to store a compiled version of SWMM on a disk rather than to compile and execute from cards or tape. Such an example is shown in Table 2-5. This example is for an IBM operating system such as is used on the University of Florida's Amdahl 470.

Note that the Extran Block uses the same graph subroutines as does the rest of SWMM. \].t is unnecessary to use a separate set of graph routines just for that block.

<u>Overlay Procedures</u>

The SWMM model was constructed as an overlay program because it can then be executed in an area of main storage that is not large enough to contain the entire model at one time. The linkage editor subdivides the model so that it can be loaded and executed segment by segment. The total main storage required is approximately 400 K bytes using the overlay structure illustrated in Table 2-5.

First, there is the root segment which is always in main storage and includes all the subroutines of the Executive Block.

Second, there is a group of subroutines on the same level, (ALPHA level), which is called a segment. Only one ALPHA segment can be in main storage at a time with the root segment (Executive Block).

Next, there is another group of subroutines on the next lower level, (BETA level). Only one BETA segment can occupy main storage simultaneously, with the ALPHA segment. Thence follow GAMMA and DELTA segments which behave similarly.

With the JCL and overlay setup as shown, all the SWMM blocks can be run either independently or sequentially in a continuous string. The Combine and Receive Blocks are the only blocks that cannot be run for this example. They could be run simply by removing the dummy subroutine cards at the beginning of the JCL and then by adding an OVERLAY ALPHA and INCLUDE LIB(COMBIN) card, etc. A systems programmer would be helpful in setting up the overlay on other machines. For instance, Wetzel and Johnson (1976) describe a segmented load procedure for CDC machines.

<u>Dummy Subroutines</u>

Use of dummy subroutines is not confined to the Combine and Receive Blocks. Rather, they may be used to wroid compiling or having in permanent storage any of the subroutines called by the SWNN Executive Block. These sub-programs are RUNOFF, TRANS (Transport), RECEIV (Receive), STRT (Storage/Treatment), COMBIN (Combine), EXTRAN (Extended Transport), STATS (Statistics) and GRAPH (graphing routine). The latter routine is always required and is part of the Executive Block. All others are needed only for specific applications and may be "dummied" in the manner of the Combine Block (as in Table 2-5), if not required.

29 2-14

<u>Scratch Data</u> Sei,s

A "scratch data set" is simply off-line storage (e.g., disk or drum) that is used during program execution. However, the contents are erased (lost) at the end of the simulation. These are established by assignment of logical units in lines 87-100 in Table 2-5 using IBM JCL, for example. Alternatively, it may be wished to save output from a block for future runs of subsequent. blocks. In this case, appropriate JCL must be provided tor this purpose.

Ordinarily, scratch data sets will'be used for parameters JIN, JOUT and NSCRAT of the Executive Block. With only two exceptions, parameters JIN and JOUT are used only to transfer data between blocks, as explained elsewhere within this section. One exception is that a JIN data set may be needed for rainfall input from a tape to the Runoff Block when continuous SWMM is being used. The second exception is that a ,BOUT data set must be used to store processed event data in the Statistics Block. (This data set cannot be transferred to other SWMM blocks.) The NSCRAT files are used for miscella­neous tasks within each block, most typically to store output for later printing. Currvnt requjremcnts are shown in Table 2-6.

The following presents a detailed explanation of the scratch data sets used for the parameters for the example of Table 2-5. These are used to make a typical run of the SWMM. The unit numbers assigned to the various data sets are arbitrary. Any desired values compatible with the descrip­tions of lines 87-100, Table 2-5, could be used. Furthermore, the following definitions assume Runoff, Transport, Storage/Treatment and Statistics are to he run in order. However, various f:equences may be used, and the param­eters would correspond to the sequence defined in lines 104-114 of Table 2-5. Line 101 tells the computer that input data follow. Line 102 is tape/disk assignments and corresponds to card group \*1 of the Executive Block Card Data Section. Line 102 may be interpreted as follows:

> JIN(1), JOUT(1), JIN(2), JOUT(2), JIN(3), JOUT(3), JIN(4), JOUT(4)
>
> 0 9 9 10 10 9 9 10

Here, JIN(N) = I refers to an input device or file and JOUT(N) = I refers to an output device or file. For example, a typical read statement in a FORTRAN program may be READ(I,80). The I is replaced by the symbolic unit number of an input device (e.g., card reader). As discussed previously, on most com-putei systems, I is equal to 5 for reading cards and 6 or 7 for writing or punching output. The same applies to JIN(N) = I or JOUT(N) = I where I is substituted with. the symbolic unit number of an input or output device such as a tape or disk unit, as defined by lines 87-100. Since the numbers 5, 6, and 7 have standard meanings, their descriptions are omitted.

> JIN(1) = unit number of tape/disk input into the first block to be run (Runoff Block). JIN(1) = 0 means there is no tape/disk input.

> INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATA PREPARATION  
> <u>Block Selection</u>
>
> The instructions for data preparation are divided into two parts cor­responding to control of the SWMM block selection and graphing capability. Figure 2-4 and Table 2-8 at the end of these instructions give the procedure for data card preparation.
>
> The program controls the computational block(s) to be executed by read-ingalphanumeric information, CNAME, on sentinel cards. Thus, for example, CNAME might be RUNOFF. The program compares this word with a dictionary of
>
> such words (first eight characters). a match is found, as it would be in  
> ti<sup>,</sup>is case, control is passed to the appropriate block. Here, for example, call would be made to the Runoff Block. After execution of the Runoff Block, control is returned to the Executive Block.
>
> The program again reads a sentinel data card, which might indicate that another block is to be executed. For example, if the Transport Block is to *be* executed, the control word TRANSPORT would be given, etc. If results are to be graphed, the control word GRAPH would be on the sentinel card, or, if the run is to be terminated, the word ENDPROGRAM is given on the card. A summary of the control words and corresponding action is given in Table 2-7.
>
> The use of control words.on sentinel cards allows considerable flexi­bility in utilization of the Storm Water Management Model. The most common type of run involves execution of one of the computational blocks along with the graphing of results on the line printer. Thus, for the Runoff Block, such a run would be made by appropriate use of the words RUNOFF, GRAPH, and ENDPROGRAM. If the entire model were to be run with graphical output at the end of, say for example, the Transport and Storage/Treatment Blocks, the sequence would be RUNOFF, TRANSPORT, GRAPH, STORAGE, GRAPH, and ENDPROGRAM.

> When called from the Executive Block, the graph routines will plot pre­dicted and/or measured hydrographs and pollutographs for specified locations. Such hydrographs and pollutographs will be called simply "graphs" in the following discussion. Predicted graphs can be generated by the Runoff, Transport, Extended Transport, and Stowage/Treatment blocks. Thus, their output files may be input to the graph routines. Measured graphs (or data otherwise input on cards by the user) may also be plotted whether or not predicted graphs are produced. Thus, the graph routines may be treated as stand-alone programs and used independently of the other SWHH blocks. When

**predicted and measured graphs are available for the same location, they will be overprinted on one plot for comparison purposes. This greatly facilitates calibration work.**

**A few simple statistics are also computed for each hydrograph and are printed below each plot: volume, peak, time of peak, and duration. When both the measured and predicted hydrographs are plotted on the same plot, the above statistics and differences (absolute and percent) are also given for the overlapping time period.**

**The final plot is produced by printing of array "A", dimensioned 51 (vertical) by 101 (horizontal). Both the vertical and horizontal scales are determined on the basis of the range of the input data. The left-most plot­ting location (at the left vertical axis) corresponds to the graph value at the start of the simulation (TZERO). When more than 100 points are to be plotted, the program selects points such that the final output will consist of up to 100 points. For instance, if 200 equally spaced (in time) data points were input, only every other one would be plotted. The actual choice of points plotted depends on the number read in, their range, and whether poinLs are "bunched" in some portion of the plot.**

**The particular graph routines used in SWMM "fill in" between separated points, horizontally or vertically, to form a continuous line. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly the points that were input for plotting, except that they are usually the end points of line segments.**

<u>Input Parameters and Options</u>

**Graphs (hydrographs** or pollutographs) may he \[dolled for only one **loca­tion at a time. Overprinting of graphs from several locations on just one plot is not allowed.**

**The routine will plot graphs of measured data, predicted data or both for a location. If measured and predicted graphs are both supplied for the same location, they will be overprinted on one plot for comparison.**

**Plots for up to ten locations for predicted and ten locations for mea­sured may be requested during one call' to GRAPH. The locations need not be the same. For example, the routine may be used to plot only predicted or only measured graphs. If there is a need to plot more than ten locations, GRAPH may simply be called again.**

**The routine will always plot hydrographs (when supplied) but will plot pollutographs only if NQP \> 0 (card Al). Any three from a group of up to ten pollutants may be plotted (card B1), assuming the pollutant is available. Any group of pollutants (as many as ten) may be input to GRAPH. The param­eter IPOL selects the IPOLth pollutant on the interfacing tape.**

**The time scales for input of measured graphs need not be the same as for predicted graphs, nor does the time spacing of measured graphs have to be constant. The plot will run from the minimum to the maximum times of the predicted or measured graphs. Several options are available for input of the times associated with graph ordinates (card D1).**

> **36 2-21**

**Input of tl.e horizontal axis Labe). is not required, and it always reads "Time of Day, in Hours". The times are actually elapsed time, beginning at the start of the simulation (TZERO). Conversion to hour of day does not include a reset at midnight. Thus, if a simulation period begins at, say, 10 p.m. and last.s four hours, the graph abscissa will run from 22 to 26 hours.**

**Vertical axis labels are either "flow in cts" or else the name and units of the pollutant being plotted. All pollutographs are plotted in concentration units. The same units are required for both predicted and measured pollutc'graph inputs. Hydrographs are plotted in units of cfs, (or m /sec if METRIC = 1) and measured data must be entered in these same units. "Loadographs" (e.g., lb/min vs. time) cannot be plotted.**

**The input format of all measured data may be supplied by the user (card E2). This should considerably facilitate the use of data already prepared under an arbitrary format. In addition; the number of data values per card may be varied (LCARD on card El).**

**Measured dz.ta may be read from cards (MEAS=1) or may be previously stored as card images on off-line file number MFILE and read from that file (MEAS=2 on card Al). Retrieval from file MFILE may avoid reading voluminous card data more than once. Of course, appropriate job control language must be supplied by the user to ensure the permanent storage of file MFILE.**

**Sample input data are shown** in conjunction with Runoff, Transport and Storage/Treatment runs.

**SECTION 3**

**COMBINE BLOCK**

**BLOCK DESCRIPTION**

**In order to add the capability of modeling larger areas, the Combine Block has been added to the Storm Watez Management Model. This block has two main objectives.**

**The first objective is to <u>collate</u> different data sets into one, e.g., two separate output data sets, one Transport and one Storage/Treatment, are to be input into the Receiving Water Block. The Coffibine Block would be used to collate the two output data sets into one which, in turn, would be input into the Receiving Water Block.**

**The second objective is to <u>combine</u> different data sets and nodes into a single data set and one node, e.g., using the Transport Block on two differ­ent drainage networks gives two separate output data sets. Both data sets go to** the same treatment facility **'at the same inlet node. This program would be used to combine the two different Transport output data sets into one data set with a single node which then could** be input **into the Storage/Treatment Block.**

**The Combine Block can be used in** a **number of different ways and gives the Storm Water Management Model the capability of simulating the largest and most diverse cities. For example, Figure 3-1 shows how the Combine Block was used on a combination of SWMI1 runs for Lancaster, Pennsylvania.**

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATA PREPARATION  
<u>Collate</u>**

**The first objective is to collate two different output data sets from Runoff, Transport, Storage/Treatment, Extran, or any combination thereof. This new data set could then be used a:; input into any block (Transport, Extran, Storage/Treatment or Receiving Water), except Runoff. For example (Figure 3-2), an output file from Transport area 'A' with manhole numbers 5, 6, 12 was collated with an output file from Transport area 'B' with manhole numbers 1, 3, 6. 19. Manhole number 6 is common between both output data sets, therefore the hydrographs and pollutographs from both manholes are added together. The new output file produced from the Combine Block has manhole numbers 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 19. This new data set could then** *be* **used as input to any other block, including Transport itself.**

> <u>Combine</u>
>
> The Combine section combines two different files and output locations into a single file with one output location. For example (Figure 3-3), an output file from Transport area 'X' with manhole number 16 and an output data set from Transport area 'Y' with manhole number 23 are to be used as input into the Receiving Water Block junction number 14. The Combine por­tion of the Combine Block would be used to combine the two output data sets into one data set with one location, assigned the new number, 14. This number would correspond to the junction number of the Receiving Water Block. The Combine Block card data are shown in Table 3-1.
>
> <u>Quality Options</u>
>
> The two different input files may have different quality constituents, especially if a Runoff file is combined/collated with a Transport file, etc. The user is responsible for knowing the contents of each input file and may specify on card Cl the constituents to be used from each. For instance, if BOD is the first constituent to be placed on the output file, and if it is ne<sup>5</sup>third on file 1 and seventh oil rile: 2, then NPOS2(1) = 3 and NPOS2(i) = 7. The description (name, units and type of units) will be copied from the first input file. Constituents not accessed will not be placed on the output file.
>
> If a constituent is contained on one file but not the other, it may still be used. However, the file for which the constituent position (NPOS1 or NPOS2) is zero will be assumed to have zero concentration for that con­stituent.
>
> If NPOLL = 0 on card Al no quality constituents will be placed on the new output file regardless of whether they are on the input files.
>
> <u>Timing</u>
>
> Both input files must utilize the same time step. An error message will be printed if they differ. If the starting time (TZERO) is different for the two input files, the output file will begin at the earlier TZERO
>
> using zeroes for the other file until series begins. Similarly, if one  
> input file ends before the other, zeroes will be used until the end of the other file.
>
> <u>Files</u>
>
> The two off-line files (unit numbers) used as input are specified by parameters NDATAS(1) and NDATAS(2), and the output file by parameter NDOUT. Note that Executive Block parameters JIN and JOUT are not used at all by the Combine Block. Nor does the Combine Block advance the "counter" for param­eters JIN and JOUT as all other blocks do. For instance, if the following sequence were performed: 1. Runoff-A, 2. Runoff-B, 3. Combine (Runoff-A and Runoff-B), 4. Transport, then JIN(3) and J0UT(3) would refer to the Transport Block run and not to the Combine Block run.

SECTION 4  
RUNOFF BLOCK

BLOCK DESCRIPTION  
<u>Introduction</u>

The Runoff Block has been developed to simulate both the quantity and quality runoff phenomena of a drainage basin and the routing of flows and contaminants to the major *sewer* lines. It represents the basin by an aggre­gate of idealized subcatchments and gutters. The program accepts an arbi­trary rainfall or snowfall hyeiograph and makes a step by step accounting ot snowmelt, infiltration losses in pervious areas, surface detention, overland flow, gutter flow, and the constituents washed into inlets leading to the calculation of a number of inlet hydrographs and pollutographs.

The Runoff Block may be run in the single event or continuous mode. With the slight exception of snowmelt, all computations are done identically for the two cases. In addition, continuous SWMM produces extra daily,

monthly and animal summary output which single event SWMM does not. The main difference between single event and continuous operation is basically that the latter uses data sets (off-line storage) for storage of precipitation and temperature input data instead of dimensioned arrays, thus eliminating any restriction on the number of time steps. Even in the single event mode, the only time step limitation is imposed by the allowed input of only 200 precipi­tation and air temperature values. Since the input time intervals for precip­itation and air temperatures do not have to equal the computational time step, this may impose a limit for single event simulation of either greater or less than 200 time steps. (The limi.t of 200 precipitation values may be bypassed by setting file NSCRAT(4) \# 0.)

The overall catchment may be divided into a maximum of 200 subcatchments for single event simulation and 30 for continuous simulation although such high limits are only rarely needed. These, in turn, may drain into a maximum of 200 (or 30) €;utter/pipes plus inlets. Inlet flows and pollutographs may be placed on the interfacing file for input to subsequent blocks. However, these blocks have their own limitations on the number of inflow locations they will accept.. See Table 2-1 for details.

This section describes the program operation of the Runoff Block, pro­vides instructions on data preparation and input data card formats, shows sample runs, and presents the results of a calibration of the Runoff Block.

<u>Program Operation</u>

The relationships among the subroutines which make up the Runoff Block are shown in Figure 4-1. Subroutine RUNOFF is called by the Executive Block to gain entrance to the Runoff Block. The program prints "ENTRY MADE TO RUNOFF MODEL" and then acts as the driver routine for the block. Subroutine RUNOFF directly calls subroutines HYDRO and PRINTR. Although BLOCK DATA is not actually a subroutine, it is automatically activated by RUNOFF and initializes some variables. Subroutine PRINTR reads tape headers, and prints the table headings and results of the quantity and quality simula­tions.

Subroutine HYDRO computes the hydrograph ordinates and the watershed quality contributions with the assistance of six core subroutines, i.e., RHYDRO, QHYDRO, WSHED, QSHED, BUILD and GUTTER. It initializes all vari­ables to zero before calling RHYDRO to read in the rainfall hyetograph and information concerning the inlet drainage basin. Subroutine CTRAIN is called from RHYDRO if the continuous simulation mode is selected. Its purpose is to read long-term precipitation/temperature histories from Na-ti.onal Weather Service (NWS) magnetic tapes. TE quality is to he simolatcd, subroutine QHYDRO is called for input of parameters and subroutine ERROR prints its error messages. QSHED and BUILD are then called to initialize the watershed constituent loads. Next HYDRO sets up an ordering array to sequence the computational order for gutter/pipes according to the upstream and downstream relationships.

HYDRO then sets up a DO loop to compute the hydrograph ordinate for each incremental time step. In each step, subroutine WSHED is first called to calculate the rate of water flowing out of the idealized subcatchments. If snowmelt is simulated subroutines AREAL and MELT are called from WSHED and subroutine FINDSC from AREAL. Additionally, subroutine CAMP is called from WSHED if the Green-Ampt model is used to simulate infiltration. If quality is to he simulated, QSHED and BUILD are called to compute the water­shed quality contributions from catchbasins, erosion, dust and dirt, and other sources. GUTTER is then called to compute the instantaneous water depth and flow rate for the gutter/pipes and to route the flow. Water flowing into the inlet point, be it from gutter/pipes or direct drainage from subcatchments, is summed for a hydrograph ordinate. A continuity check is then made for the disposition of rainfall water in the form of runoff, detention, and infiltration and evaporation losses. The error in continuity is computed and printed as a percentage of precipitation. With the assist­ance of subroutine HCURVE, HYDRO plots the rainfall hyetograph and the runoff hydrograph for the total drainage basin. Subroutine GQUAL routes quality in each gutter/pipe for the flow values computed in subroutine GUTTER.

<u>Interfacing and the Use of Off-line Computer Storage</u>

The Runoff Block transfers hydrographs and pollutographs for as many as 200 inlets and 10 constituents through an assigned tape or disk to other SWMM blocks (see Section 2). However, the other blocks may only accept part of this output. These restrictions may be circumvented by making a single

run of the Runoff Block and generating a permanent data set that will allow several runs of other blocks utilizing different portions of the output. If this is the first computational block, the title, and values for the start­ing date and time and time step size will remain throughout all subsequent blocks.

One or two scratch data set are required for the single-event mode and as many as three scratch data sets are required for the continuous mode; see Table 4-1. In the continuous mode the additional data sets are used to provide the program with a continuous feed of precipitation data so that there is effectively no limit on the length of the simulation.

Table 4-1 Runoff Data Set Allocations

JIN(1)<sup>a</sup> = Input unit for NWS precipitation tape, read only, required for continuous SWMM only (ICFAIN = 1 or 4 only, card Bl).

NSCRAT(1) = ScrPtch data set, always required. Used for temporary storage of output data to be printed.

NSCRAT(2)<sup>b</sup> = Data set used for storage of processed precipitation val­ues (and temperatures if snowmelt is used) for continuous SWM4, ICRAIN \# 0. File can be saved and used as input for subsequent Runoff runs if desired, (TCRAIN = 2), thus avoid­ing reprocessing of precipitation (and temperature) records. Can also be used to contain precipitation data for single event SWMM (lCRA1N=0) thus avoiding time step restrictions.

NSCRAT(3)<sup>b</sup> = Input data set for NWS temperature tape, read only, re­quired only for continuous SWMN with snowmelt, ICRAIN = 1 or 4 and ISNOW = 2.

NSCRAT(4) = Temporary storage of precipitation input data; may be used to avoid possible limit of 200 time steps with single event SWMM.

JOUT(1)<sup>a</sup> = Output unit for transfer of Runoff results to subsequent blocks. Not required if no subsequent blocks are used or graphing is not desired.

Subscript "one" is used if Runoff is the first block run in a SW/111 simula­tion. See explanation of Executive Block (Section 2).

<sup>b</sup>Although files. NSCRAT(2) and NSCRAT(3) are protected for an individual run

taken

during continuous SWMM using Runoff and Storage/Treatment, care should be

during subsequent SWMM runs to insure that other blocks using scratch files do not accidently access the same files and write over them, thus eliminat­ing them.

> <u>Basic Runoff Data Sources</u>
>
> <u>Importance of Runoff Block Data</u> --
>
> The Runoff Block forms the source of runoff and quality hydrographs and pollutographs for most SWMM applications. Although the other SWMM blocks allow direct input of hvdrographs and pollutographs from cards, eithor bypassing the interfacing file or in addition to it, in most cases these will be generated by the conversion of rainfall/snowmelt into runoff and pollutant loads in the Runoff Block. Hence, the input data for this block are probably the most important in the model.
>
> Key data requirements and sources are mentioned during discussions of individual card groups later. However, the general types of data are dis­cussed briefly at this point.
>
> <u>Meteorological</u> Data --
>
> Precipitation data are usually obtained from on-site gages maintained by an agency that has performed rainfall-runoff monitoring such as a local consulting firm, 208 agency, or city, county, state or federal agency. In the unfortunate event of a missing rain gage, precipitation data are then obtained from the nearest National Weather Service (NWS) station. The fundamental data are precipitation hyet.ographs for the duration of the simulation. (See subsequent discussion for use of synthetic rainfall data When znowmelt is simulated, air temperatures and wind speed are needed in addition.
>
> <u>Surface Quantity Data</u> --
>
> Flow routing data are usually derived from topographic maps, aerial photos and drainage system plans. These are customarily obtained from the local agency responsible for drainage, usually the city or county. Especi­ally for topographic maps, there is great variation in the quality of such data. Some cities, for instance, have 1:200 scale topographic maps complete with outlines of roads and structures. Slopes are easily derived from the one or two foot contours found on such maps. In other cities, the only contour information available may be the 1:24000 scale USGS quadrangle maps from which gross parameter estimation is often the only possibility. Seekers

of basic quantity data must be prepared to spend one to five days at the municipal engineer's office to locate needed maps, plans etc. in public files.

A significant problem remains: the reliability of such data sources. Most municipal offices contain design drainage drawings, but recent as-built information is very rare. In older cities, design drawings may date back several decades and only serve as a guide to what actually exists in the field. This most often affects sewer slopes and cross sections (due to deterioration of old sewers). Finally, combined sewer regulators and other hydraulic control locations are often different from design drawings because of deterioration and maintenance. In many instances, hydraulic connections exist that are not included on any plans because of pragamatic action of maintenance crews. .In summary, all such data should be field checked.

<u>Surface Quality Data</u> --

Data required to formulate pollutographs are the most conceptual and ambiguous of any SWMM input data. Such data and their possible sources are discussed later. At this point it is only re-emphasized that unless act“al field sampling of runoff quality has been performed, typically by a 208 o;: pollution control agency, the credibility of predicted quality result:; cannot be established.

<u>Default Parameters</u>

A characteristic of past SWMM versions has been the inclusion of de­fault values for many quantity and quality parameters. Although this prac-Lite is continued in a few instances, it is now discouraged, either by removal of a default option altogether, or else by forcing the user to insert the default parameters. This latter option is easily accomplished through the use of "default" and "ratio" cards -- see footnotes 23 and 24 to Table 4-28. Thus, the user is encouraged at least to consider the values of Manning's n, depression storage or infiltration parameters, for instance. Representative values and guidelines for selection of such parameters are included in this volume.

<u>General Input and Control Data (Card Groups Al - B2)</u>

The first three card groups are concerned with a label for the output and general operating parameters. The labels of card Al will be placed ott the interfacing file for future identification of the output. Most in­dividual parameters are self-explanatory. However, further information ott several parameters (e.g., infiltration) may be found in subsequent discus­sions of those topics. The computational time step, DELT, is discussed in conjunction with rainfall data and flow routing (surface quantity) param­eters. Also, the user should avoid printing large amounts of unnecessary output and use the parameters IRPRNT, ICNTNS, and IPRDAY judiciously (es­pecially for continuous simulations).

**<u>Meteorological Data Processing (Card Groups CI-F1)  
Snowmelt Data</u> --**

**<u>General Parameters</u> -- Card groups Cl through Fl are used•to read all per­tinent meteorological data. Within these cards, groups CI-05 are concerned with snowmelt, if simulated. Additional snowmelt parameters are found in card groups 11-13. Since snowmelt procedures are discussed in detail for those card groups and in Appendix II, only minimal information is given here.**

**On card Cl, the watershed elevation is used only to compute average atmospheric pressure, which in turn has only a minimal effect on results. Hence, it is not a "sensitive" parameter. The free water holding capacity of a snow pack is the volume of water (as a depth, in inches) within the pack that can be held as liquid melt prior to releasing runoff. In the model it simply acts as an intermediate reservoir.; the larger its volume, the greater the delay in the appearance of runoff following the conversion of snow to liquid water. Unfortunately, as is the case for most snowmelt parameters, very few data exist that permit estimation of this parameter in urban areas, let alone make distinctions among three types of snow covered areas as required on card Cl. However, some available information is sum­marized in Table 4-2.**

**In natural areas, a surface temperature (SNOTMP) of 34 to 35<sup>°</sup>F (1-2<sup>°</sup>C) provides the dividing line between equal probabilities of rain and snow<sub>.</sub> (Eagleson, 1970, Corps at Engineers, 1956). However, parameter. SNOTMP on card Cl** might need to he somewhat lower in urban areas due to warmer surface temperatures.

**The snow gage correction factor accounts for the error in snow gage measurements. The value of SCF is usually greater than 1.0 (the gage tends to underestimate the catch) and increases as a function of wind speed. Representative values are shown in Figure 4-2 (Anderson, 1973). In prac­tice, SCF can be used as a calibration factor to account for gains or losses of snow if data are available to determine it.**

**During non-melt periods (i.e., sub-freezing weather) the temperature of the snow pack follows the air temperature, but with a delay, since tempera­ture changes cannot occur instantaneously. Heat exchange and temperature changes during this period are explained in Appendix II with reference to equations II-15 and II-16. The weighting factor, TIPH, is an indicator of the thickness of the "surface" layer of the snow pack. Values of TIPH \< 0.l give significant weight to temperatures over the past week or more and would indicate a deeper layer (thus inhibiting heat transfer) than TIPM values greater than about 0.5 which would essentially only give weight to tempera­tures during the past day. In other words the pack will both warm and cool faster (i.e., track the air temperatures) with higher values of TIPH. Anderson (1973) states that TIPM = 0.5 has given reasonable results in natural catchments, although there is some reason to believe that lower values may be appropriate. No data exist for urban areas.**

> Heat transfer within the snow pack is less during non-melt periods than during melt periods due to the preset.ce of liquid water in the pack for the latter case. Parameter RNM simply multiplies melt coefficients (described for card groups 11-I3) to produce a lower "negative melt coefficient" for use during non-melt periods. A typical value for natural areas is 0.6, with values for urban areas likely to be somewhat higher because of the higher density of urban packs. The higher the value of RNM, the more rapid is the heat gain or loss of the pack in response to air LemperaLore chduges.

These max-min temperatures are on the NWS card deck 345, "WBAN Summary of Day", as shown in Figure 4-3. A magnetic tape containing these card images is available for most first-order NWS stations and others within the U.S. from the NOAA National Weather Records Center in Asheville, NC (phone

704, 258 2850). A record of 25 years costs <u>approximately</u> \$100. Such a record, corresponding to the precipitation record, is required for continuous simulation of snowmelt. Values are interpolated for missing dates. Parameter LOCAT3 is seen to be located in columns 1-5 of card deck 345 (Figure 4-3).

<u>(find Data</u> -- Wind speeds, entered on card C2, are used only for melt cal-cultionc during periods,of rainfall (<sup>,</sup>-q-^"^n 11-8). The higher the val­ues of wind speed, the greater are the convective and condensation melt terms. Of course, if-the simulation covers a large city, the wind speeds entered on card C2 can only be considered gross estimates of actual high­ly variable speeds. Average monthly speeds are often available from cli­matological summaries (e.g., NOAA, 1974).

<u>Areal Depletion Curves</u> -- Areal depletion curves account for the variation in actual snow covered area that occurs following a snowfall. They are explained in detail in Appendix II, some of which is repeated herein.

In most snowmelt models, it is assumed that there is a depth, SI, above which there will always be 100 percent cover. (Values of Si are input in card group I2.) In some models, the value of SI is adjusted during the simulation; in SWMM it remains constant. The amount of snow present at any time is indicated by the parameter WSNOW, which is the depth (water equivalent) over the snow covered areas of each subcatchment. This depth is r,cu-dimensionalized by S\[ for use in calculating the frac­tion of areas that is snow covered, ASC. Thus, an areal depletion curve (ADC) is a plot of WSNOW/Si versus ASC; a typical ADC for a natural catch­ment is shown in Figure 4-4. For values of the ratio AWESI = WSNOW/SI greater than 1.0, ASC = 1.0, that is, the area is 100 percent snow covered.

Some of the implications of different functional forms of the ADC may be seen in Figure 4-5. Since the program maintains snow quantities, WSNOW, as the depth over the total area, AT, then the actual snow depth, WS, and area covered, AS, are related by continuity,

Equation 4-2 can be used to compute the actual snow depth, WS, from known ADC parameters, if desired. It is unnecessary to do this in the program, but it is helpful in understanding the curves of Figure 4-5. Thus,

Consider the three ADC curves, B, C and D. For case B, AWE\$I is always less than ASC; hence, WS is always less than SI as shown in Figure 4-5d. For case C, AWESI = ASC, hence WS = SI, as shown in Figure 4-5e. Finally, for case D, AWESI is always greater than ASC; hence WS is always greater than SI, as shown in Figure 4-5f. Constant values of ASC at 100 percent cover and 40 percent cover are illustrated in Figures 4-5c, curve A, and Figure 4-5g, case E, respectively. At a given time (e.g, t**<sub>1</sub>** in Figure 4- 5), the area of each snow depth-area curve is the same and equal to AWESI

- SI, (e.g., 0.3 SI for time t<sub>1</sub>).

Curve B on Figure 4-5a is the most common type of ADC occurring in nature, as shown in Figure 4-4. The convex curve D requires some mech­anism for raising snow levels above their original depth, SI. In nature, drifting might provide such a mechanism; in urban areas, plowing and windrowing could cause a similar effect. It is seen that such a convex curve acts to delay melt because of the inhibiting effect on heat trans­fer of deep snow packs. A complex curve could be generated to represent specific snow removal practices in a city. However, the program utilizes only one ADC curve for all impervious areas and only one ADC curve for all pervious areas. This limitation should not hinder an adequate simula­tion since the effects of variations in individual areas are averaged out in the city-wide scope of most continuous simulations.

The two ADC curves for impervious (card C3) and pervious (card C4) areas are input by the user, as are values of SI for each subcatchment (card I2). The program does not require the ADC curves to pass through the origin, AWESI=ASC=0; they may intersect the abscissa at a value of ASC \> 0 when ASC = 0.

The preceding paragraphs have centered on the situation where a depth of snow greater than or equal to SI has fallen and is melting. (The ADC curves are not employed until WSNOW becomes less than SI.) The situation when there is new snow is discussed in Appendix II.

<u>Air Temperatures</u> --

For single event snowmelt simulation, air temperatures are input in card group C5. These may be obtained from instrumentation at the catch­ment or from the nearest NWS station. The temperatures are constant over the time interval DTAIR (card B2). Hence, DTAIR should be an integer multi­ple of DELT.

<u>FrecipilaLion</u> Data --

**<u>Choice of Rainfall Data</u> -- Without doubt, rainfall data are the single most important group of hydrologic data required** by SW1111. Yet, they are often prepared as an afterthought without proper consideration of the implications of their choice. The following discussion will briefly des­cribe options for rainfall input and their consequences. Only rainfall is considered since for snow it is the physics of snoumelt rather th?n. snowfall which is important in determining runoff.

SWMM requires a hyetograph of rai.afall intensities versus time for the period of simulation. For single event simulation this is usually a single storm, and data for up to six gages may be entered (if the user is fortunate enough to-have multiple gages for the catchment). For continu­ous simulation, hourly data from only one gage are required; these are usually obtained from the nearest NWS station. Thus, for continuous simu­lation, the options are fewer since a satisfactory generator of a synthet­ic hourly rainfall sequence is not usually available, or probably even desir­able. Hence, a historical rainfall sequence is used.

For single event simulation, on the other hand, synthetic sequences are indeed an option in lieu of historical records. However, several pit­falls exist in the use of synthetic hyetographs that may not be obvious at first thought. As a prelude, consider the objectives of hydrologic quan­tity and quality modeling.

<u>Modeling Objectives</u> -- These were treated broadly in Section 1. More spe­cifically, models might be used to aid in urban drainage design for protec­tion against flooding for a certain return period (e.g., five or ten years), or to protect against pollution of receiving waters at a certain frequency (e.g., only one combined sewer overflow per year). In these contexts, the frequency or return period needs to be associated with a very specific pa­rameter. That is, for rainfall one may speak of frequency distributions of interevent times, total storm depth, total storm duration or average storm intensity, all of which are different (Eagleson, 1970, pp. 183-190). Traditional urban drainage techniques often utilize frequencies of depths given durations, taken from intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, which are really conditional frequency distributions. But for the above objectives, and in fact, for almost all urban hydrology work, the frequen-cieS-of runoff and quality parameters are required, not those of rainfall at all. Thus, one may speak of the frequencies of maximum flow rate, to­tal runoff volume or duration or of total pollutant loads. These distri­butions are in no way the same as for similar rainfall parameters, although they may be related through analytical methods (Howard, 1976, Chan and Bras, 1979, Hydroscience, 1980). Finally, for pollution control, the real inter­est may lie in the frequency of water quality standards violations in the receiving water, which leads to further complications.

Ideally an analyst would develop costs and benefits for designs at several frequencies in preparation **for an economic optimization. In** prac­tice, it is often difficult to accomplish this for even one case.

65 4-15

> However, continuous simulation offers an excellent, if not the only method for obtaining the frequency of events of interest, be they related to quantity or quality. Advantages are discussed in Section 1 and Appen­dix I along with several other models besides SWMM that will perform simi­lar tasks. But continuous simulation has the disadvantages of a higher cost and the need for a continuous rainfall record. This has led to the use of a "design storm" or "design rainfall" or "design event" in a single event simulation instead of continuous. Of course, this idea long preceded continuous simulation, before the advent of modern computers. It is the choice of the design event, as it will be termed herein, that may lead to problems.
>
> <u>Design Events</u> -- Two methods of obtaining design events are considered:
>
> 1\) use of a historical sequence and 2) generation of a synthetic sequence. Synthetic sequences are usually constructed by the following steps:
>
> 1\. A storm duration is chosen, either on an arbitrary basis or to coincide with the assumed catchment time of concentration, t, i.e., equi­librium time during a steady rainfall at which outflow equals<sup>c</sup> a constant fraction of inflow (or outflow equals inflow on a catchment without lnsges). The latter method itself has difficulties because of the depen­dence of t on rainfall intensity and other parameters (Eagelson, 1970).
>
> <sup>c</sup> 2. A return period is chosen in order to select the total storm depth for the specified duration from intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves.

3.  A time history for the storm is assumed, usually on the basis of historical percentage mass curves. if peak intensities are at the begin­ning of the storm, the hyetograph takes on the appearance of a decaying exponential curve. If the peak intensities are near the middle, a "circus tent" hyetograph results (Figure 4-6). The hyetograph is shaped such that depths (or average intensities) for any duration centered about the peak match those from the IDF curve.

4.  The continuous hyetograph of Figure 4-6 must then be segmented in­to a histogram for input to most digital models.

> This procedure was apparently first detailed by Keifer and Chiu (1957) and then by Tholin and Keifer (1960) in Chicago. It has since been emu­lated by many others.
>
> Many problems with this procedure have been enumerated for construc­tion of synthetic hyetographs (McPherson, 1978, Patry and McPherson, 1979) and the underlying Rational Method and IDF curves on which it is based (McPherson, 1969). These reports may be seen for details, but some key points are given here:

1.  IDF curves themselves may consist of components of several differ­ent storms. They in no way represent the time history of a real storm.

2.  When frequencies are assigned to total storm depths (independent of duration) they generally do not coincide with the conditional frequen­cies of depth given duration obtained from IDF curves. For instance, the two historical storms shown on Figure 4-6 for comparison with the "5-year" synthetic storm of 2.28 in (58 mm) have return periods (based on total depth) of 4.6 and 5.8 years, but total depths of only 1.61 and 1.85 in (41 and 47 mm), respectively. Thus, IDF curves cannot be used to assign

66 4-16

<img src="./media/image20.png" style="width:0.85625in;height:0.75347in" />

frequencies to t:torm volumes. If synthetic hyetographs are thence used for studies of detention storage or pollutant loads, where volumetric considera­tions are key, no frequency should be assigned to the results.

0.  Although the time history assigned to a synthetic storm may repre­sent an average of many storms, there is often considerable variability (see P. Bock, Discussion of Tholin and Keifer, 1960). If a frequency could be assigned to a synthetic storm, it would probably be considerably rarer than its nominal frequency, because the joint probability of all time sequences within the storm corresponding to those of an IDF curve is very low. The two historical storms shown on Figure 4-6 certainly do not mimic the synthet­ic storm.

1.  Antecedent conditions must still be chosen arbitrarily when using a design event (either a synthetic or historical storm).

2.  A synthetic design event is one that "never really happened." McPherson (1978) emphasizes the need to design with a real (historical) event to insure credibility in the eyes of the public.

3.  There is evidence that synthetic design events may produce an over-design if the objective is a design for a given return period. Marsalek (1978a,b) has compared continuous simulation results of flood peaks and volumes vcrcus return period with results obtained by single event simula­tions using the same model with input of n-year synthetic events of the type described earlier. Flood peaks are always higher for the synthetic events. Flood volumes are higher for most synthetic events, depending on the method of generation of the event, because the return periods assigned to the synthetic volumes are incorrect.

<u>Design Event Alternatives</u> -- In spite of all of its problems, use of a design event may still he required. Fortunately, there are ways in which this may *be* accomplished satisfactorily.

Foremost among these is the use of continuous simulation as a screening tool. As stated earlier, continuous simulation for several years of a large catchment with inclusion of spatial detail can be expensive. Instead, representative smaller catchmehts may be simulated from which critical events may be selected for a more detailed, single event simulation. Thus, from a simple long-term continuous simulation, critical subsets may be iden­tified for further analysis. Walesh and Snyder (1979) present ideas along this line.

Continuous simulation may also be used to "calibrate" a synthetic de­sign event. That is, the design hyetograph may be adjusted such that it produces flows or volumes that correspond for its return period to those produced by a continuous simulation run. This has been done in studies in northern Virginia (Shubinski and Fitch. 1976) and Denver (B. Urbonas, per­sonal communication, 1979). Proper adjustment of antecedent conditions can also cause results from synthetic design events to match historical results (Wenzel and Voorhees, 1978).

In any event, several storm events should be processed for design considerations. These may be selected from a continuous simulation run, as suggested above or chosen from the historical record on another basis. For urban drainage or flood control design, it may be desirable to choose a

> <u>Card Input of Precipitation Data</u> -- For single event.simulation, precipita­tion hyetographs may be input for up to six gages in card groups El and E2. Any one of the six gages may then be assigned to a subcatchment. The time interval for input of hyetograph intensities, THISTO, (the same for all hyetographs) must be either equal to the computation time step, DELT (Card B2), or an integer multiple or integer fraction (e.g., 1/2, 1/5, etc.) thereof. If TH1STO is an integer fraction of DELT, the average intensity over time step DELT is used in computations.

> <u>Spatial Rainfall Variations</u> -- Even for small catchments, runoff and con­sequent model predictions (and prototype measurements) may be very sensitive to spatial variations of the rainfall. For instance, thunderstorms (convec-tive_rainfall) may be very localized, and nearby gages may have very dissimi­lar readings. For modeling accuracy (or even more specifically, for a successful calibration of SWMM), it is essential that rain gages be located within and adjacent to the catchment.
>
> SWMM inputs the spatial variability by the assignment of one of up to six gages to a particular subcatchment. (Clearly, there is no point in the input of more gage data than there are subcatchments.) If multiple gages are available, this is a much better procedure than is the use of spatially averaged (e.g., Thiessen weighted) data, because averaged data tend to have short-term time variations removed (i.e., rainfall pulses are "lowered" and "spread out"). In general, if the rainfall is uniform spatially, as might be expected from cyclonic (e.g., frontal) systems, these spatial considera­tions are not as important. In making this judgment, the storm size and speed in relation to the total catchment must be considered. It should be noted that a moving or "kinematic" storm may only be simulated in SWMM by using multiple gages. Storm motion may very significantly affect hydrographs at the catchment outlet (Yen and Chow, 1968, Surkan, 1974, James and Drake, 1980).
>
> <u>Evaporation Data (Card F1)</u> --
>
> An average monthly evaporation rate is required for the month being simulated in the single event mode, or for all months in the continuous mode. This rate is subtracted from rainfall and snowmelt intensities at each time step and is also used to replenish surface depression storage but for no other purposes. For instance, it is not used to account for sublima­tion from snow or exfiltration from soil. Evaporation data may usually be obtained from climatological summmaries (NOAA, 1974) or NWS or other pan measurements (e.g., from NWS <u>Climatological Data).</u> Single event simulations are usually insensitive to the evaporation rate, but evaporation can make up a significant component of the water budget during continuous simulation.

> **Card groups G1 through I3 input data used to establish flow routing and snowmelt parameters for the Runoff Block. Snowmelt will be discussed subse­quently. Flow routing is accomplished using three types of elements:**

1.  **subcatehment elements (overland flow),**

2.  **gutter elements (trapezoidal channel flow), and**

3.  **pipe elements (circular channel flow).**

> **Subcatchment elements receive rainfall and snowmelt, account for losses due to evaporation and infiltration (via Horton's equation or the Green-Ampt equation), and permit surface depression storage to. account for losses such as ponding or retention on grass or pavement. Flow from subcatchments is always into gutter/pipe elements or inlets. A tree-network of gutter/ pipes may be used to simulate smaller drainage elements of the sewer system. If they are used, they route hydrographs (and pollutographs) from subcatchments to inlets (e.g., entry points to the main sewer system). Inlet flows are placed on the interfacing file for transmital to subsequent. SWMM blocks. However, the Runoff Block is often used by itself if the more sophisticated routing procedures of the Transport or Extended Transport Blocks are not required (discussed below).**
>
> **Flow routing for both subcatchments and gutter/pipes is accomplished by approximating them as non-linear reservoirs. This is simply a coupling of a spatially lumped continuity equation with Manning's equation. A detailed description is presented in Appendix VI and the SWMM Final Report (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). Should the capacity of a gutter/pipe be exceeded, "surcharge" is indicated, and excess water is stored at the upstream end until the gutter/pipe can accept it.**
>
> **<u>Input Data Preparation</u> --**
>
> **Preparation of these input data cards requires two tasks: 1) dis-cretization of the physical drainage system and 2) estimation of the co­efficients necessary to characterize the catchment. These tasks require varying amounts of effort depending on the level of detail desired by the user.**
>
> **Very useful additional information for these tasks is contained in short course proceedings prepared by the University of Massachusetts (Di-Giano et al., 1977). The Runoff Block example is particularly good because of the emphasis on data reduction from typical municipal maps and plans. The SWMM user** is **encouraged to review these proceedings for alternative explanations and examples. Further useful information is contained in the User's Manual prepared for Canadian SWAM applications (Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren, 1977) and in the SWMM-related references discussed in Section 1.**

> <u>Discretization</u> .'f <u>the Catchment</u> --
>
> <u>Definition</u> -- Discretization is a procedure for the mathematical abstraction of the physical drainage system. For the computation of hydrographs, the drainage basin may be conceptually represented by a network of hydraulic elements, i.e., subcatchments, gutters, and pipes. Hydraulic properties of each element are then characterized by various parameters, such as size, slope, and roughness coefficient.
>
> Subcatchments represent idealized runoff areas with uniform slope. Parameters such as roughness values, depression storage and infiltration values are taken as constant for the area and usually represent averages, although pervious and impervious areas have different characteristics within the model. If roofs drain onto pervious areas, such as lawns, they are usually considered part of the pervious area, although conceivably, they could be treated as miniature subcatchments themselves.
>
> Discretization begins with the identification of drainage boundaries using a topographic map, the location of major sewer inlets using a sewer system map, and the selection of those gutter/pipes to be included in the Runoff Block system. Note that discretization of the sewer system involves choices that affect elements to be used in either of the subsequent Trans­port Blocks (see below). An example will illustrate some of these points.
>
> <u>Example</u> -- Two possible discretizations of the Northwood catchment in Balti­more (Tucker, 1968, Huber et al., 1979) are indicated in Figures 4-8 and 4-9 (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). A "fine" approach was used in Figure 4-8, resulting in 12 subcatchments and 13 pipes leading to one inlet. In Figure 4-9, a "coarse" discretization was used, resulting in five subcatchments and no gutter/pipes. "Storm Conduits" shown in Figure 4-9 could either be simulated by the Transport Block or ignored, feeding all subcatchment flows to the one inlet. The outlet to the creek then represents the downstream point in the simulation. (This could lead; in a larger system, to inlets in the Transport Model.)
>
> A comparison of hydrographs produced by the two methods is shown in Figure 4-10 (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a), in which the differences are relatively minor. Additional calibration effort could bring the two schema-tizations into better agreement with each other and with the measured hydro-graph. Techniques for this purpose are discussed later as are techniques for aggregation of subcatchments.
>
> <u>Required Amount of Detail</u> -- It is anticipated that only a very coarse discretization will be used for continuous simulation. Although up to 30 subcatchments and gutter/pipes or inlets are allowed, a typical continuous simulation might include only one subcatchment and no gutter/pipes. This economy in the amount of detail simulated is prompted to save computer time and because detail simply is not required for continuous simulation which serves as a screening and planning tool (see Section 1 and Appendix I). Moreover, reasonable agreement is possible between hydrographs produced by coarse and fine schematizations as will be discussed later under "subcatch-ment aggregation".

**Should flow routing be desired during continuous simulation, Runoff Block gutter/pipes may be used. (The Transport Blocks are intended pri­marily for a detailed storm event analysis.)**

**For single event simulation, the amount of detail should be the minimum consistent with requirements for within-catchment information. Obviously, no information can be obtained about upstream surcharging if the upstream conduits are not simulated and subcatchments are not provided to feed them. In addition, sufficient detail needs to be provided to allow within-system control options to be tried for different areas and land uses. If, however, the primary objective is simply to produce a hydrograph and pollutograph at the outlet, utilizing a single rain gage, then one subcatchment will often (but not always) serve as well as many.**

**A final constraint on the amount of detail is dictated by personnel requirements for data reduction. Once data resources (e.g., maps, plans) are gathered, discretization of the catchment can occupy one to three per­son-days (a longer time for more subcatchments) with perhaps an additional 15 to 30 minutes per subcatchment for their input parameters. Finally, there is no one "right" way to accomplish tF1P discretization,**

**especially since decisions at this stage can be compensated for during the later calibration phase.**

<u>**Choice of** *Sewer* **System Flow Routing**</u> **-- There are many criteria that influence the choice of the block used for sewer system routing: Runoff, Transport or Extended Transport. Several of these are give in Table 4-3; much more extensive information is contained in the sections of this report and SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, Roesner et al., 1981) pertain­ing to each block.**

**Regarding flow routing methods, no backwater effects can be calculated (i.e., in an upstream direction) in the Runoff and Transport Blocks because each conduit element simply provides an inflow to a downstream element with no effect of the latter on the former. Thus, both Runoff and Transport Block routing acts as a "cascade" of elements, each discharging into the next with no other interactions. On the other hand, the solution of the complete St. Venant (gradually varied flow) equations by the Extended Trans­port Block provides for backwater effects and much more, as indicated in Table 4-3. This is at the cost of considerable extra complexity and com­puter time.**

**As a practical matter, the Runoff Block is often used to simulate smaller diameter pipes, e.g., less than 30 in (762 mm) and one of the two Transport Blocks for the larger trunk sewer system. The larger the catch­ment being simulated, the less important becomes the simulation of small conduits, far upstream. Conduits of less than a 12 in (305 mm) diameter are rarely simulated. Also, in spite of the fact that Runoff Block trapezoidal conduits are called "gutters", it should almost never be necessary to simu­late flow in a roadside curb and gutter channel, unless the catchment is extremely small.**

> **<u>Numbering Schenw.<sup>,</sup>s</u> Subcatchments may be assigned any numbers between 1 and 9999. This is true also for gutter/pipes and inlets except that inlet numbers corresponding to Transport Block manholes must be less than or equal to 1000. Also, Receive Block junctions have a maximum number equal to the number of junctions. Thus, inflows to such junctions must be numbered accordingly. To be on the safe side, it is often a good idea to reserve relatively low numbers for inlets, etc. that are transfered to subsequent blocks.**
>
> **Internally, the Runoff Block assigns subscripts (internal numbers) in the order in which the gutter/pipes or subcatchment cards are read in. Some error messages use these numbers. It is not necessary to state specifically the inlets to be transfered to subsequent blocks, since all inlets at the downstream end of any subcatchment-gutter/pipe flow routing chain are placed in that category and are printed out.**
>
> **Within the above confines, considerable latitude exists for numbering schemes. Thus, subcatchments may feed gutter/pipes with the same number; subcatchments or gutter/pipes may be given numbers in a certain range (e.g 200 - 299) based on certain characteri3tics; etc. The Transport Block numbering scheme allows even more latitude since it includes non-conduits (e.g., manholes).**

>
> **<u>Routing and Time Step Considerations</u> -•- As mentioned earlier, the non-linear reservoir method of** gutter/pipe flow routing is described in Appendix V and the original documentation volume (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). Since the formulation produces a spatially "lumped" configuration (i.e., there is no dependence upon longitudinal distance for a given gutter/pipe element), flows introduced at the "upstream end" of such an element are distributed horizontally over the entire water suface area. The implication is that a concentrated inflow into one "end" of a simulated gutter/pipe is a reason­able approximation to the true situation in which gutter/pipes receive distributed inflows along their lengths.
>
> At each time step, an iterative (llewton-Raphson) scheme is used to solve the non-linear difference equation used to approximate the differ­ential equation of the non-linear reservoir. Depending upon the choice of parameters for the gutter/pipe and the size of the time step, DELT, conver­gence problems can arise. These usually occur with a gutter/pipe of rela­tively small volume (e.g., short length and diameter) coupled with too long a time step. In such a case, the continuity equation may try to force a negative volume to be calculated because there is not enough "real water" in the gutter/pipe to satisfy the outflow rate. In such a case, the volume and outflow are set to zero and a warning message is printed by subroutine **GUTTER.** This correction only approximates the true occurrence and results in a small error in continuity.
>
> Most convergence problems of this or other natures can be cured either by decreasing the time step or increasing the gutter/pipe dimensions.
>
> **79 4-29**

Analysis of a similar finite difference approximation for a <u>linear</u> reservoir routing technique indicates that negative volumes cannot occur if

> DELT \<

<u>2 • <sub>Q</sub></u> — <u>V</u> 2 <u>• <sub>V</sub>GLEN</u>

> (4-4)

where DELT = computational time step, sec,

> V = volume of water in gutter/pipe, f'<sup>3</sup>,
>
> Q = outflow from gutter/pipe, cfs,
>
> GLEN = length of gutter/pipe, ft, and
>
> V = velocity of flow through gutter/pipe, ft/sec.

The requirement of equation 4-4 is thus a <u>suggestion</u> for Runoff Block gut-ter/pipe routing, since a stability analysis of the non-linear routing scheme has not been accomplished. Note, however, that if gutter/pipes are used for continuous simulation, with a one-hour time step, their dimensions should be quite large.

As a general rule, accuracy of the scheme increases as the time step decreases, hut it should seldom be necessary to decrease the time step to less than one minute; most often DELT is between one and five minutes. The choice of the time step is also linked to the rainfall hyetograph input, discussed earlier.

<u>Parameter Selection</u> -- Most gutter/pipe parameters are self explanatory and little interpretation is needed. The slope and roughness are combined into one parameter for further use in the program, using Manning's equation. Thus,

where GCON = routing parameter,

Thus, equivalent changes in the routing can be made through changes in either the slope or roughness.

The invert slope is usually given on drainage maps or may easily be calculated from invert elevations and conduit lengths. Tables of Manning's roughness coefficients are given in many references; see for instance Chow (1959) or ASCE-WPCF (1969).

<u>Subcatchment Parameters (Card Groups H1 and H2)</u> --

<u>Subcatchment Schematization</u> -- Many hydrologic models obtain a distributed effect (spatially) by subdividing the overall catchment into subcatchments, predicting runoff from the subcatchments on the basis of their individual properties, and combining their outflows using a flow routing scheme. This

> 80 4-30

procedure is followed in SWMM, in which subcatchments are idealized mathe­matically as spatially lumped, non-linear reservoirs, and their outflows are routed via the gutter/pipe (or a subsequent Transport Block) network.

Each subcatchment is schematized as in Figure 4-11, in which three or four subareas (depending on whether snowmelt is simulated) are used to represent different surface properties as enumerated in Table 4-4. The slcpe of the idealized subcatchment is in the direction perpendicular to the width. Flow from each subarea moves <u>directly</u> to a gutter/pipe or inlet and does not pass over any other subarea. (Thus, it is not possible to route runoff from roofs over lawn surfaces, for instance.) The width of the pervious subarea, A2, is the entire subcatchment width, whereas the widths of the impervious subareas, Al, A3, A4, are in proportion to the ratio of their area to the total impervious area, as implied in Figure 4-11. Speci­fication of each subarea is through the use of parameters WAREA and WW(3) on Card H1, PCTZER on Card B2 and.SNN1 on Card Il. If desired, any sub-catchment may consist entirely of any one (or more) types of subareas.

Of course, real subcatchments seldom exhibit the uniform rectangular geometries shown in Figure 4-11. In terms of the flow routing, all geometrical properties are merely parameters (as explained below) and no inherent "shape" can be assumed in the non-linear reservoir technique. However, in terms of parameter selection, the conceptual geometry of Figure 4-11 is useful because it aids in explaining the flow routing.

<u>Routing and Time Step Considerations</u> -- The routing and time step discussion given earlier for gutter/pipes applies almost identically for subcatchments. A detailed explanation of the non-line.3r reservoir equations is also

given in Appendix V. The routing is performed separately for each of

> the three or four subareas of the subcatchment. The same comments apply regarding convergence and time step considerations as given with reference to equation 4-4, except that V and Q are the volume and outflow of water, respectively, from each subarea within the subcatchment. In fact, convergence problems are rarely encountered during subcatchment routing because total subcatchment volumes (area times depth) are usually large compared to outflow volumes.

> <u>Subcatchment Width</u> -- If overland flow is visualized (Figure 4-11) as running downslope off an idealized, rectangular catchment, then the width of the subcatchment (card HI) is the physical width of overland flow. This may be further seen in Figure 4-13 in which the lateral flow per unit width, q<sub>L</sub>, is computed and multiplied by the width to obtain the total inflow into the gutter. (As mentioned previously, the SWHH gutter/pipes can only receive a concentrated inflow, however, and do not receive a distributed inflow in a specific fashion.) Note also, in

step of 5 mil:. Clearly, as the subcatchment width is narrowed (i.e., the outlet is constricted), the time to equilibrium increases. Thus, it is achieved quite rapidly for cases A and B and more slowly for cases C, D and E. The kinematic wave computation of t<sub>c</sub> (Figure 4-14) is not partic­ularly accurate for the non-linear reservoirs in which the asymptotic value of equilibrium outflow is approached exponentially. However, it may be used for guidance.

> Two routing effects may be observed. A <u>storage effect</u> is very

noticeable, especially when comparing hydrographs A and E for a duration of 20 min. The subcatchment thus behaves in the familiar manner of a reservoir. For case E, the outflow is constricted (narrow); hence, for the same amount of inflow (rainfall) more water is stored and less released. For case A, on the other hand, water is released rapidly and little is stored. Thus case A has both the fastest rising and recession limbs of the hydrographs.

A <u>shape effect</u> is also evident. Theoretically, all the hydrographs peak simultaneously (at the cessation of rainfall). However, a large width (e.g., case A) will cause equilibrium outflow to be achieved rapidly, producing a flat-topped hydrograph for the remainder of the (constant) rainfall. Thus, for a catchment schematized with several subcatchments and subject to variable rainfall, increasing the widths can tend to cause peak flows to occur sooner. In general, however, shifting hydrograph peaks in time is difficult to achieve through adjust­ment of Runoff Block flow routing parameters. The time distribution of runoff is far and away the most sensitive to the time distribution of rainfall. Further discussion of the effect of subcatchment width on hydrograph shapes will be given below under "Subcatchment Aggregation and Lumping".

What is the best estimate of subcatchment width? If the subcatchment has the appearance of Figure 4-13, then the width is approximately twice the length of the main drainage channel through the catchment. This is perhaps the best single approximation. However, if the drainage channel is on the side of the catchment as in Figure 4-14, the width is just equal to the length of the channel.

Most real subcatchments will be irregular in shape and have a drainage channel which is off center, as in Figure 4-16. A simple way of handling this case is given by the University of Massachusetts Proce­edings (DiGiano et al., 1977). A skew factor is computed,

> To reiterate, changing *the* subcatchment width changes the routing parameter WCON of equation 4-6. Thus, identical effects to those discus­sed above may be created by appropriate variation of the roughness and slope.
>
> <u>Subcatchment Area</u> -- In principle, the catchment and subcatchment area can be defined by constructing drainage divides on topographic maps. In practice, this may or may not be easy because of the lack of detailed contour information and the presence of unknown inflows and outflows. This may be most noticeably brought to the modeler's attention when the measured runoff volume exceeds the measured rainfall volume. Since the latter depends upon the catchment area, the area may be at fault.
>
> From the modeling standpoint, there are no upper or lower bounds on subcatchment area (other than to avoid convergence problems, as discussed earlier). Subcatchments are usually chosen to coincide with different land uses and with drainage divides. Further guidance is given later while discussing subcatchment aggregation.
>
> <u>Imperviousness</u> -- The percent imperviousness of a subcatchment is another parameter that can, in principle, be measured accurately from aerial photos or land use maps. In practice, such work tends to be tedious, and it is common to make careful measurements for only a few representa­tive areas and extrapolate to the rest.
>
> Care must be taken to insure that impervous areas are hydraulically (directly) connected to the drainage system. For instance, if rooftops drain onto adjacent pervious areas, they should not be treated as

> impervious in the Runoff Block. On the other hand, if a driveway drains to a street and thence to a stormwater inlet, the driveway would be considered to be hydraulically connected. Rooftops with downspouts connected directly to a sewer are definitely hydraulically connnected.
>
> Should rooftops be treated as "pervious", the real surrounding pervious area is subject to more incoming water than rainfall alone and thus might produce runoff sooner than if rainfall alone were considered. In the unlikely event that this effect is important (a judgment based on infiltration parameters) it could be modeled by altering the infiltration parameters or by treating such pervious areas as separate subcatchments, and increasing their rainfall by the ratio of roof area plus pervious to pervious alone. Since the roof areas would then not be simulated, continuity would be maintained.
>
> Further information on the concept of hydraulically connected impervious areas is contained in USGS studies (Jennings and Doyle, 1978) and documentation of the 1LLUUAS model (Ierstriep and Stall, 19/4).

>
> For continuous simulation in which very large subcatchments are being used, even spot calculations of imperviousness may be impractical. Instead, regression formulations have been developed in several studies (Graham et al., 1974, Stankowski, 1974, Manning et al., 1977, Sullivan et al., 1978). These typically relate percent imperviousness to population density, and are compared in Figure 4-17 (Heaney et al., 1977). The New jersey equation (Stankowski, 1974) is perhaps the most representative,

> <u>Slope</u> -- The subcatchment slope should reflect the average along the pathway of overland flow to inlet locations. For a simple geometry (e.g., Figures 4-13 and 4-14) the calculation is simply the elevation difference divided by the length of flow. For more complex geometries, several overland flow pathways may be determined, their slopes calculated, and a weighed slope computed using a path-length weighted average. Such a procedure is described in the University of Massachusetts Proceedings (DiGiano et al., 1977, pp. 101-102).

<u>Depression Storage</u> -- Depression (retention) storage is a volume that must be filled prior to the occurrence of runoff on both pervious and impervious areas (see Figure 4-12); a good discussion is presented by Viessman et al. (1977). It represents a loss or "initial abstraction" caused by such phenomena as surface ponding, surface wetting, intercep­tion and evaporation. In some models, "depression storage" also includes infiltration in pervious areas. In<sup>.</sup>the Runoff Block, water stored as depression storage on pervious areas is subject to infiltration (and evaporation), so that it is continuously and rapidly replenished. Water stored in depression storage on impervious areas is depleted only by evaporation. Hence, replenishment typically takes much longer.

As described earlier (e.g., Table 4-3), a percent PCTZER (card B2) of the impervious area is assigned zero depression storage in order to promote immediate runoff This percentage is the same for all subcatch-ments. Should variation among subcatchments be desired, PCTZER may be set to zero, and zero values for WSTORE entered in card group H1 as needed.

Depression storage may be derived from rainfall runoff data for impervious areas by plotting runoff volume (depth) as the ordinate against rainfalL volume as the abscissa for several storms. The rainfall intercept at zero runoff is the depression storage. Data obtained in this manner from 18 urban European catchments (Falk and Niemczynomicz, 1978, Kidd, 1978a, Van den Berg, 1978) are summarized in Table 4-6. The very small catchments (e.g., less than 1 ac or 0.40 ha) were primarily roadway tributaries to stormwater inlets and catchbasins.

> Viessman et al. (1977, p. 69) illustrate a similar but linear plot in which depression storage values for "four small impervious areas" range from 0.06 to 0.11 in (1.5 to 2.8 mm), considerably higher than the values shown in Figure 4-18. The reason for this discrepancy is not known, but it appears that the recent European data may be better suited to provide depression storage estimates, mainly because of their extent.
>
> Separate values of depression storage for pervious and impervious areas are required for input in card group Hl. Representative values for the latter can probably be obtained from the European data just discussed. Pervious area measurements are lacking; most reported values are derived from successful simulation of measured runoff hydrographs. Although pervious area values are expected to exceed those for impervious areas, it must b' remembered that the infiltration loss, often included as an initial abstraction in simpler models, is computed explicitly in SWMM. Hence, pervious area depression storage might best be represented as an interception loss, based on the type of surface vegetation. Many interception estimates are available for natural and agricultural areas (Viessman et al., 1977, Linsley et al., 1949). For grassed urban surfaces a value of 0.10 in (2.5 mm) may be appropriate.
>
> As mentioned earlier, several studies have determined depression storage values in order to achieve successful modeling results. For instance, Hicks (1944) in Los Angeles used values of 0.20, 0.15 and 0.10 in (5.1, 3.8, 2.5 mm) for sand, loam and clay soils, respectively, in the urban area. Tholin and Kiefer (1960) used values of 0.25 and 0.0625 in (6.4 and 1.6 mm) for pervious and impervious areas, respectively, for their Chicago hydrograph method. Miller and Viessman (1972) give an initial abstraction (depression storage) of between 0.10 and 0.15 in (2.5 and 3.8 mm) for four composite urban catchments.

> In SWMM, depression storage may be treated as a calibration parameter, particularly to adjust runoff volumes. If so, extensive preliminary work to obtain an accurate <u>a priori</u> value may be point­less since the value will be changed during calibration anyway.

> Required parameters for card group HI are f<sub>o</sub> (WLMAX), f<sub>m</sub> (MLMIN) and *a* (DECAY). In addition a parameter used to regenerate infiltration capacity (REGEN, card B2) is required for continuous simulation. Although the Horton infiltration equation is probably the best-known of the several infiltration equations available, there is little to help the user select values of parameters f and a for a particular application, (fortunately, some guid­ance can be 'Lund for the value of f). Since the actual values of f<sub>o</sub> and a (and often f<sub>m</sub>) depend on the soil, vegetation, and initial moisture content, ideally these parameters should be estimated using results from field infil-trometer tests for a number of sites of the watershed and for a number of antecedent wetness conditions. If it is not possible to use field data to find estimates of f , f<sub>m</sub>, and a for each sub-catchment, the following guide­lines should be helpful.

> Alternatively, values for f<sub>m</sub> according to Musgrave (1955) are given in Table 4-7. To help select a value within the range given for each soil group, the user should consider the texture of the layer of least hydraulic conductivity in the profile. Depending on whether that layer is sand, loam, or clay, the f value should be chosen near the top, middle, and bottom of the range respectively. For example, the data sheet for Conestoga-silt loam identifies it as being in Hydrology Group B which puts the estimate of f<sub>a</sub>, into the range 0.15-0.30 in/hr, (3.8-7.6 mm/hr). Examination of the texture of the layers in the soil profile indicates that they are silty in nature, suggesting that the estimate of

> For any field infiltration test the rate of decrease (or "decay") of infiltration capacity, a, from the initial value, f, depends on the initial moisture content. Thus the a value determined for the same soil will vary from test to test.
>
> It is postulated here that, if f is always specified in relation to a particular soil moisture condition (e.g., dry) and for moisture contents other than this the time scale is changed accordingly (i.e., time "zero" is adjusted to correspond with the constant f<sub>o</sub>), then a can be considered a constant for the soil independent of initial moisture content. Put another way, this means that infiltration curves for the same soil, but different antecedent conditions, can be made coincident if they are moved along the time axis. Butler (1957) makes a similar assumption.

> The initial infiltration capacity, f<sub>o</sub>, depends primarily on soil type, initial moisture content, and surface vegetation conditions. For example, Linsley et al. (1975) present data which show, for a sandy loam soil, a 60 to 70 percent reduction in the f value due to wet initial conditions. They also show that lower f values apply for a loam soil than for a sandy loam soil. As to the effect of vegetation, Jens and McPherson (1964, pp. 20.20 - 20.38) list data which show that dense grass vegetation nearly doubles the infiltration capacities measured for bare soil surfaces.

In the absence of better knowledge of a<sub>d</sub>, it is taken to be a constant fraction or multiple of a,

> a<sub>d</sub> = R a (4-17)

where R = constant ratio, probably \<\< 1.0, (implying a "longer" drying curve than wetting curve). The parameter R is represented in the program by REGEN (card B2).

On well drained porous soils (e.g., medium to coarse sands), recovery of infiltration capacity is quite rapid and could well be complete in a couple of days. For heavier soils, the recovery rate is likely to be slower, say 7 to 14 days. The choice of the value can also be related to the interval between a heavy storm and wilting of vegetation. The value of a<sub>d</sub> is then,

> a<sub>d</sub> = 0.02/D (4-1A)
>
> 103 4-53

**where a<sub>d</sub> =** Ra = **recovery curve decay coefficient, day<sup>-1</sup>, and**

**D = number of days required for the soil to dry out (recover).**

**The factor of 0.02 in equation_6-H assumes 98 percent recovery of**

**infiltration capacity (i.e., e = 0.98). The value of R mfy then be**

**calculated from equation 4-17. For example, for a = 4.14 daN and dry4ng times of 3,\_Z and 14 days, values of R are 1.61 x 10 , 6.90 x**

**10 and 3.45 x 10 respectively.**

**<u>Green-Ampt Infiltration</u> -- The second infiltration option is the Green-Ampt equation (1911), which, although not as well known as the Horton equation, has the advantage of physically based parameters which, in principle, can *be* predicted <u>a priori.</u> The Mein-Larson (1973) formulation of the Green-Ampt equation is a two-stage model. The first step predicts the volume of water, F , which will infiltrate before the surface becomes saturated. From this point onward, infiltration capacity, f , is pre­dicted directly by the Green-Ampt equation. Thus,**

Like the Horton equation, the Green-Ampt infiltration equation has three parameters to be specified S (SUCT), K<sub>s</sub> (HYDCON) and IMD (SMDMAX). Again, estimates based on any avadable field data should take precedence over the following guidelines. No default values are provided.

The "Soil Survey Interpretation" sheet (see Figure 4-19) available for most soils from the SCS shows values of "permeability" (hydraulic conductivity) for the soil, K . However these values are taken from data for disturbed samples an8 tend to be highly variable. For example, for Conestoga silt loam the values range from 0.63 to 2.0 in/hr (16 to 51 mm/hr). A better guide for the K values is as given for parameter f for the Horton equation; theoretically these parameters (i.e., f<sub>o</sub>, and K ) should be equal for the same soil. Note that, in general, the range of K values encountered will be of the order of a few tenths of an inch per dour.

The moisture deficit, IMD, is defined as the fraction difference between soil porosity and actual moisture content. Sandy soils tend to have lower porosities than clay soils, but drain to lower moisture contents between storms because the water is not held so strongly in the soil pores. Consequently, values of IMD for dry antecedent conditions tend to be higher for sandy soils than for clay soils. This parameter is the most sensitive of the three parameters for estimates of runoff from pervious areas (Brakensiek and Onstad, 1977); hence, some care should be taken in determining the best IMD value to use. Table 4-10, derived from Clapp and Hornberger (1973), gives typical values of IMD for various soil types.

> Table 4-10 Typical Values of IMD (SMDMAX) for Various Soil Types
>
> Soil Typical IMD at
>
> <u>Texture</u> <u>Soil Wilting Point</u>
>
> Sand 0.34

> Sandy Loam 0.33

> Silt Loam 0.32
>
> Loam 0.31
>
> Sandy Clay Loam 0.26
>
> Clay Loam 0.24
>
> Clay 0.21

These IMD values would be suitable for input to <u>continuous</u> SWMM; the soil type selected should correspond to the surface layer for the parti­cular subcatchment. For <u>single event</u> SWMM the values of Table 4-10 would apply only to very dry antecedent conditions. For moist or wet antecedent conditions lower values of IMD should *be* used. When estimating the particular value it should be borne in mind that sandy soils drain more quickly than clayey soils, i.e., for the same time since the previous event, the IMD value for a sandy soil will be closer in value to that of Table 4-10 than it would be for a clayey soil.

**The average capillary suction, S, is perhaps the most difficult parameter to measure. It can be derived from soil moisture - conductivity data (Mein and Larsen, 1973) but such data are rare for most soils. Chu (1978) gives average values of the product of S<sub>u</sub>.IMD for a range of soils, but these are not based on measurements. Fortunately the results obtained are not highly sensitive to the estimate of S (Brakensiek and Onstad, 1977). The approximate values which follow result from a survey of the literature (Mein** and Larsen, 1973, **Brakensiek and Onslad, 1977, Clapp and Horuberger, 1978, Chu, 1978). Published values vary considerably and conflict; however, a range of 2 to 15 in (50 to 380 mm) covers virtually all soil textures. Table 4-11 summarizes the published values.**

**It is very difficult to give satisfactory estimates of infiltration equation parameters that will apply to all soils encountered. Whichever infiltration equation is used, the user should be prepared to adjust preliminary estimates in the light of any available data whether they be infiltrometer tests, measurements of runoff volume, or local experience.**

**<u>Subcatchment Agvegation and Lumping</u> --**

**As discussed earlier, it is desirable to represent the total catch­ment by as few subcatchments as possible, consistent with the need for hydraulic detail within the catchment. That is, if the only interest is in hydrographs and pollutographs at the catchment outlet, as is likely for continuous simulation, then one subcatchment should suffice for the simulation (although up to 30 can be used for continuous simulation). For a single event, detailed simulation, the number of subcatchments needed is a function of the amount of hydraulic detail (e.g., backwater, surcharging, routing, storage) that must be modeled. In addition, enough detail must be simulated to allow non-point source controls to be evaluated (e.g., detention, street sweeping). Finally, multiple subcatch-ments are the only means by which a moving (kinematic) storm may be simulated. Coupled spatial and temporal variations in rainfall can signi­ficantly alter predicted hydrographs (Yen and Chow, 1968, Surkan, 1974, James and Drake, 1980).**

**106 4-56**

**Clearly, the required volume of input data (and personnel time) decreases as the number of subcatchments decreases. How then, can sub-catchments be aggregated or "lumped" to provide hydrographs and polluto-graphs that are equivalent to more detailed simulations?**

**The most complete study of this question is contained in the Canadian SWMN report (Proctor and Redfern and J. F. MacLaren, 1976a) in which the effect of lumping is** compared on real and hypothetical catchments. **Similar work has been performed independently by Smith (1975). In both studies it is shown that a single equivalent lumped catchment can be formulated by proper adjustment of the subcatchment width.**

**In SWMM, Runoff and Transport simulation of the drainage network (i.e., conduits and channels) adds storage to the system and thus attenuates and somewhat delays the hydrograph peaks. When the drainage network is removed from the simulation, subcatchment runoff feeds "instantaneously" into-inlets, with consequent higher and earlier hydrograph peaks. The key to aggregation of subcatchments is thus the replacement of the lost storage. This is best acccomplished through variation of the subcatchment width, although the** samc **effect could be achieved through variation of the slope or roughness (see discussion of equation 4-6). However, it is assumed that reasonable average values of the latter two parameters for the total catchment may be obtained by weighting individual subcatchment values by their respective areas. (For the roughness an area-weighted harmonic mean may be used, although it is probably an unnecessary refinement). Hence, the subcatchment width is a more logical parameter to be adjusted.**

**It was shown in the discussion of the subcatchment width, that reducing its value increases storage on the subcatchment. Hence, as subcatchments are aggregated and drainage network storage lost, the total catchment width, i.e., the sum of the subcatchment widths, must be reduced accordingly. This may *be* seen in Figure 4-20 for a very schema­tized drainage network in which the subcatchment widths are nominally twice the length of the drainage conduits (Smith, 1975). The lumped catchment could be represented by a single subcatchment, as in the bottom sketch of Figure 4-20, in which the width is approximately twice the length of the main drainage channel. Experience indicates (Smith, 1975, Proctor and Redfern and J. F. MacLaren, 1976a) that good results can be obtained with no channel/conduit network. However, the Canadian study (Proctor and Redfern and J. F. MacLaren, 1976a) does illustrate the routing effect of an "equivalent pipe" in the Transport Block. Note that if the storm duration is long compared to the catchment time of concentration, and if the rainfall intensity is constant, the peak flows obtained for either a. lumped or detailed simulation will be about the same, since equilibrium outflow must ultimately result (see the discussion of Figure 4-15).**

**Several examples of lumping using real rainfall data on real catch­ments are shown by Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren (1976a) and Smith (1975). An instructive example for the 2330 ac (943 ha) West Toronto**

> area is taken from the former reference and shown in Figure 4-21. A Runoff-Transport simulation using 45 subcatchments and including the drainage network is compared with three Runoff-only simulations with no drainage network. The best agreement, in terms of matching of peak flows, between the detailed and lumped simulations occured for a single subcatchment width of 60,000 ft (18,000 m) which is about 1.7 times the length of the main trunk conduit in the actual system. Even if a factor of two had been used (i.e., a width of 70,600 fL or 21,500 m) as a first guess, agreement would not ***be*** bad. The timing of the peaks for the single subcatchment representation is somewhat early, but adequate for most purposes. Recall that it is difficult to change the timing of subcatchment hydrograph peaks by changing only the width.
>
> It is assumed that when subcatchments are aggregated, other para­meters required on card HI are simply areally weighted. When this is done, very little difference in runoff volume occurs between the aggre­gated and detailed representations. Differences that do result are usu­ally—from water that remains in storage and has not yet drained off of the lumped catchment, or from very slightly increased infiltration on the limped catchment, again due to the longer presence of standing water on pervious areas (because of the reduced width).
>
> To summarize, many subcatchments may be aggregated into a single lumped or equivalent subcatchment by using areally weighted subcatchment parameters and by adjustment of the subcatchment width. The lumped subcatchment width should be approximately twice the length of the main drainage channel (e.g., the trunk sewer) through the catchment in order to match hydrograph peaks. The effect on runoff volume should be minimal.
>
> Runoff quality predictions are affected by aggreagtion of sub-catchments to the extent that hydrographs and surface loadings are changed. When areal weighted averages of the latter are used for a lumped catchment, total storm loads are essentially the same as for a detailed simulation. Pollutographs of concentration versus time then vary only because of hydrograph variations.

> <u>Overview of Procedures</u> -- Following the earlier work of the Canadian SWMM study by Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren (1976a, 1976b, 1977) snowmelt simulation has been added for both single event and continuous simulation. Since snowmelt computations are explained in

Anderson's temperature-index and heat balance melt equations are used for melt computations during dry and rainy periods, respectively. For continuous simulation, the "cold content" of the pack is maintained in order to "ripen" the snow before melting. Routing of melt water through the snow pack is performed as a simple reservoir routing procedure, as in the Canadian study.**
>
> **The presence of a snow pack is assumed to have no effect on overland flow processes beneath it. Melt is routed in the same manner as rain­fall.**
>
> **<u>Subcatchment Schematization</u> -- When snowmelt is simulated, a fourth subarea is added to each subcatchment as illustrated in Figure 4-11. The properties of each subarea are described in Table 4-4. The main purpose of the fourth subarea is to permit part of the impervious area (subarea A4) to be continuously snow covered (e.g., due to windrowing or dumping) and part (subareas Al plus A3) to be "normally bare" (e.g., streets and sidewalks that are plowed). However, during continuous simulation, the normally bare portion can also have snow cover up to an amount WEPLOW (card I2) inches water equivalent (in. w.e.). (All snow depths and calculations are in terms of the equivalent depth of liquid water.) The snow covered and normally bare impervious areas are determined from fraction SNN1 (card I1). During single event simulation, subarea A4 retains 100 percent snow cover until it has all melted. During continuous simulation, an areal depletion curve, discussed earlier, is used.**
>
> **Similarly, for single event simulation, a fraction SNN2 (card II) of the pervious area remains 100 percent snow covered. During continuous simulation, the whole pervious area is subject to an areal depletion curve.**
>
> **<u>Initialization</u> •-- Initial snow depths (inches water equivalent) may be entered using parameters SNN3, SNN4 (card Il) and SNN7 (card I2). This is likely to be the only source of snow for a single event simulation although snowfall values may be entered as negative precipitation in card group E2. During continuous simulation, the effect of initial conditions will die out, given a simulation of a few months.**
>
> **No liquid runoff will leave the snow pack until its free water holding capacity (due to its porosity) has been exceeded. The available volume is a constant fraction, FWFRAC (card C1) of the snow depth, WSNOW. Hence, initial values of free water, FW, should maintain the inequality**

> There is no melt when TA \< TBASE. For single event simulation, the melt coefficient, DIN, remains constant. For continuous simulation it is allowed to vary sinusoidally from a minimum value on December 21 to a maximum value on June 21 (see Figure 4-22) in order to reflect seasonal changes.
>
> Melt coefficients and base melt temperatures may be determined both theoretically and experimentally. Considering the former, it is possible to first write a snowmelt equation from a heat budget formulation that includes all relevant terms: change in<sup>.</sup> snow pack heat storage, net short wave radiation entering pack, conduction of heat to the pack from underlying ground, net (incoming minus outgoing) longwave radiation entering pack, convective transport of sensible heat from air to pack, rnlease **of** latent heat of vaporization by condensation of atmospheric water vapor, and advection of heat to snow pack by rain. (It is assumed here that the pack is "ripe", i.e., just at the melting point, so that rain will not freeze and release its latent heat of fusion.) The equation may then be linearized about a reference air temperature and reduced to the form of equation 4-22. Exactly this procedure is followed in a detailed example presented in Appendix III.
>
> Alternatively, observed melt, in inches per time interval, may be plotted against temperature for that time interval, and a linear relation­ship developed of the form of equation 4-22. An often-cited such develop­ment for natural areas is illustrated in Figure 4-23 taken from the Corps of Engineers (1956). Viessman et al. (1977) also present a good discussion
>
> of degree-day equations. In the highly desirable but unlikely event that snowmelt data are available, the experimental procedure of Figure 4-23 is probabaly best for urban areas due to the considerable variation of snow pack and meteorological conditions that will be encountered, making reasonable theoretical assumptions more difficult.
>
> For natural areas, considerable range in melt coefficients exits, on the order of 0.0006 to 0.008 in/hr-°F (0.03 to 0.4 mm/hr-°C). Although base melt temperatures are nominally near the freezing point (i.e., 32°F or 0°C) they may be considerably lower depending on the exposure of the site and meteorological conditions. For instance, for the linearization performed in Appendix III a base melt temperature of 9°F (-13°C) was computed, which is valid only over the range of air temperatures used in the linearization (approximately 30 to 40°F or -1 to 5°C).

Handbook values (Chemical Rubber Co., 1976, pp. D218 - D267) for freezing point depression are plotted versus concentration in Figure 4-24 for several common roadway salting chemicals. Thus, the base melt temperature computed for pure water might be lowered by an amount taken from Figure 4-24 if an idea is known about the likely concentration on the roadway. The concentration will depend upon the amount of chemical applied and the amount of snowfall and might net be easily computed. An interesting alternative would be to let SW predict it!
>
> During periods (i.e., time steps) with rainfall, good assumptions can be made about relevant meteorological parameters for the complete heat balance melt equation. It then replaces the degree-day equation for "wet" time steps. A detailed explanation may be found in reference to equation III-8 in Appendix III. Melt during these time steps is linearly proportional to air temperature and wind speed.
>
> <u>Areal Depletion Parameters</u> -- In the earlier discussion of areal depletion curves it was noted that there would be 100 percent cover above a depth of SI inches water equivalent. Values of ST for impervious and pervious areas are read on card I2.
>
> For natural areas, Anderson (1973) recommends that a distinction be made on the basis of areal homogeneity. For a very heterogeneous area there are likely to be areas that receive little snow, or else it will quickly melt. The value of SI for such areas might be about the maximum depth anticipated. For homogeneous areas a much lower value would be appropriate.
>
> No specific information is available for urban areas; however, they are likely to be quite heterogeneous, especially if large, aggregated subcatchments are being used for the continuous simulation. Hence, a high value is probably indicated. Whichever values are used, they should be consistent with the form of the areal depletion curves entered in card groups C3 and C4. In general (depending somewhat on the areal depletion curve), the higher the value of SI, the more "stacked up" on a catchment is the snow, and snowmelt will occur at a lower rate over a longer time.
>
> <u>Snow Redistribution</u> -- The program allows (during continuous simulation) snow that falls on the normally bare impervious areas to be redistributed according to the fractions given as SFRAC on card I2. This is intended to simulate plowing and other snow removal practices in urban areas. Snow depths above WEPLOW inches water equivalent are thus redistributed according to Figure 4-25.
>
> The value of WEPLOW depends upon the level of service given the particular impervious area. That is, at what snow depth do removal practices start'? Some guidelines are provided by Richardson et al. (1974) in Table 4-12.

**The five fractions, SFRAC, should sum to 1.0 and are defined on the basis of the ultimate fate of the removed snow. For instance, if snow is plowed from a street onto an adjacent impervious or pervious area, fractions SFRAC(1) or SFRAC(2) would be appropriate. It may also be transfered to the last subcatchment (e.g., a dumping ground) or removed from the simulation (i.e., removed from the total catchment) altogether. Finally, it may be converted to immediate melt. Should variations** in snow removal practices need to be simulated, different subcatchments can be established for different purposes and the frac­tions varied accordingly.

<u>Surface Quality Input Data (Card Groups J1-L1)  
Overview of Quality Procedures</u> --

For most SWMM applications, **the Runoff Block is the origin of water quality constituents. Although effects of dry-weather flow and scour** and deposition may he included in the Transport Block, (dry-weather flow quality may also be included in the Storage/treatment Block), the generation of nasality constituents (e.g., pollutants) in the storm water itself can only be included in the Runoff Block.

Several mechanisms constitute the genesis of stormwater quality, most notably <u>buildup</u> and <u>washoff.</u> In an impervious urban area, it is usually assumed that a supply of constituents is built up on the land surface dur­ing dry weather preceding a storm. Such a buildup may or may not be a function of time and factors such as traffic flow, dry fallout and street sweeping. With the storm the material is then washed off into the drainage system. The physics of the washoff may involve rainfall energy, as in some erosion calculations, or may be a function of bottom shear stress in the flow as in sediment transport theory. Most often, however, washoff is treated by an empirical equation with slight physical justification.

As an alternative to the use of a buildup-washoff formulation, quality loads (i.e., mass/time) may be generated by a rating curve approach in which loads are proportional to flow to some power. Such an approach may also be justified physically and is often easier to calibrate using available data.

Another quality source is catchbasins. These are treated in SWMM as a reservoir of constituents in each subcatchment available to be flushed out during the storm.

Erosion of "solids" may be simulated directly by the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). Since it was developed for long term predictions (e.g., seasonal or annual loads), its use during a storm event in SWMM is questionable. But it is convenient since many data are available to support it.

A final source of constituents is in the precipitation itself. Much more monitoring exists of precipitation quality at present than in the past, and precipitation can contain surprisingly high concentrations of many parameters. This is treated in SWMM by permitting a constant concentration of constituents in precipilaLion.

> 119 4-69

Many constituents can appear in either dissolved or solid form (e.g., BUD, nitrogen, phosphorus) and may adsorbed onto other constituents (e.g., pesticides onto "solids") and thus be generated as a portion of such other constituents. To treat this situation, any constituent may be computed as a fraction ("potency factor") of another. For instance, five percent of the suspended solids load could be added to the (soluble) B0D load. Or several particle size - specific gravity ranges could be generated, with other constituents consisting of fractions of each.

Up to ten quality constituents may be simulated in the Runoff Block. All are user supplied, with appropriate parameters for each. All are transferred to the interface file for transmittal to subsequent SWMM blocks, but not all may be used by the blocks; see the documentation for each block.

Up to five user supplied land uses may be entered to characterize dif-ferent subcatchments. Street sweeping is a function of land use, and indi­vidual constituents. Constituent buildup may be a function of land use or else fixed for each constituent. Considerable flexibility thus exists.

When gutter/pipes are included, quality constituents are routed through them assuming complete mixing within each gutter/pipe at each time step. No scour, deposition or decay-interaction during routing is simulated in the Runoff Block.

Output consists of pollutographs (concentrations versus time) at de­sired locations along with total loads, and flow-weighted concentration means and standard deviations. The pollutographs may be plotted using the graph routines of the Executive Block (Section 2). In addition, summaries are printed for each constituent describing its overall mass balance for the simulation for the total catchment, i.e., sources, removals, etc. These sum­maries are the most useful output for continuous simulation runs.

In the following material, the processes described above will be dis­cussed in more detail. The various parameters will be related to individual card groups as appropriate.

<u>Quality Simulation Credibility</u> --

Although the conceptualization of the quality processes is not diffi­cult, the reliability and credibility of quality parameter simulation is very difficult to establish. In fact, quality predictions by SWMM or almost any **other surface runoff model are almost useless without local data for the** catchment being simulated to use for calibration and verification. If such data are lacking, results may still be used to compare <u>relative</u> effects of changes, but parameter magnitudes (i.e., actual values of predicted concen­trations) will forever be in doubt. This is in marked contrast to quantity prediction for which reasonable estimates of hydrographs may be made in advance of calibration.

Moreover, as will be discussed, there is disagreement in the literature as to what are the important and appropriate physical and chemical mecha­nisms that should be included in a model to generate surface runoff quality.

> 120 4-7O

The objective in the Runoff Block has been to provide flexibility in mecha­nisms and the opportunity for calibration. But this places a considerable burden on the user to obtain adequate data for model usage and to be famil­iar with quality mechanisms that may apply to the catchment being studied. This burden may often be ignored, leading ultimately to model results being discredited.

In the end then, there is no substitute for local data, that iS, flow and concentration measurements, with which to calibrate and verify the quality predictions. <u>Without such data, little reliability can be placed in the predicted magnitudes of quality parameters.</u>

<u>Quality Constituents</u> --

The number and choice of constituents to be simulated must reflect the user's needs, potential for treatment and receiving water impacts, etc. Al­most any constituent measured by common laboratory or field tests can be included, up to a total of ten. The name and concentration units are entered. as A-format variables in card group J3. These will be passed to subsequent blocks *(see* Section 2) and are used as column headings for tabular output of concentrations, as illustrated in Figure 4-26. This heading style is used in both the Runoff and Transport Blocks.

Options for concentration units are reasonably broad and broken into three categories, indicated by parameter NDIM in card group J3. Most con­stituents are measurable in units of milligrams per liter, mg/l. Although parameters such as metals, phosphorus or trace organics are often given as micrograms per liter, pg/l, the output of concentrations for NDIM=0 is F10.3 (allowing for three decimal places), and it is expected to be compatible with reported values of such parameters. Thus, the use of mg/1 should suffice for all parameters for which the "quantity" of the parameter is measured as a mass (e.g., mg).

A notable exception to the use of mass units is for bacteria, for which constituents such as coliforms, fecal strep etc. are given as a number or count per volume, e.g., MPN/1. Setting NDIM=1 accounts for these units (or any other type of "quantity" per liter, including mass if desired). Con­centration output for these constituents is given an E9.3 format.

A third category covers parameters with specialized concentration-type units such as pH, conductivity ((mho), turbidity (JTU), color (PCU), temperature (°C), etc. These are simulated using NDIM=2. For these param­eters, interpretation of concentration results is straightforward, but "total mass" or "buildup" is mostly conceptual. Since loads (e.g., mass/time) are • transmitted in terms of concentration times flow rate, whichever concentra­tion units are used, proper continuity of parameters is readily maintained. Of course, simulation of a parameter such as temperature could only be done to the zeroth approximation in any event since all Runoff Block constituents are conservative.

> **Each subcatchment must be assigned only one of up to five user supplied land uses. The number of the land use is used as a program subscript, so at least one land use card must be entered. Street sweeping is a function of land use and constituent (discussed subsequently). Constituent buildup may be a function of land use depending on the type of buildup calculation** spec­ified for each in **card group** J3. The buildup parameters DDLIM, DDPOW, and DDFACT in card group J2 are used only when constituent buildup will be a function of "dust and dirt" buildup. This is discussed in detail below.

> <u>Background</u> -- One of the most influential of the early studies of stormwater pollution was conducted in Chicago by the American Public Works Association (1969). As part of this project, street surface accumulation of "dust and dirt" (anything passing through a quarter inch mesh screen) was measured'by sweeping with brooms and vacuum cleaners. The accumulations were measured for different land uses and curb lengths, and the data were normalized in terms of pounds of dust and dirt per dry day per 100-ft of curb or gutter. These well known results are shown in Table 4-13 and imply that dust and dirt buildup is a linear function of time.

> From the values shown in the table, the buildup of each constituent (also linear with time) can be computed simply by multiplying dust and dirt by the appropriate fraction. Since the APWA study was published during the original SWMM project (1969-1971), it represented the state of the art at the time and was used extensively in the development of the surface quality routines (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, Section 11). In fact, the formulation and data may still be used in this present version of SWMM should the user wish to rely upon highly site specific results for Chicago. Needless to say, unless the application is in Chicago this is not recom­mended. Several useful studies have been conducted since the pioneering APWA work which permit much more selectivity.
>
> Of course the whole buildup idea essentially ignores the physics of generation of pollutants from sources such as street pavement, vehicles, atmospheric fallout, vegetation, land surfaces, litter, spills, anti-skid compounds and chemicals, construction, and drainage networks. Lager et al. (1977a) consider each source in turn and give guidance on buildup rates. But the rates that are (optionally) entered into the Runoff Block only reflect the aggregate of all sources.
>
> <u>Available Studies</u> -- The 1969 APWA study (APWA, 1969) was followed by sev­eral more efforts, notably AVCO (1970) reporting extensive data from Tulsa, Sartor and Boyd (1972) reporting a cross section of data.from ten US cities, and Shaheen (1975) reporting data for highways in the Washington, D.C. area. Pitt and Amy (1973) followed the Sartor and Boyd (1972) study with an anal­ysis of heavy metals on street surfaces from the same ten U.S. cities. More recently, Pitt (1979) reports extensive data gathered both on the street surface and in runoff for San Jose. A drawback of the earlier studies is that it is difficult to draw conclusions from them on the relationship between street surface accumulation and stormwater concentrations since they were seldom measured simultaneously.

> Amy et al. (1975) provide a summary of data available in 1974 while Lager et al. (1977a) provide a similar function as of 1977 without the extensive data tabulations given by Amy et al. Perhaps the most compre­hensive summary of surface accumulation and pollutant fraction data is provided by Manning et al. (1977) in which the many problems and facets of sampling and measurements are also discussed. For instance, some data are obtained by sweeping, others by flushing; the particle size characteristics

> and degree of removal from the street surface ;or each rncthcd. Some results of Manning et al. (1977) will be illustrated later. Surface accumu­lation data may be gleaned, somewhat less directly, from references on loading functions that include McElroy et al. (1976), Heaney et al. (1977) and Huber et al. (1979, 1980).
>
> Ammon (1979) has summarized many of these and other studies, specific­ally in regard to application to SWMM. For instance, there is evidence to suggest several buildup relationships as alternatives to the linear one, and these relationships may change with the constituent being considered. Upper limits for buildup are also likely. Several options for both buildup and washoff are investigated by Ammon, and his results are partially the basis fnr formulations in this version of SWMM. Recently, Jewel\] et al. (1980) also provide a useful critique of methods available for simulation of sur­face runoff quality and ultimately suggest statistical analysis as the proper alternative. Many of the problems and weaknesses with extensive data and present modeling formulations are pointed out by Sonnen (1980) along with guidelines for future research.
>
> To summarize, many studies and voluminous data exist with which to formulate buildup relationships, most of which are purely empirical and data-based, ignoring the underlying physics and chemistry of the generation processes. Nonetheless, they represent what is available, and modeling techniques in SWMM are designed to accommodate them in their heuristic form.
>
> <u>Buildup Formulations</u> -- Most data, as will be seen, imply linear buildup since they are given in units such as lb/ac-day or lb/100 ft curb-day. As stated earlier, the Chicago data that were used in the original SWMM formu­lation assumed a linear buildup. However, there is ample evidence that buildup can be nonlinear; Sartor and Boyd's (1972) data are most often cited as examples (Figure 4-27). More recent data from Pitt (Figure 4-28) for San Jose indicate almost liner accumulation, although some of the best fit lines indicated in the figure had very poor correlation coefficients, rang­ing from 0.35 S. r S 0.9. Even in data collected as carefully as in the San Jose study, the scatter (not shown in the report) is considerable. Thus, the choice of the best functional form is not obvious. Whipple (1977) has criticized the linear buildup formulation included in the original SWMM, although it is somewhat irrelevant since the user has long been able to insert his/her own desired initial loads, calculated by whatever procedure was desired, in card group LI. However, linear buildup between storms during continuous simulation has indeed been used in SWNM, until this present version.
>
> The choice of the proper functional form must ultimately be the re­sponsibility of the user. The program provides three options for dust and dirt buildup (Table 4-15) and thrcc for individual constituents (Table 4-16). They are the same three, as seen from the tables, namely:

1.  **power-linear,**

2.  **exponential, or**

3.  **Michaelis-Menton.**

**Linear buildup is simply a subset of a power function buildup. The shapes of the three functions are compared in Figure 4-29 using the dust and** dirt parameters (card group J2) as examples, and a strictly arbitrary assignment of numerical values to the parameters. Exponential and Michaelis-Menton functions have clearly defined asymptotes or upper limits. Upper limits for linear or power function buildup may be imposed if desired. "Instan­taneous buildup" may be easily achieved using any of the formulations with appropriate parameter choices. For instance, if it were desired to always have a fixed amount of dust and dirt available, DDLIM, at the beginning of any storm event (i.e., after any dry time step during continuous simula­tion), then linear buildup could be used with DDPOW = 1.0 and UDFACT equal

to a large number DDLIM/DELT. Linear buildup is "cheapest" to run in terms of computer time.

It is apparent in Figure 4-29 that different options may be used to accomplish the same objective (e.g., nonlinear buildup); the choice may well be made on the basis of available data to which one or the other func­tional forms have been fit. If an asymptotic form is desired, either the exponential or Michaelis-Menton option may be used depending upon ease of comprehension of the parameters. For instance, for exponential buildup the exponent (i.e., DDPOW for dust and dirt or QFACT(2,K) for a constit­uent) is the familiar exponential decay constant. It may be obtained from the slope of a semi-log plot of byildup versus time. As a numerical ex­ample, if its value were 0.4 day , then it would take 5.76 days to reach 90 percent of the maximum buildup (see Figure 4-29).

For Michaelis-Menton buildup the parameter DDFACT for dust and dirt (or QFACT(3,K) for a constituent) has the interpretation of the half-time con­stant, that is, the time at which buildup is half of the maximum (asymp­totic) value. For instance, DD = 50 lb at t = 0.9 days for curve 4 in Figure 4-29. If the asymptotic value is known or estimated, the half­time constant may be obtained from buildup data from the slope of a plot of DD versus t-(DDLIM-DD), using dust and dirt as an example. Generally, the Michaelis-Menton formulation will rise steeply (in fact, linearly for small t) and then approach the asymptote slowly.

The power function may be easily adjusted to resemble asymptotic behavior, but it must always ultimately exceed the maximum value (if used). The parameters are readily found from a log-log plot of buildup versus time. This is a common way of analyzing data, (e.g., Miller et al., 1978, Ammon, 1979, Smolenyak, 1979, Jewell et al., 1980, Wallace, 1980).

Prior to the beginning of the simulation, buildup occurs over DRYDAY days for both single event and continuous simulation. During the simula­tion, buildup will occur during dry time steps (runoff less than 0.0005 in./hr or 0.013 mm/hr) only for continuous simulation.

For a given constituent, buildup may be computed 1) as a fraction of dust and dirt, or 2) individually for the constituent. If the first option is used (KALC=0 on card group J3) then the rate of buildup will depend upon the fraction and the functional form used for a given land use. In other words, the functional form could vary with land use for a given constituent. If the second option is used (1 ≤ KALC 5. 3 on card group J3) the buildup function will be the same for all land uses (and subcatchments) for a given constituent. Of course, each constituent may use any of the options. Catchment characteristics (i.e., area or gutter length) may be included through the use of parameters JACGUT (card group J2) or KACGUT (card group J3), as described in Tables 4-15 and 4-17.

Units for dust and dirt buildup parameters are reasonably straight­forward and explained in Table 4-15. For example, if linear buildup was assumed using the Chicago APWA data (APWA, 1969), values for DDFACT could be taken directly from Table 4-13 for different land uses. Parameters JACGUT would equal zero. A limiting buildup (DDLIM) of so many lb/100 ft-curb could be entered if desired, and for linear buildup, DDPOW = 1.0.

Units for constituent buildup parameters depend upon parameter NDIM, that is, the units for the buildup parameters depend upon the units of the constituent. When NDIM = 0 and the constituent concentration is simply mg/1 (mass per volume), then buildup units are straightforward and given as pounds. When NDIM = 1, concentrations are given as some other quantity per volume, usually a bacteria count such as MPN/1. In this case buildup is simply in millions of MPN. The scaling is included to facilitate entry of large numbers.

When NDIM = 2, constituent concentrations are given in specialized units such as pH, JTU, PCU, °C, etc. "Buildup" of such parameters is rarely referred to; instead, a much more viable option is the use of a rating curve that gives load (i.e., concentration times flow) directly as a function of flow (discussed subsequently). However, the buildup option may be used with such constituents if desired. Within the Runoff Block, concentrations are ultimately computed in subroutine GUTTER by dividing a load (quantity per second) by a flow rate (cubic feet per second). Thus, if the quantity has units of concentration times cubic feet, the proper conversion will be made. This is the reason for the peculiar units requested in Table 4-17. The authors of this report have not seen data placed in this form, but such an analysis would be straightforward and analogous to computations of total mass in pounds (obtained by summing flow rate times concentration) for constituents measured in mg/l.

<u>Buildup Data</u> -- Data with which to evaluate buildup parameters are available in most of the references cited earlier under "available studies." Manning et al. (1977) have perhaps the best summary of linear buildup rates; these are presented in Table 4-18. It may be noted that dust and dirt buildup varies considerably among three different studies. Individual constituent buildup may be taken conveniently as a fraction of dust and dirt from the entries in Table 4-18, or they may be computed explicitly. It is apparent that although a large number of constituents have been sampled, little distinction can be made on the basis of land uses rOf roost of thew.

in card groups J2 and J3 and "all data" are used from Table 4-18 to com-\_<sub>1</sub>

pute_lust and dirt parameters. Since the data are given as lb"curb mile "

day , linear buildup is assumed<sub>i</sub> and_iommercial land use DD buildup would

be DDFACT = 2.2 lb"(100 ft curb) "day (i.e., 11<sup>6</sup>/<sub>5</sub>2.8, where 52.8 is the

number of hundreds of feet in a mile). DDPOW would equal 1.0 and no data are available to set an upper limt, DDLIM. Parameter JACGUT = 0 so that the loading rate will be multiplied by the curb length for each subcatch-ment. Constituent fractions are available from the table. For instance, QFACT values for commercial land use would be 7.19 mg/g gor BOD<sub>5</sub>, 0.06 mg/g for total phosphorus, 0.00002 mg/g for Hg, and 0.0369 10 MPN/g for fecal coliforms. Direct loading rates could be computed for each constituent as an alternative. For instance, with KALC = 1 for BOD<sub>5</sub> and KACGUT = 0, parameter QFACT(3,K) would equal 2.2 x 0.00719 = 0.0158 lb " (100 ft curb) " day .

It must be stressed once again that the generalized buildup data of Table 4-18 are merely informational, and are never a substitute for local sampling or even a calibration using measured concentrations. They may serve as a first trial value for a calibration, however. In this respect it is important to point out that concentrations and loads computed by the Runoff Block are usually linearly proportional to buildup rates. If twice the quantity is available at the beginning of a storm, then concentrations and loads will be doubled. Calibration is probably easiest with linear buildup parameters, but it depends on the rate at which the limiting build­up, i.e., DDLIM or QFACT(1,K), is approached. If the limiting value is reached during the interval between most storms, then calibration using it will also have almost a linear effect on concentrations and loads. It is apparent that the interaction between the interevent time of storms (i.e., dry days) and the effect of buildup is accomplished using the rate constants, DDPOW and DDFACT for dust and dirt and QFACT(2,K) and QFACT(3,K) for constituents. This is discussed further subsequently under "Overall Sensitivity to Quality Parameters."

Almost all of the above loading data are from samples of storm water, not combined sewage. Although some loadings may be inferred from concentration measurements of combined sewage (e.g., Huber et al., 1979, 1980, Wallace, 1980), they are not directly related to most surface accumulation measurements. Thus, if buildup data alone are used in com­bined sewer areas, buildup rates will probably be multiples of the values listed, for example, in Table 4-18. The proper factor will most easily be found by calibration with local concentration measurements. Alternatively the dry-weather flow mixing and scour routines in the Transport Block may be used to increase combined sewer concentrations. However, mixing of dry-weather flow with storm water has a negligible effect on concentrations dur­ing high flows, and the scour routine is highly empirical and adds a second calibration step. Hence, the easiest option for combined sewers is probably to calibrate as described earlier. Calibration may also be achieved using the rating curve approach.

Parameter LINKUP (card group J3) may be used to simulate this effect for continuous simulation. Of course, for single event simulation, buildup may be computed directly by the user and input in card group Ll or computed by any of the equations just discussed. Since there is only one storm simulated (ordinarily) there is no need for inter-storm buildup.**
>
> **<u>Washoff</u>** --
>
> **<u>Definition</u> -- Washoff is the process of erosion or solution of constituents from a subcatchment surface during a period of runoff. If the water depth is more than a few millimeters, processes of erosion may be described by sediment transport theory in which the mass flow rate of sediment is pro­portional to** flow **and bottom shear stress, and a critical shear stress can be used to determine incipient motion of a** particle resting on the bottom of a stream channel, e.g., Graf (1971), Vanoni (1975). Such a mechanism might apply in street gutters and larger channels. For thin overland flow, however, rainfall energy can also cause particle detachment and motion. This effect is often incorporated into predictive methods for erosion from pervious areas (Wischmeier and Smith, 1958) and may also apply to washoff from imper­vious surfaces, although in this latter case, the effect of a limited supply (buildup) of the material must be considered.
>
> <u>Washoff Formulation</u> -- Ammon (1979) reviews several theoretical approaches for urban runoff washoff and concludes that although the sediment transport based theory is attractive, it is often insufficient in practice because of lack of data for parameter (e.g., shear stress) evaluation, sensitivity to time step and discretization and because simpler methods usually work as well (still with some theoretical basis) and are usually able to duplicate observed washoff phenomena. Among the latter, the most oft-cited results are those of Sartor and Boyd (1972), shown in Figure 4-30, in which con­stituents were flushed from streets using a sprinkler system. From the figure it would appear that an exponential relationship could be developed to describe washoff of the form

**POFF is shown at; the ordinate of Figure 4-30. Alternatively, since the amount remaining, PSHED(t), equals PSHED,-POFF, then**

**where PSHED(t) = quantity remaining on surface at time, t,**

> **PSHED, = initial amount of quantity, and**
>
> **k = coefficient.**

**It is clear that the coefficient, k, is a function of both particle size and runoff rate. An analysis of the Sartor and Boyd (1972) data by Ammon (1979) indicates that k increases with runoff rate, as would be expected, and de­creases with particle size.**

**The Sartor and Boyd data lend credibility to the washoff assumption included in the original SWMM release (and all versions to date), that the rate of washoff (e.g., mg/sec) at any time is proportional to the remaining quantity,**

**The solution of equation 4-31 is equation 4-30. This was first proposed by Mr. Allen J. Burdoin, a consultant to Metcalf and Eddy, during the orig­inal SWMM development. The coefficient k may be evaluated by assuming it is proportional to runoff rate, r:**

> **k = RCOEF • r (4-32)**

**where RCOEF = washoff coefficient, in**<sup>-1</sup>**, and  
r = runoff rate over subcatchment, in/hr.**

**Burdoin assumed that one-half inch of total runoff in one hour would wash off 90 percent of the initial surface load, leading to the now familiar value of RCOEF of 4.6 in . (The actual time distribution of intensity does not affect the calculation of RCOEF.)**

**Even in the original SWMM release, this formulation did not adequately fit some data, and as a "correction," availability factors of the form**

> **AV = a + br<sup>c</sup> (4-33)**

**where AV = availability factor, and  
a,b,c = coefficients,**

**were multiplied by equation 4-29 in order to match measured suspended solids concentrations in Cincinnati and San Francisco (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, Section 11). The primary difficulty is that use of equations 4-31 and 4-32 will always produce decreasing concentrations as a function of time regardless of the time distribution of runoff. This is counter-intuitive, since it is expected that high runoff rates during the middle of a storm**

> **141 4-91**

**<u>might</u> indeed produce higher concentrations than those preceding. This may be explained by observing that concentrations are calculated by dividing the load rate (e.g., mg/sec.) to obtain the quantity per volume (e.g., mg/1). Thus,**

Hence, if the increase in runoff rate is sufficient, concentrations can increase during the middle of a storm even if PSHED is diminished.

**There are two parameters to be determined, RCOEF and WASHPO. Avail­ability factors of the form of equation 4-33 are no longer used since there is sufficient flexibility for calibration using only equation 4-35. Of course, the original SWMM methodology can be recovered using WASHPO = 1.0.**

**<u>Effects of Parameters</u> -- The effect of different values for RCOEF and WASHPO on PSHED and concentration is shown for four temporal distributions of run­off (Figure 4-31) in Figures 4-32 to 4-35. The basis for the calculations and plotted values is given in Table 4-20. It may be seen that concentra­tions may be made to increase with increasing runoff rate during the middle of a storm by increasing the value of WASHPO. However, perhaps counter in­tuitively, a larger value of WASHPO generally yields lower concentrations and higher values of PSHED. This is because the runoff rates used for the**

example are all less than 1.0 in/hr. (25.4 mm/hr.) and decrease in magni­tude when raised to a power. The reverse will be true for values of r \< 1.0. But many storms will have r \> 1.0 throughout their durations. Increasing the value of RCOEF always increases concentrations. (See also the subse­quent discussion under "Overall Sensitivity to Quality Parameters".)

In subroutine QSHED of the Runoff Block, washoff load rates (e.g., mg/sec) are computed instantaneously at the end of a time step using

equation 4-35. They are subsequently combined with other possible in­flow loads to a gutter/pipe or inlet before dividing by the total inflow rate to obtain a concentration. The remaining constituent load on the sub-catchment at the end of a time step is determined by using the average power of the runoff rate over the time step,

This calculation is done prior to application of ugg6on 4-35. The average

(trapezoidal rule) approximates the integral of r over the time step.

That the load rate of sediment is proportional to flow rate as in equation 4-35 is supported by both theory and data. For instance, sediment data from streams can usually be described by a sediment rating curve of the form

> <sub>G = aQ</sub>b (4-37)

where G = sediment load rate, mg/sec,

> Q = flow rate, cfs, and,
>
> a,b = coefficients.

Due to a hysteresis effect, such relationships may vary during the passing of a flood wave, but the functional form is evident in many rivers, e.g., Vanoni (1975), pp. 220-225, Graf (1971), pp. 234-241, and Simons and Senturk (1977), p. 602. Of particular relevance to overland flow washoff is the appearance of similar relationships describing sediment yield from a catch­ment e.g.. Vanoni (1975), pp. 472-481. The exponent b in equation 4-37 corresponds to the exponent WASHPO in equation 4-35, and the presence of the quantity PSHED in equations 4-35 reflects the fact that the total

quantity of sediment washed off of a largely impervious urban area is likely to be limited to the amount built up during dry weather. Natural catchments and rivers from which equation 4-37 is derived generally have no source limi­tation.

The use of rating curves in their own right is an option in the Runoff Block which will be discussed subsequently. At this point, however, results from sediment transport theory can be used to provide guidance for the magni­tude of parameters WASHPO and RCOEF in equation 4-35. Values of the exponent b in equation 4-37 range between 1.1 and 2.6 for rivers and sediment yield from catchments, with most values near 2.0. Typically, the exponent tends to decrease (approach 1.0) at high flow rates (Vanoni, 1975, p. 476). In the Runoff Block, constituent concentrations will follow runoff rates better if WASHPO is higher (see Figures 4-32 to 4-35). A reasonable first guess for WASHPO would appear to be in the range of 1.5-2.5.

Values of RCOEF are much harder to infer from the sediment rating curve data since they vary in nature by almost five orders of magnitude. The issue is further complicated by the fact that equation 4-35 includes the quantity remaining to be washed off, PSHED, which decreases steadily during an event. At this point it will suffice to say that values of RCOEF between 1.0 and 10 appear to give concentrations in the range of most observed values in urban runoff. Both RCOEF and WASHPO may be varied in order to calibrate the model to observed data.

The preceding discussion assumes that urban runoff quality constituents will behave in some manner similar to "sediment" of sediment transport theory. Since many constituents are in particulate form the assumption may not be too bad. If the concentration of a dissolved constituent is observed to decrease sixongly with increasing flow rate, a value of WASHPO \< 1.0 could be used.

Although the development has ignored the physics of rainfall energy in eroding particles, the runoff rate, r, in equation 4-35 closely follows rainfall intensity. Hence to some degree at least, greater washoff will be experienced with greater rainfall rates. As an option, soil erosion lit­erature could be surveyed to infer a value of WASHPO if erosion is pro­portional to rainfall intensity to a power.

An idea of the relative effect **of parameters** RCCEF acid WASHP0 **has been shown in Figures 4-32 to 4-35. Another view is presented in Figure 4-36 in which the time history of washoff is presented as a function of flow for various parameter values and for a more realistic runoff hydrograph. By variation of WASHPO especially, the shape of the curve may be varied to match local data. A plot using such data (Figure 4-37) is illustrated under the discussion of rating curves, and several such plots are given in Appendix VII.**

**<u>Related Buildup-Washoff Studies</u> --**

**Several recent studies are directly related to the preceding discus-siofis of the SWMM Runoff Block water quality routines. Some of these have been mentioned previously in the text, but it is worthwhile pointing out those that are particularly relevant to SWMM <u>modeling</u> as opposed to data collection and analysis (although most of the studies do, of course, utilize data as well). The following discussion is by no means exhaustive but does include several studies that have simulated water quality using buildup-washoff mechanisms, rating curves or both.**

**The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has performed comprehensive urban hydrologic studies from both a data collection and modeling point of view. For example, their South Florida urban runoff data are described and refer­enced in the EPA Urban Rainfall-Runoff-Quality Data Base (Huber et al., 1979, 1980). Urban rainfall-runoff quantity may be simulated with the USGS dis­tributed Routing Rainfall-Runoff Model (Dawdy et al., 1978, Alley et al., 1980a) which is presently being appended to include simulation of water quality. This will be accomplished using a separate program that uses the quantity model results as input. These efforts are described by Alley (1980) and Alley et al. (1980b). Alley (1981) also provides a method for optimal estimation of washoff parameters using measured data. The USGS procedures are based in part upon earlier work of Ellis and Sutherland (1979). These four references all discuss the use of the original SWMM buildup-washoff equations. An application of SWMM Runoff and Transport Blocks to two Denver catchments during which buildup-washoff parameters were calibrated is described by Ellis (1978) and Alley and Ellis (1979).**

**Work at the University of Massachusetts has developed procedures for calibration of SWMM Runoff Block quality (Jewell et al., 1978a) and for determination of appropriate washoff relationships for use in the Version II SWMM release (Jewell et al., 1978b). Recently Jewell et al. (1980) and Jewell and Adrian (1981) reviewed the supporting data base for buildup-washoff relationships and advocate using local data to develop site spe­cific equations for buildup and washoff. Most of their suggested forms could be simulated using the available functional forms in SWMM.**

> **153 4-103**

**Since several other models use quality formulations similar to those of SWMM, their documentation provides insight into choosing proper SWMM parameters. In particular, most of the STORM calibration procedures (Roesner et al., 1974, HEC, 1977a,b) can be applied also to SWMM (with WASHP0=1). Recent inclusion of water quality simulation in ILLUDAS (Terstriep et al., 1978, Han and Delleur, 1979) also is based on SWMM procedures. Finally, modified SWMM routines have been used to simulate water quality in Houston (Diniz, 1978, Bedient et al., 1978).**

**<u>Rating Curve</u> --**

**As discussed above, the washoff calculations may be avoided and load rates computed for each subcatchment at each time step by a rating curve method, analogous to equation 4-37,**

> **POFF = RCOEF • WFLOW<sup>WASHPO</sup> (4-38)**

**where WFLOW = subcatchment runoff, cfs, (or m<sup>3</sup>/sec for metric input), POFF = constituent load washed off at time, t, quantity/sec (e.g., mg/sec),**

> **RCOEF = coefficient that includes correct units conversion, and WASHPO = exponent.**

**Parameters RCOEF and WASHPO are entered for a particular constituent on card J3. That these parameters apply to a rating curve is indicated by parameter KWASH on card J3. Although used on a time step basis, the parameters for equation 4-38 are customarily determined on a <u>storm event</u> basis, by plotting total load versus total flow (Huber, 1980, Wallace, 1980).**

**Two differences are apparent between equations 4-35 and 4-38. First, the former includes the quantity remaining on the surface, PSHED, in the right-hand side of the equation, leading to an exponential-type decay of the quantity in addition to being a function of runoff rate.**

**Second, the form of the runoff rate is different in the equations. The power-exponential washoff, equation 4-35, uses a normalized runoff rate, r, in in./hr over *the* total subcatchment surface (not just the impervious part). The rating curve, equation 4-38, also uses the total runoff, but in an unnormalized form, WFLOW, in cfs. Since data for a particular catchment are often analyzed as a log-log plot of load versus flow, equation 4-38 facilitates use of the best fit line. For example, data for Seattle are plotted in Figure 4-37. In addition, Appendix VII contains several other similar plots for three Seattle catchments and for Lancaster, Pennsylvania.**

**Clearly, the rating curve will work better for some storms and param­eters than for others. If the data plot primarily as a loop (Figure 4-37), the power-exponential washoff formulation will work better since it tends to produce lower loads at the end of storm events. But if the load versus flow data tend to plot as a straight line on log-log paper, the rating curve method should work better. On the basis of the previous discussion of**

> **154 4-104**

rating curves based on sediment data, it is expected that the exponent, WASHPO, would be in the range of 1.5-3.0 for constituents that behave like particulates. For dissolved constituents, the exponent will tend to be less than 1.0 since concentration often decreases as flow increases, and concentration is proportional to flow to the power WASHPO-1. (Constant concentration would use WASHPO = 1.0.) Much more variability is expected for RCOEF. Should a value need to ***be*** entered for RC0EF that exceeds the field width of five available using the F5.0 format, an E-format may still be used with three place accuracy. For instance, the entry 243E3 will be read as 243,000 using an F5.0 format. This may often be necessary, since for constituents measured in mg/1 (NDIM=0), load rates in mg/sec will usually be quite large.

The rating curve approach may be combined with constituent buildup if desired. If KWASH=1 on card J3, constituents are generated according to the rating curve with no upper limit. There is no buildup ***between*** storms during continuous simulation, nor will measures like street sweeping have any effect. Constituents will be generated solely on the basis of flow rate.

Alternatively, with KWASH=2, the rating curve is still used, but the maximum amount that can be removed is the amount built up prior to the storm. It will have an effect only if this limit is reached, at which time loads and concentrations will suddenly drop to zero. They will not assume non-zero values again until dry-weather time steps occur to allow buildup (during continuous simulation). Street sweeping will have an effect if the buildup limit is reached.

<u>Street Cleaning</u> --

Street cleaning is performed in most urban areas for control of solids and trash deposited along street gutters. Although it has long been assumed that street cleaning has a beneficial effect upon the quality of urban runoff, until recently, few data have been available to quantify this effect. The best current study is probably that of Pitt (1979) in which street sur­face loadings were carefully monitored along with runoff quality in order to determine the effectiveness of street cleaning. According to Pitt, frequent street cleaning on smooth asphalt surfaces (once or twice per day) can remove up to 50 percent of the total solids and heavy metal yields of urban runoff. Under more typical cleaning programs (once or twice a month), less than 5 percent of the total solids and heavy metals in the runoff are removed. Organics and nutrients in the runoff cannot be effectively control­led by intensive street cleaning -- typically much less than 10 percent re­moval, even for daily cleaning. This is because the latter originate pri­marily in runoff and erosion from off-street areas during storms.

The removal effectiveness of street cleaning depends upon many factors such as the type of sweeper, whether flushing is included, the presence of parked cars, the quantity of total solids, and constituent being considered. Data from which an analysis of most of these efforts can be performed are available in Pitt (1979). For example, removal efficiencies for several

155 4-105

**constituents are shown in Table 4-21. Clearly, efficiencies are greater for constituents that behave as particulates.**

**Within the Runoff Block, street cleaning (usually assumed to be sweep­ing) is performed (if desired) prior to the beginning of the first storm event and in between storm events (for continuous simulation). Unless initial constituent loads are input in card group Ll (or unless a rating curve is used) a "mini-simulation" is performed for each consLituent. during the dry days prior to a storm during which buildup and sweeping are modeled. Starting with zero initial load, buildup occurs according to the method chosen in card groups J2 and J3. Street sweeping occurs at intervals of CLFREQ days (card J2). (During continuous simulation, sweeping occurs between storms based on intervals calculated using dry time steps only. A dry time step does not have runoff greater than 0.0005 in/hr (0.013 mm/hr), nor is snow present on the impervious area of the catchment.) Removal occurs such that the fraction of constituent sur­face load, PSHED, remaining on the surface is**

> **REMAIN = 1.0 - AVSWP(J) • REFF(K) (4-39)**

***Where* REMAIN = fraction of constituent (or dust and dirt) load remaining on catchment surface,**

> **AVSWP = availability factor (fraction) for land use J, and  
> REFF = removal efficiency (fraction) for constituent K.**

**The removal efficiency differs for each constituent as seen in Table 4-21, from which estimates of REFF may be obtained. The effect of multiple passes must be included in the value of REFF. During the mini-simulation that occurs prior to the initial storm or start of simulation "dust and dirt" is also removed during sweeping using an efficiency REFFDD (card J2). It is probably reasonable to assume that dust and dirt is removed similarly to the total solids of Table 4-21. A non-linear effect is exhibited in Table 4-21, in which efficiencies tend to increase as the total solids on the street surface increase. The Runoff Block algorithm does not duplicate this effect. Rather, the same fraction is removed during each sweeping.**

**The availability factor, AVSWP, is intended to account for the frac­tion of the catchment area that is actually sweepable, For instance, Heaney and Nix (1977) demonstrate that total imperviousness increases faster as a function of population density than does imperviousness due to streets only. Thus, the ratio of street surface to total impervious­ness is one measure of the availability factor, and their relationship is**

> **AVSWP = 0.6 • PD<sub>d</sub> <sup>-0'2,</sup> PD<sub>d</sub> \> 0.1 (4.40)**

**where AVSWP = availability factor, fraction, and**

**PD<sub>d</sub> = population density over developed area, persons/ac.**

**Such a relationship is reasonably a function of land use. Although a value of AVSWP must *be* entered for each land use (card J2), the equation of Heaney and Nix (1977) was developed only for an overall urban area. Thus, extra-**

Pitt shows that the percentage of curb left uncleaned is essentially equal to the percentage of curb occupied by parked cars.

In many cities, parking restrictions on street cleaning days limit the length of curb occupied during sweeping.**

For the example shown in Figure 4-38, ths is when the removal,** 0.3g • **PSHED, equals the weekly buildup, 0.3 x 10 • 7, or PSHED = 6.56 x 10 mg.

Sweeping would then occur during the first time step.)

> The SWMM user should bear in mind that although the model assumes constituents **to** build up over the entire subcatchment surface, the sur­face load, PSHED, is simply a lumped total in, say, mg (for NDIM = 0), and there are no spatial effects on buildup or washoff. Hence, if it is assumed that a particular constituent originates only on the impervious portion of the catchment, loading rates and parameters can be scaled accordingly. Likewise, AVSWP can be determined based on the characteriza­tion of only the impervious areas described above. However, if a constituent originates over both the pervious and impervious area of the subcatchment (e.g., nutrients and organics) the removal **efficiency, REFF, should be re­duced by the average ratio of impervious to total area since it is** indepen­dent of land type. The availability factor, AVSWP, differs for individual land uses but has the same effect on all constituents.

> <u>Background</u> -- Catchbasins are found in a large number of cities. They were originally installed at storm water inlets to combined sewers to prevent sewer clogging by **trapping coarse debris and solids and to prevent emanation of odors from the sewer by providing a water seal. There is no standard design for catchbasins; representative designs are shown in Figure 4-39. The purpose of the deep well or sump is to trap solids by sedimentation prior to stormwater entry into the sewer, which distinguishes catchbasins from stormwater inlets. The voluile of the** sump varies considerably with design, ranging from 2.8 to 78 ft (0.08 - 2.21 m ). The volume is typic­ally reduced by a large quantity of solids trapped in the sump, often by more than 50 percent.

**A comprehensive examination of catchbasins and their effectiveness for pollutant control is presented by Lager et al. (1917b). They con­clude that:**

> **"Existing catchbasins exhibit mixed performance with  
> respect to pollution control. The trapped liquid  
> purged from catchbasins to the sewers during each  
> storm generally has a high pollution content that  
> contributes to the intensification of first-flush  
> loadings. Countering this negative impact is the  
> removal of pollutants associated with the solids  
> retained in, and subsequently cleaned from, the  
> basin."**

**In fact according to their data, there is unlikely to be much removal (treatment) at all in most cities because of infrequent maintenance; the median cleaning frequency in 1973 was once per year. Without such maintenance, solids accumulate in the sump until there is little removal effectiveness, even for large particles. Lager et al. (1977b) conclude** that, with the possible exception of total solids and heavy metals, catchbasins are of limited usefulness for pollution abatement, both because of their ineffectiveness and because of their high maintenance costs. Hence, their treatment potential is not modeled in SWMM. (If it is significant in a given city, surface loadings could be correspondingly reduced.)

<u>Modeling Approach</u> -- The potential for a first flush of catchbasin material is simulated by assuming that the sump contains at the beginning of a storm a constituent load (e.g., mass, in mg, for NDIM = 0) given by

> PBASIN = CBVOL • BASINS • CBFACT • FACT3 (4-41)

where PBASTN = subcatchment constituent load in catchbasins at

beginning of storm, mg for NDIM = 0,

CBVOL = individual catchbasin volume of sump, seduced by

quantity of stored solids, if know, ft ,

> BASINS = number of basins in subcatchment,

CBFACT = constituent concentration in basin at beginning

of storm, mg/1 for NDIM = O, and

Parameter CBVOL is entered on card Jl as an average for the entire catchment. The number of basins in each subcatchment, BASINS, is entered in card group Ll. Numbers can be obtained knowing the general basin density for the catchment in lieu of the more tedious method of counting every one. Consti­tuent concentrations, CBFACT, are entered in card group J3 and should, of course, be measured in the catchment under study. Literature values are few. Samples from 12 San Francisco catchbasins (Sartor and Boyd, 1972) were characterized by Lager et al. (1977b) by "casting out the extremes and averaging," resulting in the values shown in Table 4-22.

161 4-111

>
> **Total-P 0.2 \<0.2 0.3**

**The values for COD and Total-N are consistent with a few samples reported by Sartor and Boyd (1972) for Baltimore and Milwaukee, although the "phosphates" concentration in these two cities was somewhat higher, 1.1 -** 2.2 mg/l. The concentration of BOD<sup>5</sup> in seven Chicago catchbasins was measured by APIA (1969). The average concentration for five commercial area basins was 126 mg/1, ranging from 35 to 225 mg/l. Two residential area basins yielded BOD<sub>5</sub> concentrations of 50 and 85 mg/l.

No data have been found to characterize other constituents within the catchbasins themselves. In particular, suspended solids (SS) concentrations can be expected to be high for particle sizes less than about 0.25 mm, on the basis of flushing tests (Sartor and Boyd, 1972, Lager et al., 1977b). Initial suspended and total solids concentrations of several thousand mg/1 are probably justified, although measurements by Waller (1971) <u>during</u> storms in four residential catchbasins in Halifax indicate SS concentra­tions in a range of 42 to 305 mg/1.

Flushing of stored constituents from catchbasin sumps is based on tests conducted by APWA (1969) in which salt was used as a tracer and its rate of flushing observed. Data and fitted equations are shown in Figure 4-40. The basin behaves approximately as a completely mixed tank in which

**where PBASIN<sub>o</sub> = initial catchbasin load.**

**If complete mixing occurs, k=1. For the Chicago tests this did not quite occur, as seen in Figure 4-40. The original SWMM version used k=1.6, but this does not give the best-fit line. Rather, a k value of 1.3 is con­sistent with a least squares fit through the data points and is used in this version of SWMM. (However, the difference is probably undetectable in a simulation.)**

**During a runoff event, equation 4-42 is used to calculate the load rate, dPBASIN/dt, at each time step. (Parameter BASINS represents the total catchbasin volume for the subcatchment.) The remaining catchbasin load is then computed by multiplying the load rate by DELT and subtracting from PBASIN. This crude Euler integration is justified because of 1) the weakness of field data and mixing assumptions, 2) the necessity for an additional array and computation time for a more sophisticated approxima­tion, and 3) insensitivity of most simulations to catchbasin flushing. The latter point will be discussed further subsequently.**

**<u>Regeneration of Catchbasin Loads</u> -- During continuous simulation, catchbasin loads are regenerated to their original values, PBASIN at a rate PBASIN<sub>0</sub>/ DRYBSN (e.g., mg/day) where DRYBSN is entered on card Jl and is the time required for complete regeneration from a zero load. No data are available herein to establish a value for DRYBSN, but it is likely that catchbasins are at "full strength" after only few days of dry weather.**

**<u>Effect on Simulation</u> -- It is the experience of the authors of this report that catchbasins have a negligible effect on most simulation results. Typ­ical drainage areas served by catchbasins range from 2.15 to 5.05 ac/basin (0.85 to 2.05 ha/basin) in the U.S. (Lager et al., 1977b). Unless the area served is low, surface loadings tend to overwhelm those from catchbasins. Although they do contribute to a first flush effect, the most important task in most simulations is to obtain a proper total storm load, to which catchbasins are seldom strong contributors. Hence, excessive effort to pin down catchbasin simulation parameters is seldom justified.**

**<u>Constituent Fractions</u> --**

**<u>Background</u> -- As previously discussed, the original SWMH Runoff Block qual­ity routines were based on the 1969 APWA study in Chicago (APWA, 1969). A particular aspect of that study that led to modifications to the first buildup-washoff formulation was that the Chicago quality data (e.g., Table 4-14) were reported for the soluble fraction only, i.e., the samples were filtered prior to chemical analysis. Hence, they could not represent the total content of, say, BOD<sub>5</sub>, in the stormwater. In calibration of SWMM in San Francisco and Cincinnati, five percent of predicted suspended solids was added to BOD to account for the insoluble fraction. This provided a**

**reasonable BOD<sup>5</sup> calibration in both cities.  
5**

> **164 4-114**
>
> **The Version II release of SWMM (Huber et al., 1975) followed the STORM model (Roesner et al., 1974) and added to BOD<sub>5,</sub> *N* and P0<sub>4</sub> fractions of both suspended solids and settleable solids. Adding a fraction from settleable solids is double counting however, since it is no more than a fraction of suspended solids itself. Furthermore, all the fractions in SWMM and STORM were basically just assumed from calibration exercises as opposed to being measured from field samples.**
>
> **Agricultural models, such as NPS (Donigian and Crawford, 1976) and ARM (Donigian et al., 1977) also relate other constituent mass load rates and concentrations to that of "solids," usually "sediment" predicted by an erosion equation. The ratio of constituent to "solids" is then called a "potency factor" and for some constituents is the only means by which their concentrations are predicted. The approach works well when constituents are transported in solid form, either as particulates or by adsorption onto soil particles. This approach can also be used in SWMM. For instance, one con­stituent could represent "solids" and be predicted by any of the means available (i.e., buildup-washoff, rating curve, Universal Soil Loss Equa-tiOn). Other constituents could then be treated simply as a fraction, Fl, of "solids." The fractions (potency factors) are entered in card group J4. As a refinement, two or more constituents could represent "solids" in different particle size ranges, and fractions of each summed to predict other constituents. Again, this approach will not work well for consti­tuents that are transported primarily in a dissolved state (e.g., NO<sub>3</sub>).**
>
> **<u>Available Information</u> -- In an effort to evaluate potency factors for vari­ous constituents in both urban and agricultural runoff, Zison (1980) ex­amined available data and developed regression relationships as a function of suspended solids and other parameters. His only urban catchments were three from Seattle, taken from the Urban Rainfall-Runoff-Quality Data Base (Huber et al., 1979), for which several water quality and storm event param­eters were available. Unfortunately, statistically meaningful results could only be obtained using log-transformed data, and simple fractions of the type required for input in card group J4 are seldom reported. Zison (1980) acknowledged this and suggested that model modifications might be made or piecewise-linear approximation made to the power function relationship. In any event, Zison related the total constituent concentration (not just the nonsoluble portion) to other parameters. Hence, for their use in SWMM, the buildup-washoff portion would need to be "zeroed out," (easily accomplished), as suggested earlier.**
>
> **Other reports also provide some insight as to potential values for the constituent fractions. For instance, Sartor and Boyd (1972), Shaheen (1975) and Manning et al. (1977), report particle size distributions for several constituents. However, the distributions refer principally to fractions of constituents appearing as "dust and dirt," not to fractions of total concen­tration, soluble plus nonsoluble. Finally, Pitt and Amy (1973) give frac­tions (and surface loadings) for heavy metals.**
>
> **If constituent fractions are used in SWMM, local samples should identify the soluble (filtrable) and nonsoluble fractions for the constituents of in­terest. Alternatively, the fractions may be avoided altogether by treating the buildvp-washeff or rating curve approach as one for the total concentra­tion, thus eliminating the need to break constituents into more than one**
>
> **form. 165 4-115**

**<u>Effect in Runoff Block</u> -- The fractions entered in card group J4 act only in "one direction." That is, nothing is subtracted from, say, suspended solids if it is a constituent that contributes to others. When the frac­tions are used, they can contribute significantly to the concentration of a constituent. For instance, if five percent of suspended solids is added to BOD<sub>5,</sub> high SS concentrations will insure somewhat high BOD<sub>5</sub> concentra­tions, even if B0D<sub>5</sub> loadings are small.**

**Units conversions must be accounted for in the fractions. For instance, if a fraction of SS is added to total coliforms, units for Fl would be MPN per mg of SS. In general, Fl has units of the "quantity" of KTO (e.g., MPN) per "quantity" of constituent KFROM (e.g., mg).**

**The contributions from other constituents are the penultimate step in subroutine QSHED. They occur after the Universal Soil Loss Equation cal­culation, and the to-from constituents can include the contribution from erosion if desired. Only the contribution from precipitation comes later and thus cannot be included in the constituent fractions. Rather it is added to the constituent load at the end of the chain of calculations, as described below.**

**<u>Precipitation Contributions</u> --**

**<u>Precipitation Chemistry</u> -- There is now considerable public awareness of the fact that precipitation is by no means "pure" and does not have character­istics of distilled water. Low pH (acid rain) is the best known parameter but many substances can also be found in precipitation, including organics, solids, nutrients, metals and pesticides. Compared to surface sources, rain­fall is probably an important contributor mainly of some nutrients, although it may contribute sustantially to other constituents as well. In particular, Kluesener and Lee (1974) found ammonia levels in rainfall higher than in runoff in a residential catchment in Madison, Wisconsin; rainfall nitrate accounted for 20 to 90 percent of the nitrate in stormwater runoff to Lake Wingra. Mattraw and Sherwood (1977) report similar findings for nitrate and total nitrogen for a residential area near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Data from the latter study are presented in Table 4-23 in which rainfall may be seen to be an important contributor to all nitrogen forms, plus COD, although the instance of a higher COD value in rainfall than in run­off is probably anomalous.**

**In addition to the two references first cited, Weibel et al. (1964, 1966) report concentrations of constituents in Cincinnati rainfall (Table 4-24), and a summary is also given by Manning et al. (1977). A comprehen­sive summary is presented by Brezonik (1975) from which it may be seen in Table 4-24 that there is a wide range of concentrations observed in rain­fall. Again, the most important parameters relative to urban runoff are probably the various nitrogen forms.**

**Uttormark et al. (1974) provide annual nitrogen (and phosphorus) precipitation loading values (kg/ha-yr) for many cities regionally for the U.S. and Canada. Their nitrogen loadings are shown in Figure 4-41**

**although it should be remembered that considerable seasonal variability may exist. These may be easily converted to precipitation <u>concentrations</u> required for SWMM input if the local rainfall is known, since kg/ha-yr cm/yr x 10 = mg/l. For instance, annual NH -N + NO** -N **loadings at Miami are almost 2 kg/ha-yr from Figure 4-41, and annual rainfall is 60 in (152 cm). From the above, the inorganic nitrogen concentration is 10 x 2/152 = 0.13 mg/1 which compares quite favorably with the sum of NH<sub>3</sub>-N and NO** -N **concentrations for two of** the **three Ft. Lauderdale storms given in Table 4-23. For a better breakdown of nitrogen forms, see Table 17 of Uttormark et al. (1974).**

**<u>Effect in Runoff Block</u> -- Constituent concentrations in precipitation are entered in card group J3. All runoff, including snowmelt, is assumed to have at least this concentration, and the precipitation load (e.g., mg/sec) is calculated by multiplying by the runoff rate and adding to the load already generated by other mechanisms. It may be inappropriate to add a precipitation load to loads generated by a calibration of buildup-washoff or rating curve parameters against measured runoff concentrations, since the latter already reflect the sum of all contributions, land surface and otherwise. But precipitation loads** might well be included if starting with buildup-washoff data from other sources.

For single event simulation, use of precipitation concentrations is **a**

**simple way in which to account for the high concentrations of several con­stituents found in snowpacks (Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren, 1976b). It would be inappropriate for continuous simulation, however, since such high concentrations in runoff would not be expected to persist over the whole year. If this is the only method used to simulate melt**

quality, however, a constant predicted concentration will result. Also, caution should be used if simulating particulates (e.g., suspended solids) or heavy metals since high concentrations in a snowpack do not necessarily mean high concentrations in runoff, since the material may rapidly settle during overland flow. -For instance, the very high lead concentrations (2 ­100 mg/1) found in snow windrows in urban areas are greatly reduced in the melt runoff (0.05 - 0.95 mg/1), (Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren, 1976b).

<u>Urban Erosion</u> --

<u>Background</u> -- Erosion and sedimentation are often cited as a major problem related to urban runoff. They not only contribute to degradation of land surfaces and soil loss but also to adverse receiving water quality and sedi­mentation in channels and sewer networks. Several ways exist to analyze erosion from the land surface (e.g., Vanoni, 1975), the most sophisticated of which include calculations of the shear stress exerted on soil particles by overland flow and/or the influence of rainfall energy in dislodging them. In keeping with the simplified quality procedures included in the rest of the Runoff Block, a widely-used empirical approach, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), has been adapted for use in SWMM. Full details and further information on the USLE are given by Heaney et al. (1975).

170 4-120

**<u>Universal Soil Loss Equation</u> -- The USLE was derived from statistical analy­ses of soil loss and associated data obtained in 40 years of research by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and assembled at the ARS runoff and soil loss data center at Purdue University. The data include more than 250,000 runoff events at 48 research stations in 26 states, representing about 10,000 plot-years of erosion studies under natural rain. It was developed by Wischmeier and Smith (1958) as an <u>estimate</u> of the <u>average annual</u> soil** erosion from rainstorms for a given upland area, L, expressed as the average annual soil loss per unit area, (tons per acre per year):

> L = R • K • LS • C • P (4-44)

where R = the rainfall factor,

> K = the soil erodibility factor,
>
> LS = the slope length gradient ratio,

C = the cropping management factor or cover index factor, and

> P = the erosion control practice factor.

This equation represents a comprehensive attempt at relating the major factors in soil erosion. It is used in SWIM to predict the <u>average</u> soil loss for a given storm or time period. It is recognized that the USLE was not developed for making predictions based on <u>specific</u> rainfall events. There are many random variables which tend to cancel out when predicting individual storm yields. For example, the initial soil moisture condition, or antecedent moisture condition, is a parameter which cannot be determined directly and used reliably. It should be understood by the SWHN user that equation 4-44 enables land management planners to estimate <u>gross</u> erosion rates for a wide range of rainfall, soil, slope, crop, and management condi­tions.

<u>Input Parameters</u> -- If erosion is to be simulated, it is so indicated by parameter IROS on card Jl. Note that at least one other (arbitrary) quality constituent must be simulated along with "erosion." No particular soil characteristics (e.g., particle size distribution) are assigned to the erosion parameter, and its title is "EROSION," with units of mg/1, in the output. Erosion may be added to another constituent, e.g., suspended solids, if desired using parameter IROSAD on card J1. However, the erosion parameter will also always be maintained as an individual param­eter throughout the Runoff Block.

> Other input parameters are:

1)  the maximum 30-minute rainfall intensity of the storm (single-event) or of the simulation period (continuous), RAINIT, (card Jl),

2)  the area of each subcatchment subject to erosion, ERODAR, (card K1),

3)  the flow distance in feet from the point of origin of overland flow over the erodible area to the point at which runoff enters the gutter or inlet, ERLEN, (card Kl),

> 171 4-121

4)  **the soil factor K, SOILF, (card Kl),**

5)  **the cropping management factor C, CROPMF, (card Kl), and**

6)  **the control practice factor P, CONTPF, (card Kl).  
    The source and use of these parameters is described below.**

**<u>Rainfall Factor and Maximum Thirty Minute Intensity</u> -- The rainfall factor, R, of equation 4-44 is the product of the maximum thirty minute intensity and the sum of the rainfall energy for the time of simulation. Rainfall energy, E, is given by an empirical expression by Wischmeier and Smith (1958),**

> **E = 1(9.16 + 3.31 log<sub>10</sub> • RNINHR<sub>i</sub>) • RNINHR<sub>J</sub> • DELT (4-45)**

**where E = total rainfall energy for time period of summation, 100-ft-ton/ac, RNINHR. = rainfall intensity at time interval j, in/hr, and**

> **DELT = time interval, hr, such that the product RNINHR • DELT = rainfall depth during the time interval.**

**The summation was performed over all time intervals with rainfall for a year for the original LISLE development; contours of R over the U.S. are given by Wischmeier and Smith (1965). However, it can also be performed for an indi­vidual storm. In SWMM this is performed on a time step basis; that is, E is evaluated at each time step using the rainfall intensity at that time step (no summation). The rainfall factor, R, is then**

> **R = E • RAINIT (4-46)**

**where RAINIT = maximum average 30-minute rainfall intensity for the**

> **storm (single event) or the period of simulation (continuous),**
>
> **in/hr.**

**RAINIT must be found from an inspection of the input hyetograph prior to simulation. Computed in this manner, the rainfall factor does not account for soil losses due to snowmelt or wind erosion. The units of R (100-ft-ton-in/ac-hr) are generally meaningless since the soil factor, K, is de­signed to cancel them. But the indicated units for RAINIT and RNINHR (in/hr) must be used.**

**<u>Erosion Area</u> -- Parameter ERODAR (card K1) represents the acres of the subcatchment subject to erosion. This would ordinarily be less than**, **or equal to the pervious area of the subcatchment and could indicate land that is barren or under construction.**

**<u>Soil Factor</u> -- The soil factor, K, is a measure of the potential erodibility of a soil and has units of tons per unit of rainfall factor, R. The soil erodibility nomograph shown in Figure 4-42 (Wischmeier et al., 1971) may be used to find the value of the soil factor once five soil parameters have**

> **172 4-122**

<img src="./media/image93.png" style="width:2.97292in;height:3.75625in" /><img src="./media/image94.png" style="width:1.95in;height:0.21667in" /><img src="./media/image95.png" style="width:1.70972in;height:0.1in" />

**been estimated. These parameters are: percent silt plus very fine sand (0.05-0.10 mm), percent sand greater than 0.10 mm, organic matter (0.M.) content, structure, and permeability. To use the nomograph, enter on the left vertical scale with the appropriate percent silt plus very fine sand. Proceed horizontally to the correct percent sand curve, then move vertically to correct organic matter curve. Moving horizontally to the right from this point, the first approximation of K is given on the vertical scale. For soils of fine granular structure and moderate permeability, this first approximation value corresponds to the final K value and the procedure is terminated. If the soil structure and permeability is different than this, it is necessary to continue the horizontal path to interact the correct structure curve, pro­ceed vertically downward to the correct permeability curve, and move left to the soil erodibility scale to find K. This procedure is illustrated by the dotted line on the nomograph. For a more complete discussion of this topic, *see* Wischmeier et al. (1971).**

**A preferable and often simpler alternative to the use of the nomograph of Figure 4-42 is to refer directly to the soil survey interpretation sheet for the soil in question, on which may be found the value of the soil factor. This is.illustrated in Figure 4-19 for Conestoga Silt Loam whereupon the K value is given as 0.43. Since this is site-specific local information, it is highly recommended. Local Agricultural Research Service and Soil Conser­vation Service offices are available to obtain the soil survey interpreta­tion sheets and to provide much other useful information.**

**<u>Slope Length Gradient Ratio</u> -- This parameter is an empirical function of runoff length and slope and is given by**

**LS =** ERLEN<sup>O</sup>**'**<sup>S</sup> **• (0.0076 + 0.53 • WSLOPE + 7.6 • WSLOPE<sup>2</sup>) (4-47)**

**where LS = slope length gradient ratio,**

> **ERLEN = the length in feet from the point of origin of overland flow to the point where the slope decreases to the extent that deposition begins or to the point at which runoff enters a defined channel, e.g., gutter/pipe or inlet, and**
>
> **WSLOPE = the average slope over the given runoff length, ft/ft.**

**Parameter ERLEN is entered with the erosion parameters in card group Kl. The slope, WSLOPE, is the same as for runoff calculations and will already have been entered in card group Hl.**

**In using the average slope in calculating the LS factor, the predicted erosion will be different from the actual erosion when the slope is not uniform. Meyer and Kramer (1969) show that when the actual slope is convex, the average slope prediction will underestimate the total erosion whereas for a concave slope, the prediction equation will overestimate the actual erosion. If possible, to minimize these errors, large eroding sites should be broken up into areas of fairly uniform slope.**

**<u>Cropping Management Factor</u> -- This factor** is **dependent upon the type of ground cover, the general management practice and the condition of the soil over the area of concern. The C factor (CROPMF in card group Kl) is set equal to 1.0 for continuous fallow gi:ouud which is defined as land that** has

> 174 4-124

**been tilled and kept free of vegetation and surface crusting. Values for the cropping management factor are given in Table 4-25 (Maryland Dept. of Natural Resources, 1973). Again consultation with local soils experts is recommended.**

**<u>Control Practice Factor</u> -- This is similar to the C factor except that P (CONTPF in card group Kl) accounts for the erosion-control effectiveness of superimposed practices such as contouring, terracing, compacting, sediment basins and control structures. Values for the control practice factor for construction sites are given in Table 4-26 (Ports, 1973). Agricultural land use P factor values are given by Wi.schmeier and Smith (1965).**

**The C and P factors are the subject of much controversy among erosion and sedimentation experts of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). These factors are <u>estimates</u> and many have no theoretical or experimental justification. It has been suggested that upper and lower limits be placed on these factors by local experts to increase the flexibility of the USLE for local conditions.**

**The P factors in the upper portion of Table 4-26 were designated as <u>estimates</u> when they were originally published. SCS scientists have found no theoretical or experimental justification for factors significantly greater than 1.0. Surface conditions 4, 6, 7 and 8 (P \< 1.0) of Table 4-26 also are estimates with no experimental verification.**

**<u>Subcatchment Quality Data (Card Group</u> L1) --**

**<u>Introduction</u> -- As discussed earlier while describing buildup and washoff mechanisms, certain quality parameters are unique to each subcatchment and are entered in this card group. These parameters are independent of the quantity parameters entered in card group H1 (except for subcatchment num­ber, of course) and are not required if no quality simulation is performed.**

**<u>Land Use</u> -- Each subcatchment is assigned one of up to five land uses defined in card group J2. Parameters entered for an individual land use will then be used on the corresponding subcatchments.**

**<u>Catchbasins</u> -- The total number is entered for parameter BASINS. (See earlier discussion of catchbasins.) In lieu of counting every one, BASINS may be computed if the general catchbasin density is known, e.g., 0.2 - 0.5 per ac (0.5 - 1.2 per ha) for most cities (Lager et al., 1977b). When BASINS = 0, no catchbasin computations are performed for the subcatchment.**

**<u>Gutter Length</u> -- Gutter or curb length, GQLEN, is used <u>only</u> for <u>quality</u> calculations for which buildup parameters are normalized as lb/100-ft curb, etc. (i.e., only when parameters JACGUT or KACGUT equal zero in card groups J2 and J3). This parameter may be measured directly by scaling the total length of streets off of maps and multiplying by two. As for other parameters, this is most economically achieved by measurements in a few repre­sentative areas and extrapolation to others.**

Curb length has been measured in several cities as a function of land use. Results for Tulsa and for ten Ontario cities are shown in Table 4-27. The Ontario results were compiled from aerial photographs. On a broad, total urbanized area basis, curb length has been related to population density, e.g., Graham et al. (1974) for the Washington, D.C. area. Manning et al. (1977) augmented the Washington, D.C. data with data from six other U.S. cities to develop the equation

> GD = 413 - 353 • 0.839<sup>PD</sup> (4-48)

where GD = curb length density, ft/ac, and PD = population density, persons/ac.

Subcatchment gutter length may then be obtained simply by

> GQLEN = ***GD •*** WAREA/100. (4-49)

where GQLEN = gutter (curb) length, 100-ft, and  
WAREA = subcatchment area, ac.

Equation 4-48 should only be used .<sup>-</sup>Eor large, areas, such as an aggregated subcatchment used for continuous simulation. Site specific data are always preferred in any event.

>
> **For continuous simulation, constituents will buildup between storms, (unless the rating curve option is used). These buildup parameters must be entered in card groups J2 and J3. The initial loading will have no effect after the first storm has ended except for a possible residual load (PSHED) remaining on the surface. The loading parameters on card group Ll are thus most easily adapted to single event simulation. They also provide one method of avoiding computation of an equivalent gutter length for land uses such as parking lots (if that type of normalized loading rate is being used).**
>
> **<u>Overall Sensitivity to Quality Parameters</u> --**
>
> **One of the advantages of computer simulation is that it permits examina­tion of the interactions between the complex precipitation time series and the various quantity and quality process of the catchment. It should be borne in mind that quality buildup processes in the model occur only during dry weather, and quality washoff processes occur only during storms (or during runoff due to snowmelt). For the moment it will be assumed that the rating curve approach is not being used.**
>
> **As a general rule, predicted concentrations and total loads are most sensitive to buildup rates. Twice the initial surface load usually means that about twice the load in the runoff will occur. (An obvious qualifica­tion is if washoff parameters are such that not all the material is washed from the surface during most storm events.) For instance, if linear build­up is used for dust and dirt, parameter DDFACT in card group J2 is a very important parameter. But the upper limit to buildup also enters the pic­ture.**
>
> **Consider the sketch in Figure 4-43. If the limiting buildup quantity is reached before a storm occurs, the results will be sensitive to the buildup limit (i.e., DDLIM or QFACT(1)) but not the rate. On the other hand, if the limit is not reached before a storm occurs, the results will be sensitive to the buildup rate (i.e., DDFACT or QFACT(3)) but not the limit. During continuous simulation the interevent time between storms varies, typically with an exponential probability density function. But**

> examination of the average interevent item should permit a sensitivity analysis of the type sketched in Figure 4-43. A similar argument could be made using power, exponential or Michaelis-Menton buildup functions
>
> The effect of street cleaning is also obviously related to average interevent time. Clearly if the interval, CLFREQ, exceeds the storm inter-event time, cleaning will have a decreasing effect. For example, for a continuous simulation of Des Moines, Iowa, street cleaning had essentially no effect for intervals greater than 20 days (Heaney et al., 1977). The average interevent time for Des Moines is about 4 days.
>
> Should it be desired to evaluate the average interevent time for pre­cipitation, the computer program SYNOP may be used to process the National Weather Service precipitation tapes. This is described in the EPA Area-wide Assessment Procedures Manual (EPA, 1976). Alternatively the SWMM Statistics Block may be used.
>
> Total storm loads will be sensitive to washoff parameters as long as they do not already produce 100 percent washoff during most storms. For examples, in many SWMM applications in the past, parameters RCOEF and WASHPO (equation 4-51) were set to 4.6 in<sup>-1</sup> and 1.O, respectively. This resulted in 90 percent washoff after 0.5 in (13 mm) of runoff (independent of the time, as discussed earlier). Since most applications of single event SWMM simulated storm events for which runoff was greater than 0.5 in (13 mm), total loads were insensitive to increases in RCOEF and relatively insensi­tive to decreases.
>
> This may still be true for single event simulations of "large" storms (i.e., depths greater than 0.5 in or 13 mm). But during continuous simula­tion the median runoff depth is likely to be considerably less than 0.5 in (13 mm), more on the order of 0.2 in (5 mm). Hence washoff coefficients will be relatively more important for continuous simulation. As an indica­tion of relative sensitivity, equation 4-36 can be rearranged for constant runoff rate, r, and for 90 percent washoff (PSHED/PSHED<sub>0</sub> = O.1) to give

> This relationship between RCOEF and WASHPO (linear on semi-log paper) is shown for d = 0.2 and 0.5 in (5 and 13 mm) on Figure 4-44 for various values of r. Note that for a half-inch of runoff, the familiar value for RCOEF of 4.6 is found for r = 1.0 in/hr or WASHPO = 1.O. The figure shows that for runoff rates less that 1.0 in/hr (25 mm/hr) RCOEF must be increased as WASHPO is increased to achieve the same percent washoff. The relationship is reversed for r \> 1.0 in/hr, but runoff rates this high occur only over

**brief intervals during a year. In fact, average <u>hourly</u> rainfall intensi­ties greater than 1.0 in/hr are rarely found in precipitation records. Hence, during continuous simulation, if RCOEF or WASHPO is changed, the other parameter should be increased if the same percentage total washoff is desired. Manipulations similar to equation 4-51 may be performed if a different percentage washoff is being considered.**

**During single event simulation it may occasionally *be* important to match the pollutograph (concentration versus time) <u>shape</u> to measured data, as well as the total storm load. The effect of RCOEF and WASHPO on pollu-tographs has already been discussed and illustrated in Figures 4-32 to 4-36. Generally, if the data show that concentrations tend to increase with flow rate, especially late in the storm, then WASHPO should be greater than one.**

**If a rating curve approach is being used buildup parameters will have no effect (KWASH = 1) or little effect (KWASH = 2). In general, as WASHPO increases beyond 1.0, the predicted loads and concentrations will closely follow flow variations. If WASHPO is less than 1.0, concentration will be inversely proportional to flow.**

**As has been discussed, catchbasins have only a small effect on total storm load and affect pollutographs only during the first several time steps of a storm. Their main effect is to enhance the first flush, if there is one.**

**The constituent fractions (card group J4) are capable of having a large effect on a few constituents if those constituents have added to them a large loading. Thus, if suspended solids (SS) are high and five percent of SS is added to BOD, BOD can also be high without any surface loading. Since the fractions interrelate the constituents, it is often easier to calibrate the model without them, although it may be more physically realistic to include them.**

**<u>Print Control (Card Groups M1 and M2)</u>**

**Two types of printed output are available from the Runoff Block. Ex­amples may be found subsequently in the section on case studies. Summary tables listing total flow volumes and quality loads by source are always printed. For continuous simulation options exist for the frequency of summaries (daily or monthly and annual) as indicated by parameter IPRDAY on card BI. Caution should be used in order not to produce excessive lines and pages of output.**

**The continuity check for quantity will ordinarily have an error of less than 1 percent, due to roundoff and the method of summing (numerically integrating) instantaneous flow rates. Should non-convergence messages be encountered, the continuity error could *be* somewhat higher.**

**The second type of output available is on a time, step basis. Single event SWMM (ICRAIN = 0) will print output for desired locations for the total event duration. Since there is no limit on time steps, it is possible**

**183 4-133**

for this output to be lengthy. However, the number of time steps between printing may be varied using parameter INTERV on card Ml.

For continuous simulation, time step print out is available for up to five specified time periods. The choice of these time periods must be made in advance and can be most reasonably accomplished by examination of the precipitation record prior to running the total continuous simulation. Recall that this is done by using ICRAIN = 4 for preprocessing of the precipitation (and temperature) records.

For single event simulation (ICRAIN = 0) all time step flows and concen­trations are <u>instantaneous</u> values at the indicated time. (In previous SWMM versions they were averages over the preceding time step.) In addition to the time step values, the total load, and flow-weighted averages and standard deviations are printed for flow and each quality parameter.

For continuous simulation (ICRAIN \> 0), <u>flows</u> are <u>time averages</u> over the previous time step. It was necessary to adopt this scheme to reduce large continuity errors that resulted when using a one hour time step for periods of a year or more. Computationally, the procedure is the same as outlined in Appendix V except that the average flow, Q, is found by insertion of the end-of-time-step depth, d2, found by equation V-37 into the continuity equation V-33. This is the way the Runoff Block formerly computed all flows and results in very low continuity errors at the expense of other computational incon­veniences.

The print control cards mark the end of Runoff Block input. A schematic of all required card input is given in Figure 4-45. Control is now returned to the Executive Block. For review of hydrographs and pollutographs and for ease of calibration, use of the graph routines described in Section 2 is highly recommended. Finally, continuous SWMM output may most conveniently be summarized using the Statistics Block.

**Footnotes Lo Table 4-28**

1.  **The main difference between "single event" and "continuous" SWMM is basically that the latter uses data sets or offline storage (e.g., disks) for storage of precipitation (and temperature) input data instead of dimensioned arrays, thus eliminating any restric­tion on the number of time steps. With the slight exception of snowmelt, all computations are done identically for the two cases. In addition, continuous SWMM produces extra daily, monthly and annual summary output which single event SWMM does not. See also footnotes 9, 10, and 20.**

2.  **This option may be used, for example, if it is desired to review the precipitation/temperature data prior to the simulation, perhaps for location of critical time periods for detailed output using card group Ml. To avoid the expense of reprocessing the NWS tapes, out­put** stored on unit NSCRAT(2) should be permaueaLly saved fur later use when ICRAIN = 2. This is done using appropriate job control language instructions. When ICRAIN = 4, only the following para­meters are required on card groups Al - Dl; others may be left blank (zero), although the print out of zeros may be misleading. Required parameters (allowing for some default values) are: card Al, TITLE; card Bl, ICRAIN (=4), ISNOW, INFILM, KWALTY, NDAY, MONTH, IYRSTR, IRPRNT, ICNTNS; card B2. DELT (=60.); card Cl, ELEV, SNOTMP, SCF, ANGLAT, DTLONG, LOCAT3; card C2, none; card C3, none; card C4, none; card CS, none; card D1, DhYSTP, MONSTP, LYRSTP, LOCATI, RTITLE. Input data end after card Dl. The usual instructions for skipping card groups should be followed, e.g., if ISNOW = 0, skip card groups CI-CS.

3.  The main differences between single event and continuous snowmelt simulation follow. For single event SWMM, snow covered areas are constant (areal depletion curves are used for continuous SWMM) and input parameters are fewer. In addition, snowfall quantities are not computed on the basis of air temperatures but may only be input, if desired, as negative precipitation intensities on card group E2. Melt coefficients are constant and there is no maintenance of the cold content of the snow pack, nor is there redistribution (e.g., plowing) from normally bare areas. For continuous SWMM, melt coefficients vary daily, from a maximum on June 21 to a minimum on December 21. Both modes use the same melt equations and melt routing procedures.

4.  Evaporation is used to renew surface depression storage and is also subtracted from rainfall and/or snowmelt at each time step. It has a negligible effect on single event simulation, but is important for continuous simulation. Evaporation is not used to deplete the snow pack, i.e., it does not also act: as sublimation, nor does it affect regeneration of infiltration capacity.

> 210 4-160

0.  **Used for information only for single event SWMM (ICRAIN = 0). This parameter does not affect computations, but it is passed to subsequent blocks.**

1.  **Used as subscript for monthly wind speed and evaporation data (card groups C2 and FI).**

2.  **Precipitation values printed one line per day, 57 days per page.**

> **A line is printed only for days with measureable precipitation and**
>
> **for the first day of each month.**

3.  **Conventional output from card groups M1 and M2 may also be used with continuous SWMM.**

4.  **There is now no limit on the number of time steps for any SWMM block. However, the allowable number of input values for precipitation and temperature data may provide an effective limit of 200 time steps in some cases. See card groups C5 and E2. When ICRAIN =1 or 4,:-(option=\]. for ICRAIN = 3) NSTEP will be calculated by program on the basis of nearest precipitation (and temperature) data to specified beginning and ending dates. (Ending date will always be reached, using zeroes for missing precipitation and temperatures at end of record, if required.) Note that continuous SWMM will always start and stop at midnight, such that computations are done for groups of whole days. If ICRAIN = 2, (use previously processed and saved precipitation and, possibly, temperature values), NSTEP must still be input and must be less than or equal to value <u>printed in output</u> from prior run using ICRAIN = 1 or 4.**

5.  **A 60 minute time step must be used when accessing National Weather Ser­vice (NWS) tapes (ICRAIN = 1, 2. or 4) since they provide hourly data, and the program is not equipped to average over longer time steps or to treat the hourly values as a step function for shorter time steps. This restriction, however, is due only to I/O complexity; all computa­tions use DELT as a variable.**

However, problems of conver­gence arise occasionally for gutter/pipe routing when too large a time step is used. These take the form of error messages print­ed from subroutine GUTTER, and usually mean that flow values com­puted at one or a few time steps are slightly in error. It may also result from an attempt to produce a negative outflow, neces­sary to satisfy continuity, but not allowed by the program. These problems can usually be eliminated by shortening the time step (e.g. reduce DELT from, say, five minutes to two and one-half**

16. See Figures 4-4 and 4-5 for description of areal depletion curve.

17. Value of ADC may = zero, but curve need not pass through (0,0); see Figure 4-4. Thus ADC can take on an arbitrary value for a small departure of AWESI from zero.

18. In program, AWESI is the ratio of actual snow depth (WSNOW) to depth at 100 percent cover (SI, read in card group I2).

19. Values are used computationally only for ICRAIN = 1 or 4. When ICRAIN = 2 or 3, ending date may be optionally determined from value of NSTEP. Card is required for continuous SWMM for these cases only to be able to print out values on card.

20. **Scratch mile number 2, NSCRAT(2), is used for storage of processed rainfall data for continuous simulation. NSCRAT(4) may also be used for this purpose for single event simulation, thus eliminating the restriction of 200 rainfall values imposed by the rainfall array dimension.**

Hence, if a dummy gutter/pipe is placed immediately downstream from a subcatchment, the inflow (or outflow) to the dummy gutter/pipe is the outflow from the subcatchment, (provided that that is the only subcatchment feeding the dummy **gutter/pipe).**

32. A maximum of five different subcatchments may feed to a single gutter/pipe or to a single inlet:, (in addition to gutter/pipes feeding the gutter/pipe or inlet:). If more "feeds" are desired, a dummy gutter/pipe may be used to provide additional feeds. See footnote 27.

33. The subcatchment width is a key calibration parameter, one of the few that can significantly alter the <u>shape</u> of the hydrograph,

> **rather than just the runoff volume. One way to think of the width is the area of the subcatchment divided by the average path length of overland flow (see Figure 4-13). The effect upon output hydro-graphs is illustrated in Figure 4-15 and is approximately as fol­lows. For rainfall durations less than the time of concentration, (i.e., less than the equilibrium time of an impervious subcatchment at which inflow equals outflow), increasing the width effectively provides a greater cross sectional area for outflow from the sub-catchment., thus increasing the magnitude of the peak flow and decreasing the time to peak. Decreasing the width has the oppos­ite effect, and the subcatchment surface acts more as a reservoir, reducing and delaying the peak. For rainfall durations greater than the time of concentration, the magnitude of the peak is affected only minutely. The time to equilibrium conditions, that is, the time of concentration, is reduced slightly for larger widths.**

To account for this lost storage in the system, the overall subcatchment width is correspondingly reduced (see Figure 4-20). Whether for one aggregated catchment or for a small individual subcatchment, a reasonable approximation for determining the width is to use twice the length of the <u>main</u> drainage channel in the catchment (see Figure 4-20).**

41. **The 10 or fewer constituents may be arbitrarily chosen (see text). When erosion is simulated it is stored as the last constituent.

46. If JACGUT = 0, parameters DDLIM and DDFACT will be multiplied by GQLEN (card group L1) in 100-ft. If JACGUT = 1, parameters DDLIM and DDFACT will be multiplied by WAREA (card group H1) in acres.

47. For continuous simulation, street sweeping occurs at intervals of CLFREQ days, computed during the simulation using <u>dry</u> time steps only (no runoff and no unmelted snow on normally bare impervious areas). When cleaning occurs, a fraction of each pollutant, REFF-AVSWP, is removed from each subcatchment. The availability factor AVSWP, is intended to account for the relative amount of subcatchment surface that consists of streets, and therefore may be swept. See text.

> At start of single-event and continuous simulations, streets are swept approximately DRYDAY/CLFREQ times, each time removing a fraction REFF.AVSWP. Parameter DSLCL establishes proper backwards time sequence.

48. The constituent names and units established in this card group will be carried through to subsequent SWIIN blocks. See Figure 4-26 for illus­tration of how the A-format names and units will appear as headings.

49. Since most constituents are meaHurable in mass units, NDIM = 0 will be the most common. Since concentrations will be printed using an F10.3 format, NDIM = 0 should suffice also for consti­tuents whose concentrations are usually given in pg/l. The value of NDIM basically affects conversion factors used in the program.

52. For instance, if chlorides are simulated, they might be only applied for street salting when snow is present. The <u>rate</u> of buildup will not be a function of the <u>amount</u> of snow, however.

54. This concentration is assumed to be that of the runoff (and snow-melt) before adding washoff loads. The precipitation load is always added regardless of the washoff mechanism utilized,

55. After computing and summing all loads except rainfall, a fraction of any constituent may be added to any other. (No fractions are <u>removed,</u> however.) This is intended to account for insoluble BOD etc. if surface loadings are based only on insoluble portions,• as is true, for instance, for 1969 APWA data from Chicago. For instance, 5 percent of suspended solids could be added to BOD. Alternatively, different particle size ranges could be generated as different constituents, and other constituents could consist of fractions of the first group of different particle sizes. When these fractions are used, concentrations can be drastically (and subtly) increased if, for instance, suspended solids are high, soluble LOD is low and a fraction of 0.05 is used. The choice of whether or not any fractions should be entered depends upon how constituent data are being reported (e.g. total BOD or only the soluble fraction) and on how it is desired to simulate each con­stituent in SWMM.

56. See text for explanation of method of computation, parameters and typical values. Also, there may be a need to consult with local Soil Conservation Service or Agricultural Research Service or state agricultural extension service experts for knowledge of parameter values for particular areas.

EXTENDED TRANSPORT BLOCK

> Following development of the original SWMM model, Water Resources Engineers (now, Camp, Dresser and McKee) participated in a study of the proposed master plan for control of combined sewer overflows in San Francisco. In order to analyze the complex hydraulics of that system, they developed the WRE Transport Model (Shubinski and Roesner, 1973), one that solves the coupled complete St. Venant equations and accounts for phenomena such as backwater, looped connections, surcharging and pressure flow that were either not considered or treated in a very simplified manner in the original Transport Model (Section 6). Through subsequent work for EPA in other cities the WRE Transport Model was acquired for the SWMM package and became known as the Extended Transport Model or Extran. This model has few peers in its capacity for simulation of the hydraulics of urban drainage system and is probably the most sophisticated such model that is non-proprietary and available in the public domain. (Similar proprietary models do exist.) Extran capabil­ities are compared with those of Runoff and Transport in Table 4-3.
>
> Extran has been part of the SWMM package since 1976. However, it has been rather poorly documented and the quality portion has never been used. In fact, the only (but very extensive) use for the model has been for hydraulic analysis, and the quality routing has been formally removed from the program. The state of the art in urban runoff quality modeling is such that adequate simulation of pollutographs may be performed using the simpler hydraulics of the Runoff and Transport Blocks.
>
> Comprehensive new documentation of Extran for this Version III of SWMM has been prepared by Camp, Dresser and McKee and is included as a separate addendum to this User's Manual (Roesner et al., 1981). Full details of the model are available therein. Interfacing between Extran and the remainder of SWMM is performed as described in Section 2.

SECTION 6

TRANSPORT BLOCK

BLOCK DESCRIPTION

<u>Introduction</u>

Flow routing through the sewer system may be accomplished in the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) by subroutine TRANS which is called from the Executive Block program. TRANS has the responsibility of coordinating not only routing of sewage quantities but also such functions as routing of quality parameters (subrouting QUAL), estimating dry-weather flow (DWF) (subrouting FILTH), estimating infiltration (subroutine INFIL), and calling internal storage (subroutine TSTRDT). The relationships among the subrou­tines which make up the Transport Block are shown in Figure 6-1. The pro­gram is about 5,000 cards long, consisting of 24 subroutines and functions.

This section describes the Transport Block, provides instructions on data preparation, and furnishes examples of program usage. Instructions are provided for these subroutines requiring card input data, namely: transport, internal storage, infiltration, and DWF. Examples, with sample I/O data, are given for transport, infiltration, and DWF computations.

<u>Broad Description of Flow Routing</u>

Differences in flow routing techniques among the Runoff, Transport and Extended Transort Blocks were described in Section 4 (e.g., Table 4-3); the techniques increase in complexity in the order just listed. A brief descrip­tion of techniques used in the Transport Block follows.

To categorize a sewer system conveniently prior to flow routing, each component of the system is classified as a certain type of "element." All elements in combination form a conceptual representation of the system in a manner similar to that of links and nodes. Elements may be conduits, man­holes, lift stations, overflow structures, or any other component of a real system. Conduits themselves may be of different element types depending upon their geometrical cross-section (e.g., circular, rectangular, horse­shoe). A sequencing is first performed (in subroutine SLOP) to order the numbered elements for computations. Flow routing then proceeds downstream through all elements during each increment in time until the storm hydro-graphs have been passed through the system.

The solution procedure is described in detail in the original SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a) and basically follows a kinematic wave approach in which disturbances are allowed to propagate only

> 220 6-1
>
> **in the downstream direction. As a consequence, backwater effects are not modeled beyond the realm of a single conduit, and downstream conditions (e.g., tide gates, diversion structures) will not affect upstream computa­tions. Systems that branch in the downstream direction can be modeled using "flow divider" elements to the extent that overflows, etc., are not affected by backwater conditions. Surcharging is modeled simply by storing excess flows (over and above the fullflow conduit capacity) at the upstream manhole until capacity exists to accept** the stored volume. Pressure-flow conditions **are not explicitly modeled and no attempt is made to determine if ground surface flooding exists. However, a message is printed at each time step for each location at which surcharging occurs. The Transport Block has proven its ability to model accurately flows in most sewer systems, within the limitations discussed above, and as such it should be adequate for most applications. However, it will not accurately simulate systems with exten­sive interconnections or loops, systems that exhibit flow. reversals or significant backwater effects, or systems in which surcharging must be treated as a pressure-flow phenomenon; the Extended Transport Block should** be used for this purpose (Section 5).
>
> An option in the program is the use of the internal storage **model which acts as a transport element. It is a scaled-down version of the Storage/ Treatment Block (Section 7) and provides the possibility of storagerouting of the storm at one or two separate** points within the sewer system (restricted by computer core capacity). The program routes the flow through the storage unit for each time step based on the continuity equation in a manner analogous to flood routing through a reservoir. Extensive backwater conditions may thus be modeled by treating portions of the sewer system as a storage unit with a horizontal water surface.
>
> <u>Broad Description of Quality Routing</u>
>
> Up to four contaminants are also handled by the Transport Block. Con­stituents may be introduced to the sewer system by any combination of four means:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 12%" />
<col style="width: 87%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1)</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Storm;generated pollutographs computed by an upstream block are transferred on tape/disk devices (the interface file of Section 2) to enter the system at designated inlet manholes.</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

2)  Storm-generated pollutographs may be entered on cards at designated inlet manholes.

3)  Residual bottom sediment in the pipes may be resuspended due to the flushing action of the storm flows (subroutine DWLOAD).

4)  For combined systems, dry-weather flow pollutographs (sub­routine FILTH) may be entered at designated inlet manholes.

<sup>d</sup>The Transport Block can receive inputs from the Runoff, Storage/Treatment,

> Extran, and Transport Block itself.
>
> 222 6-3

The routing of the pollutants is then done for each time step by subroutine QUAL. The maximum number of contaminants that can be routed is four. These may be selected arbitrarily from the input file, except that the FILTH rou­tine can only be used to generate suspended solids, BOD<sub>5</sub> and total coliforms. The scour/deposition routines may be used for any constituent.

<u>rrogram Operation</u>

Most of the input to TRANS is related to data needed to describe the particular sewer system being modeled (e.g., dimensions, slopes, roughnesses, etc.) and parameters needed to solve the governing flow routing equations.

Following input of these data, the sewer elements are sequenced for computations in subroutine SLOP. Certain geometric and flow parameters are then initialized in subroutine FIRST while others are initialized in TRANS. The various program parameters and initialized variables describing the elements are then printed. Parameters relating to the amount of data to be stored and printed out are also read (from cards).

If indicated, infiltration values will be calculated in subroutine INFTL and DWF quantity and quality parameters will be calculated in subroutine FILTH. Alternatively, user supplied values may simply be input at any manhole loca­tion. If desired, subroutine DWLOAD then initializes constituent depositions, and subroutine INITAL initializes flows and pollutant concentrations in each element to values corresponding to a condition of dry-weather flow and infiltration only.

The main iterations of the program consist of an outer loop on time steps and an inner loop on element numbers in order to calculate flows and concentrations in all elements at each time step. Inlet hydrographs and pollutograph ordinates are read from the interface file and/or cards to permit linear interpolation for values at each time step prior to entering the loop of element numbers.

When in the loop on element numbers (with index I), the current sewer element through which flows are to be routed, indicated by the variable M, is determined from the vector JR(I). This array is calculated in subroutine SLOP in a manner to insure that prior to flow routing in a given element, all flows upstream will have been calculated.

When calculating flows in each element, the upstream flows are summed and added to surface runoff, DWF, and infiltration entering at that element. These latter three quantities are allowed to enter the system only at non-conduits (e.g., manholes, flow dividers). If the element is a conduit, a check for surcharging is made. If the inflow exceeds the conduit capacity, excess flow is stored at the element just upstream (usually a manhole) and the conduit is assumed to operate at full-flow capacity until the excess flow can be transmitted. A message indicating surcharging is printed.

A simple hydraulic design routine is available at this point. If desired (NDESN = 1), when a surcharge condition is encountered, the conduit will be increased in size in standard increments (for circular pipes) or in

> 223 6-4
>
> six-inch width increments for rectangular conduits until capacity exists to accept the flow. (Conduits that are neither circular nor rectangular will be converted to circular if they need to be resized.) A message is printed indicating the resizing, and a table of final conduit dimensions is printed at the end of the simulation. This design operation will effectively elimi­nate surcharging but will also minimize in-system storage within manholes, etc. The net effect is to increase hydrograph peaks at the downstream end of the system. An obvious conflict can thus exist between controls aimed at curing in-system hydraulic problems and controls intended for pollution abatement procedures at the outfall.
>
> Flows are routed through each element in subroutine ROUTE and quality parameters are routed in subroutine QUAL. When routing flows in conduits, ROUTE may be entered more than once depending upon the value of ITER, the number of iterations. It is necessary to iterate upon the solution in certain cases because of the implicit nature of calculating the energy grade line in ROUTE.
>
> Upon completion of flow and quality routing at all time steps for all elements, TRANS then performs the task of outputting the various data. Hydrograph and pollutograph ordinates for any specified outfall point(s) may be written onto an interface file for further use by the Executive Block, and subroutine PRINTQ (or PRINTF for flows only) is then called for printing outflows for any of up to 80 desired elements.
>
> <u>Off-Line Files</u>
>
> The Transport Block uses two scratch data sts, NSCRAT(1) and NSCRAT(2), for storage of input and output hydrographs and pollutographs prior to print­ing. These are specified in the Executive Block using job control language (JCL) appropriate to the computer system. No input data will be sought from the interface file (Section 2) if JIN = 0, and no output will be placed on the file if JOUT = 0.

> INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATA PREPARATION  
> <u>Introduction</u>
>
> Instructions for data preparation for the Transport Block have been di­vided along the lines of the major components for clarity of the presenta­tion. These components are: (1) Transport, (2) Quality, (3) Internal Storage, (4) Infiltration and (5) Dry-Weather Flow. All data input card and tape/disk sources enter the Transport Block through one of these components. The typical data deck setup for the complete Transport Block is shown in Figure 6-2. Transport data describe the physical characteristics of the conveyance system. Quality data identify pollutants to be routed and their characteristics. Internal Storage data describe a particular type of Trans­port element. Infiltration and DWF data describe the necessary drainage area characteristics to permit the computation of the respective inflow quantities and qualities. Data card preparation and sequencing instructions for the complete Transport Block are given at the end of these instructions in Table 6-6.

3)  Generation of inlet hydrographs and pollutographs required as input to the Transport Block and computational controls.

> Data for Step 1 are supplied with the SWMM program for 13 different conduit shapes, and it will only be necessary for the user to generate supplemental data in special instances.

This function is tabulated for circular conduits in Appendix A of Chow (1959), for example, and on page 443 of Davis (1952) for a Boston horseshoe section. It is shown in graphical form for several conduit shapes in Chapter XI of Metcalf and Eddy (1914) from which some data supplied with this program have been generated. A list of the conduit shapes supplied with the Transport Block as well as all other element types is given in Table 6-1. The conduits are illustrated in Figure 6-4. If y = depth of flow, values of y/y<sub>f</sub> corresponding to A/A<sub>f</sub> (ANORM) are tabulated as the variable DNORM.**

>
> If it is desired to hve the exact flow-area and depth-area relation­ships, then the product AR<sup>213</sup> must be found as a function of area. In gen­eral, the mathematical description of the shape will be complex and the task is most easily carried out graphically. Areas may be planimetered, and the wetted perimeter measured to determine R. In addition, the depth may be measured with a scale. The required flow-area relationship of Equation 6-1 may then be tabulated as can the depth-area relationship. The number of points on the flow-area and depth-area curves required to describe the curves is an input variable (MM and NN, respectively). Note that the nor­malized flows (QNORM) and depths (DN0RM) must be tabulated at points corres­ponding to MM-1 and NN-1, respectively, <u>equal</u> divisions of the normalized area axis (ANORM). If desired, the routing parameters stored in the program may be listed by specifying KPRINT = 1 on card Al. The four pages of output are seldom necessary during the simulations, however.
>
> <u>Step 2. The Physical Representation of the Sewer System</u> --
>
> <u>General</u> -- These data are the diffe:-ent element types of the sewer system and their physical descriptions. The system must first be as a network of conduit lengths, joined at manholes (or other nonconduits). In addition, either real or hypothetical manholes should delineate significant changes in conduit geometry, dimensions, slope, or roughness. Finally, inflows to the system (i.e., stormwater, wastewater, and infiltration) are allowed to enter only at manholes (or other non-conduits). Thus, manholes must be located at points corresponding to inlet points for hydrographs generated by an external block and input points specified in subroutines FILTH and INFIL. In general, the task of identifying elements of the sewer system will be done most con­veniently in conjunction with the preparation of data for these other sub­routines, especially the Runoff Block.

> Each element (conduit or non-conduit) must be identified with a number which may range from 1 to 1000. They need not be sequential or continuous. Experience has shown that a schematic map showing the complete sewer network and the numbering system will be very useful for debugging and identification purposes. It is difficult to rely upon detailed (and often cluttered) sewer plans alone.
>
> <u>Description of Conduits</u> -- The 13 conduit. shapes supplied with the Wrili are shown in Figure 6-4. For each shape, the required dimensions are illustrated in the figure and specified in Table 6-2. In addition, Table 6-2 gives the formula for calculating the total cross-sectional area of the conduit.
>
> Usually, the shape and dimensions of the conduit will be indicated on plans. It is then a simple matter to refer to Figure 6-4 for the proper con­duit type and dimensions. If the shape does not correspond to any supplied by the program, it will ordinarily suffice to choose a shape corresponding most nearly to the one in question. For example, an inverted egg can be reasonably approximated by a catenary section. The dimensions of the substi­tute shape should be chosen so that the area of the substitute conduit and that of the actual conduit are the same. This is facilitated by Table 6-2, in which the area is given as a function of conduit dimensions. If desired, the flow-depth area parameters for up to two additional conduit shapes may be read in at the beginning of the program as discussed previously. (See also Card Groups B1-B9, Table 6-6.)
>
> Occasionally, the conduit dimensions and area may be given, but the shape not specified. It will sometimes be possible to deduce the shape from the given information. For example, a conduit may have an area of 4.58 ft<sup>2</sup>. (0.425 m<sup>2</sup>) and dimensions of 2 ft by 3 ft (0.6 by 1.0 m). First, assume that the 2 foot dimension is the width and the 3 foot dimension is the depth of the conduit. Second, note from Figure 6-4 that the ratio of depth to width for an egg-shaped conduit is 1.5:1. Finally, the area of an egg-shaped con-
>
> duit of 3 foot depth is 0.5105 x 9 4.59 ft<sup>2</sup> (0.426 m<sup>2</sup>). It is concluded  
> that the conduit should be type 3 with GEOM1 = 3 ft.
>
> Because of the limits on the size of the computer program, it will usually not be possible to model every conduit in the drainage basin. Conse­quently, aggregation of individual conduits into longer ones will usually be the rule. Average slopes and sizes may be used provided that the flow capac­ity of the aggregate conduit is not significantly less than that of any por­tion of the real system. This is to avoid simulated surcharge conditions that would not occur in reality. In general, flow calculations are rela­tively insensitive to conduit lengths although with conduits over 4000 to 5000 ft (1200 m and 1500 m) long some loss of routing accuracy will result. This is caused primarily when a large inflow enters a dry or nearly dry pipe, often at the beginning of the simulation. A non-convergence error message will be printed, but the resultant error is seldom significant. Conduit lengths should always be separated by manholes (or other non-conduit type elements). The conduit length should be measured from the center of the adjacent manholes. A further means of simulating large systems lies ia simulating different portions with separate Transport runs and combining the results using the Combine Block (see Section 3).

**Values of Manning's roughness may be known by engineers familiar with the sewer system. Otherwise, they may be estimated from tables in many engineering references (e.g., Chow, 1959, ASCE-WPCF, 1969) as a function of the construction material and sewer conditions. The value may be adjusted to account for losses not considered in the routing procedure (e.g., head losses in manholes or other structures, roots, obstructions). However, the flow routing is relatively insensitive to small changes in Manning's n.**

**<u>Description of Non-Conduits</u> -- The sewer system consists of many different structures, each with its own hydraulic properties. Elements 16 through 22 are designed to simulate such structures. Data requirements for these ele­ments are given in Table 6-3. Brief descriptions of these elements follow.**

**<u>Manholes (NTYPE = 16)</u> -- No physical data are required for manholes except their numbers and upstream element numbers. Note that the number of upstream elements is limited to three. If more than three branches of the system should join at a point, two manholes could be placed in series, allowing a total of five branches to joint at that point, etc. Flow routing is accom­plished in manholes by specifying that the outflow equals the sum of the inflows.**

**As an alternative to the use of the more detailed infiltration (INFIL) and dry-weather flow (FILTH) routines described later, flow and quality con­stituents may be input at manholes to simulate baseflow conditions. This input is constant over time and is allowed only at manholes and at no other element types.**

**<u>Lift Stations (NTYPE = 17)</u> -- The data requirements for lift stations are given in Table 6-3. It is assumed that the force main will remain full when the pump is not operating, resulting in no time delay in the flow routing (i.e., no time is required to fill the force main when the pump starts). When the volume of sewage in the wet** well reaches its specified capacity, the pumps begin to operate at a constant rate. This continues until the wet well volume equals zero. (Two-stage pumping may be simulated using a storage element.)

<u>Flow Dividers (NTYPE = 18 **and 21)**</u> **-- The routing procedure through these elements is explained in the discussion below. Typical** uses are given below.

1)  Simple diversion structure - A type 18 flow divider may be used to model a diversion structure in which none of the **flow is diverted until it reaches** a specified value (GEOM1). When the inflow is above this value, the non-diverted flow (QO1) remains constant at its capacity, GEOM1, and the surplus flow (Q02) is diverted.

2)  Cunnette section - A type 21 flow divider may be used to model a downstream cunnette section. The cunnette section is considered as a separate circular conduit to be placed parallel to the primary conduit as shown in Figure **6-5.** In order to model the cunnette as a semi-circle, the sep­arate circular conduit is given a diameter (GEOM1) so that

> **its area will be twice that of the actual total cunnette flow area. (The distance, slope and roughness will be the same as for the primary conduit.) A type 21 flow divider is then the upstream element common to both conduits, as shown in Figure 6-5. (The program assigns a value of GEOM1 of the flow divider equal to half the full flow capacity of the circular pipe simulating the cunnette so that it has the hydraulic characteristics of a semi-circle.) Any flow higher than GEOM1 will be diverted to the primary con­duit. Note that the parameter GEOM3 of the flow divider will be the element number assigned to the cunnette sec­tion. Note further that the element downstream from the two parallel conduits must list them both as upstream ele­ments.**
>
> **3) Overbank flow - A type 18 flow divider can be used to simulate flow into a main channel (undiverted flow) and into a parallel overbank channel for simulation of flooded conditions. Parameter GEOM1 would be set equal to the main channel capacity.** The channels could he of any **shape although two trapezoidal channels might be most appropriate for many natural configurations.**

**<u>Routing at Flow Dividers (NTYPE = 18 and 21)</u> -- Both types will divide the in­flow, QI, into two outflows, QO1 and Q02. The divider then acts as follows:**

> For 0 5 QI ≤ GEOM1, Q01 = QI
>
> Q02 = 0.0
>
> **(6-2)**
>
> **For GEOM1 QI, QO1 = GEOM1**
>
> **Q02 = QI - GEOM1**

**The undiverted outflow, QO1, will flow into the downstream element denoted by GEOM3. (The element into which Q02 flows does not need to be specified).**

**<u>Flow Divider (NTYPE = 20)</u> -- This element is used to model a weir-type diver­sion strucutre in which a linear relationship can adequately relate the flow rate and the depth of flow into the weir structure. Input parameters are de­fined in Table 6-3. The weir constant, incorporated into the variable ,ROUGH, can be varied to account for the type of weir. Typical values of the weir con­stant are 3.3 for a broad crested weir and 4.1 for a side weir.**

**The flow divider behaves as a function of the inflow, QI, as follows:**

> **For Q S QI S DIST, QO1 = QI**
>
> **Q02 = 0.0** (6-3)
>
> **For DIST ≤ QI, QO1 and Q02 are computed as follows:**

3)  Compute the undiverted flow:  
    > QO1 = QI - Q02

> <u>Storage Unit (NTYPE 19)</u> -- This element is specified only when internal storage computations are required. Internal storage is modeled in a manner similar to the detention unit of the Storage/Treatment Block. (See Section 7 and Appendix IV.) Internal storage is modeled as a completely-mixed unit with a variety of outlet structures. However, as opposed to the detention unit in the S/T Block, pollutant removal is not simulated other than by decay. The storage unit must be described on card groups G1 to GS.
>
> A storage unit may be placed anywhere in the sewer system where appreci­able storage may exist, such as at an outflow or diversion structure. The required data inputs are described later. It should be noted that the stor­age area or "reservoir" may consist of a portion of the sewer system itself, and area-depth relationships must be worked out accordingly.
>
> <u>Backwater Element (NTYPE = 22)</u> -- This element may be used to model backwater conditions in a series of conduits due to a flow control structure downstream. The situation is modeled in a manner analogous to reservoir flood routing as follows:

1)  A storage element (NTYPE 19) is placed at the location of the control structure. The type of storage element will depend upon the structure (e.g., weir, orifice). One inflow to this storage element is then from the conduit just upstream.

2)  If the water surface is extended horizontally upstream

> from the flow control structure at the time of maximum
>
> depth at the structure, it will intersect the invert slope of the sewer at a point corresponding to the assumed maxi­mum length of backwater. The reach between this point and the structure may encompass several conduit lengths. A
>
> backwater element (NTYPE 22) is placed at this point of
>
> maximum backwater, in place of a manhole, **for instance.**

3)  The backwater element then diverts flow directly into the storage element depending upon the volume of water (and hence, the length of backwater) in the storage element. If the backwater extends all the way to the backwater ele­ment, the total flow is diverted to the storage element; none is diverted to the conduits.

4)  The amount of diverted flow (QO1) is assumed directly pro­portional to the length of the backwater. The storage area in reality consists of the conduits. Since most conduits

> 239 6-20
>
> can be assumed to have a constant width, on the average, the backwater length is assumed proportional to the square root of the current storage volume, obtained from the storage routine.

3)  The parameter GEOM3 of the backwater element must contain the element number of the downstream storage unit.

4)  Parameters for the storage element are read in as usual. Note that the depth-area values will correspond to the storage area of the upstream conduits. Note also that the storage unit must list the backwater element as one of its upstream elements, as well as the conduit immediately upstream.

5)  At each time step, the backwater element computes the ratio of current to maximum storage volume in the downstream storage element. Call this ratio r. Then

> QO 1 = QI
>
> and (6-4)  
> Q02 = OI - Q01

> <u>Step 3. Input Data and Computational Controls</u> --
>
> <u>Options</u> -- The basic input data, hydrographs and pollutographs are generated outside of the Transport Block. However, certain operational controls are available within Transport.
>
> <u>Choice of Time Step (DT)</u> -- The size of the time step must be an integer multiple or integer fraction of the time step used in the preceding block. In tests of sensitivity (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a), it was found that except for very small values of DT (10 seconds), the output from Transport is insensitive to the length of the time step. Between values of two minutes and 30 minutes, hydrograph ordinates varied by less than one per­cent. For extremely short time step values, the peak flow moved downstream faster and never attained the maximum value that it had with a DT of two minutes and longer. Within the range commonly needed by SWMM users (two minutes to 30 minutes), the choice of time step will not significantly affect results. However, continuity errors can occasionally arise if the time step is "appreciably" longer than the travel time through any conduit. "Appreciably" longer means about factor of two.
>
> <u>Choice of Number of Time Steps (NDT)</u> -- The number of time steps is not restricted. The program will use the number input in Transport (NDT) or the number used by the preceding block, whichever gives the shorter simulation time.
>
> 240 6-21
>
> **<u>Choice of Number of Iterations (NITER)</u> -- The purpose of iterations in the computations is to eliminate flow oscillations in the output. The flatter pipe slopes (less than 0.001 ft/ft) require iterations of the flow routing portion of the Transport Model to help dampen these oscillations. Four iterations have proven to be sufficient in most cases.**
>
> **<u>Choice of Allowable Convergence Error (EPSIL)</u> -- Convergence of the flow routing procedure should not be any problem, and -the default value of EPSIL, 0.0001, may be used. It will provide sufficient accuracy and result in only a very minimal increase in computer time over larger values. The only conver­gence problems that may exist can occur when flow enters a dry conduit. For instance, this could occur at the beginning of a storm in a sewer with little or no base flow. Messages to this effect will be printed if parameter NPRINT**
>
> **0. These may almost always be ignored since the default options in subrou­tine ROUTE will continue program execution and only result in a very small error in continuity (a fraction of a percent).**
>
> **<u>Alternate Hydrograph and Pollutograph Inputs</u> -- Hydrograph and pollutographs may be entered from a tape/disk file (e.g., as generated in the Runoff Block) and/or entered from cards, using card groups Il and R1 in Table 6-6. Param­eters NCNTRL and NINPUT are set accordingly. Note that input from both cards and tape/disk may be performed simultaneously. If, for some reason, input from cards is not desired, a tape/disk file containing the specified input values could be created and specified as an input file to Transport in place of, say, a file generated by the Runoff Block. The format of such a file is described in Section 2.**

Although these would often be chosen from the group (up to ten) supplied by the Runoff Block (or another preceding block), they do not have to he since card input may be used in addition to the interface file. If the same pollutant is entered from both the interface file and from cards, the description (name, name of units, type of units) from the inter­face file must he used. If the pollutant is entered only from cards, this description must be supplied on card group Fl. Further information on pollutant description is contained in Section 4.**

**241 6-22**

> <u>Routing</u> --
>
> Routing of quality parameters is performed by using the integral solu­tion for the output from a completely mixed conduit volume (Medina et al., 1981). See Appendix IX for a derivation. Although this tends to introduce artificial dispersion of concentration profiles, it is the most convenient way in which to introduce new loadings at manholes along the system, as well as to facilitate scour and deposition calculations. The quality routing procedure is not subject to calibration directly. However, the routing becomes closer to pure advection (plug flow) as the number of elements is increased.
>
> <u>Scour and Deposition</u> --
>
> The basis for these procedures is described in Appendix VI. Each pollutant is assigned a specific gravity (SPG) and particle size distri­bution, assumed to apply throughout the drainage system regardless of the source of the pollutant, e.g., stormwater or dry-weather flow. If the specific gravity is less than or equal to 1.0, the pollutant is considered to be entirely suspended (or dissolved) and not subject to scour and deposition. If all calibration is to be performed using Runoff Block buildup-washoff parameters, for instance, it may be desirable to avoid the complexity of simulating a second real but largely unknown source.
>
> Typical particle size distributions (and interpretation of input param­eters PSIZE and PGR) are illustrated in Figure 6-6. Such information should be collected first hand at each catchment; secondary sources such as Sartor and Boyd (1972), Shaheen (1975), Manning et al. (1977) and Pisano et al. (1979) should be used only if local data are not available. During the simu­lation scour and deposition are simulated using Shield's criterion to deter­mine the critical diameter for incipient motion and deposition (see Appendix VI). The kinematic velocity of water (GNU on Card D2) is a function of temperature and used to calculate the boundary Reynolds number on Shield's diagram (Graf, 1971, Vanoni, 1975). For each conduit, the critical diameter is determined as a function of velocity, roughness and specific gravity. At the same time, the maximum diameter of the <u>suspended</u> fraction and the <u>minimum</u> diameter of the <u>settled</u> fraction is maintained. If the critical diameter is less than the maximum of the suspended material, more is settled; the settled mass is determined by multiplying by a fraction determined from the particle size distribution (Appendix VI). Similarly, if the critical diameter is greater than the minimum of the settled material, more is suspended. The settled material is thus assumed to have the particle size distribution of the right hand tail of the total distribution (Figure 6-6), and the sus­pended material has the distribution of the left hand side.
>
> Decreasing the specific gravity (downwards toward 1.0) increases the amount suspended and vice versa. As SPG approaches 1.0 closely the proce­dure becomes very sensitive to SPG since there is a division by SPG-1.0. Typical values of specific gravities of particulate matter in sewers range from 1.1 for volatile material to 2.7 for sand and grit. The actual situa­tion in which each particle size range may have its own specific gravity can be handled by the Storage/Treatment Block, but not the Transport Block

> (except that up to four different pollutants may be simulated). Since it is only one parameter, calibration of the scour-deposition routine may be most easily calibrated using SPG. Alternatively, a greater percentage of large diameter material may be assigned a pollutant using the particle size distribution if, for instance, more deposition were desired.
>
> Unlike the previous Transport Model, continuity of pollutant mass is now maintained during scour and deposition. In addition, larger particles can settle upstream in flat conduits and be unavailable for downstream settling. An initial settled mass in each conduit is computed prior to the start of the simulation by running the routine for DWDAYS days (card D2) prior to the storm event (or longer) simulation. This initial deposition is assumed to start with a clean bed.
>
> Although this scour-deposition routine is a far cry from the detailed sewer sediment transport program developed by Sonnen (1977), it is reason­ably simple, consistent and may be calibrated. And should the user desire, it may be bypassed (using SPG.51.0), and all quality calibration performed in the Runoff Block.

In fact, however, the user has most of the responsibility for infiltration estimation, optionally using techniques described below. The program does little more than apportion it properly.
>
> For the purposes of analysis, infiltration is classified into four categories, i.e., miscellaneous sources causing a base dry weather inflow, frozen residual moisture, antecedent precipitation, and high groundwater. The cumulative effects of the first three sources can be seen in Figure 6-8 which excludes surface runoff. Figure 6-8 shows total infiltration QINF as the sum of dry weather infiltration DINFIL, wet weather infiltration RINFIL, and melting residual ice and frost infiltration SINFIL. However, in cases where the groundwater table rises about the sewer invert, it is assumed that groundwater inflow GINFIL alone will be the dominant source of infiltration. Thus, infiltration is defined as:
>
> DINFIL + RINFIL + SINFIL
>
> QINF = or (6-5)

> GINFIL for high groundwater table

**Infiltration - inflow studies (e.g., EPA, 1975) have been performed in many cities and should provide much of the needed data.**

**<u>Dry Weather Infiltration (DINFIL)</u>** --

**If the study area under consideration has been gaged, base dry-weather infiltration can be taken by inspection from the flow data. In the absence of flow data, an estimate of the unit infiltration rate XLOCAL (gpm/inch-diameter per mile) for dry weather must be obtained from local professionals. From data in the form of calculated values of DIAM and PLEN, Equation 6-6 can then be used to determine DINFIL (gpm):**

> **DINFIL = XLOCAL•DIAM•PLEN (6-6)**
>
> **where DI A".', = average sewer diamater, in., and  
> PLEN = pipe length, mi.**

**Values of XLOCAL range from 250 to 600 gpm/in-diameter per day (ASCE-WPCF, 1969) and may be even higher for laterals with many stubs and wyes. The importance of local data cannot be over-emphasized.**

<u>Residual Meltin€; Ice and Frost Infiltration (SINFIL)</u>

SINFIL arises from residual precipitation such as snow as it melts fol­lowing cold periods. Published data (American Soc. of Heating and Air Condi­tioning Engineers) in the form of monthly degree days (sum of **deviations below 65°F) provide an excellent index as to the significance of SINFIL. Average monthly degree-days for cities in the United States are reproduced in Appendix VIII. The onset and duration of melting can be estimated by noting the degree days NDD above and immediately below a value of 750. Refer to Figure 6-9 for the following description.**

**Within subroutine INFIL, the beginning of melting, MLTBE, is taken as the day on which NDD drops below 750. Next, MLTEN is determined so that *A<sub>l</sub>* equals A<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that the melting rate is sinusoidal. The maximum contribution RSMAX from residual moisture can be determined from previous gaging of the study area or local estimates. In either case, SINFIL is determined within the program by the following equation:**

**RSMAX•sin\[180•(NDYUD-MLTBE)/(MLTEN-MLTBE)\]**

> RINFIL depends upon antecedent precipitation occurring within nine days prior to an estimate. If antecedent rainfall is unavailable or less than about 0.25 in (6.4 mm), the RINFIL contribution to QINFIL is usually small. For larger antecedent rainfall contributions, regression techniques offer one method of estimating RINFIL. For example, during development of the infiltration routine, available rainfall and infiltration data were examined (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). For three areas in which sewer flow data were not affected by melting, RINFIL was found to satisfy the following linear relationship:
>

For example, a regression analysis could involve determination of the BETA coefficients in Equation 6-9, or an alternative formulation could be investigated.

**<u>Apportionment of Infiltration</u> --**

**Once an estimate of the total local infiltration QINF has been obtained, this flow must be apportioned throughout the designated study area. The cri­terion chosen for apportionment is an opportunity factor OPINF which repre­sents the relative number and length of openings susceptible to infiltration. Pipe joints constitute the primary avenue for entry of infiltration (Geyer and Lentz, 1963). The number and length of joints is assumed to be propor­tional to the relative surface area of each conduit. For each, an equivalent circular pipe diameter will be proportional to the square root of its known cross sectional area, ft. Then the fraction of total infiltration ("oppor­tunity"** for infiltration) allocated to each conduit, OPINF, is:

**and the summation in the denominator is over all conduits. Trapezoidal chan­nels are treated the same as all others. The apportioned infiltration enters the system at the non-conduit element immediately upstream of the conduit.**

**This procedure allocates the most infiltration to the largest and long­est conduits. Should local information dictate otherwise, infiltration may be apportioned by the user and entered at appropriate manholes in card group El.**

>
> <u>Data Needs</u> --
>
> <u>Hydrologic Data</u> -- Concurrent historical rainfall, water table, and sewer flow data of several weeks' duration are needed to completely describe infil­tration. In addition, rainfall for several days prior to the flow estimate is required for use in a regression equation for RINFIL. Of course, such data would be required for many different storms for development of such an equation.
>
> Ideally, the rainfall record would be from a rain gage which is located near the center of the study area and which records daily rainfall in inches. If more than one rain gage is located within the study area, daily measure­ments from all gages should be averaged. Missing data (e.g., from a malfunc­tioning gage) or a total absence of measurements due to no gaging within the study area can sometimes be overcome with measurements taken from a rain gage located within a few miles. If National Weather Service (NWS) Climatological Data recorded at the nearest airport or federal installation are not avail­able, contact the National Weather Records Center (Asheville, NC) for assistance.
>
> Should some other form of precipitation, e.g., snowfall, be encountered, it will *be* necessary to convert this to equivalent rainfall. If estimates are unavailable from the NWS, the ratio of ten inches of snow to one inch of rain may be used.
>
> Water table data should also be obtained from gaging within the study area. However, shallow-well data from the US Geological, Survey or state geological office can be used to supplement missing data. Water table ele­vations are not required if they are below the sewer inverts for the day on which QINF is to be estimated.
>
> <u>Sewer Data</u> -- Sewer flow data for regression analysis should be taken from a gage located at the downstream point within the study area. Upstream gag­ing may sometimes be used to estimate flows at the downstream point by simply adjusting flows based upon respective surface area. Physical sewer data (e.g., lengths, diameters) are taken from prior input used within TRANS to route sewer flow.

<u>Step 1. Determine Groundwater Condition</u> - If the groundwater table is pre­dominantly above the sewer invert, all infiltration is attributed to this source (GINFIL). In this case, an estimate of Lhe LuLal infiltration is made directly (i.n cfs for the total drainage basin) and read in card Kl. This card followed by a blank card (card K2) would complete the infiltration data input. If the groundwater table is not predominantly above the sewer invert, proceed to Step 2.

<u>Step 2. Build-Up Infiltration from Base Estimates</u> -- From measurements, historical data, or judgment, provide estimates of DINFIL and RINFIL. In this case, GINF1L must be set equal to 0.0. Finally, if needed, provide the peak residual moisture (RSMAX), and the 12 monthly degree-day totals taken from Appendix VII or a local source.

<u>Pry Weather Flow Model  
Methodology</u> --

Subroutine FILTH has been developed as an option to estimate average sewage flow and quality from residential, commercial, and industrial urban areas. FILTH estimates sewage inputs at discrete locations along the trunk sewers of any specified urban drainage basin. These estimates are calculated from data describing drainage basin subsections (subcatchments and subareas) under which the trunk sewer passes. In this routine, dry-weather flow quan­tity and quality are developed from regression equations, as explained in the documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). The estimates are for three <u>specific</u> quality parameters: BOD<sub>5</sub>, suspended solids (SS) and total coliforms. Thus, if any different parameters are to be simulated, FILTH cannot be used. However, if a fourth parameter is to be routed in addition to BOD<sub>5,</sub> SS and total coliforms, FILTH can be used to provide estimates for the first three but not the additional one. Also bear in mind that a con­stant base flow for any parameter may be input at manholes in card group El.

When FILTH is not used, DWF estimates may be input at desired manholes, as discussed previously. In fact, this; option may *be* routinely used in place of FILTH whenever reasonable estimates are available for instream DWF quan­tity and quality.

An example of a hypothetical sewer system and input situation for FILTH is given in Figure 6-10. To avoid confusion with Runoff Block subcatchments, all drainage basin subdivisions will be referred to as subareas in the fol­lowing discussion. As shown in the figure, an input manhole near the center of each subarea is assumed to accept all sewage flow from that subarea. Criteria for establishing subarea boundaries and input locations are dis­cussed later in the text.

> **In the context of the SWMM, FILTH calculates daily sewage flow (cfs) and characteristics (BOD<sub>c</sub>, SS, and total coliforms) averaged over the entire year for each subarea. FILTH is called from subroutine TRANS by setting the parameter NFILTH equal to one. Flow and quality characteristics estimates and corresponding manhole input numbers are then returned to TRANS where the estimates undergo adjustment depending upon the day of the week and hour of the day during which simulation is proceeding.**
>
> **The subroutine may** *be* **omitted when modeling separate storm sewers unless it is desired to generate a base flow with DWF characteristics. FILTH is designed to handle an unrestricted number of inlet areas and indi­vidual process flow contributors. As a safeguard against faulty data, how­ever, a program interrupt is provided if the combined number exceeds 159, which is a limit set by the Transport Model.**
>
> **<u>Quantity Estimates</u> --**
>
> **Three data categories are used to estimate sewage flow: (1) drainage basin data, (2) subarea data, and (3) decision and adjustment parameters.**
>
> **Study area data are TOTA, KTNUM and ADWF. KTNUM denotes the number of subareas into which a drainage basin, having a surface area TOTA (acres), is being divided. ADWF, which is optional depending upon its availability, gives the average sewage flow (cfs) originating from the entire drainage basin (e.g., average flow data from a treatment plant serving the study area). When it is included, the predicted basin flow will be adjusted to match this value.**
>
> **Subarea data requirements consist of several options depending upon availability and choice of input. Discussion later in the text will assist in data tabulation by noting the order of preference where options exist.

>
> 1\) **<u>Identification parameters</u> -- Identification parameters are KNUM, INPUT, and KLAND. KNUM identifies each subarea by a number less than or equal to KTNUM. For each of the KTNUM subareas, INPUT indicates the number of the manhole into which DWF is assumed to enter. Land use within each sub­area which approximately corresponds to zoning classifica­tion, is categorized according to Table 6-5. KLAND serves as an important factor in deciding subarea locations and sizes. Figure 6-10 will assist in describing how the above data are determined and tabulated.**

2)  <u>Flow</u> data.-•- Flow data are optional inputs that eliminate the need for using predictive equations. Two possible types of flow data are average sewage flow measurements, SEWAGE, and metered water use, WATER. Commercial or industrial sewage flow or water use measurements should be input using the variable SAQPF. Flows from commercial and in­dustrial establishments located in residential or open subareas may be included using SAQPF, also. Metering at lift stations and other flow control structures within the study area is occasionally available and should be used whenever possible. Metered water use offers a more available source of subarea flow data. Unfortunately, considerable effort in locating, tabulating, and aver­aging these data is often required.

3)  <u>Estimating data</u> -- For each subarea where SEWAGE or WATER measurements are not available estimated water use must be used as an estimate of sewage flow. In the case of a fac­tory or commercial establishment, estimates can be made by multiplying the number of employees by an established co­efficient (gpd per employee). In the case of a large fac­tory or commercial establishment, one subarea may be estab­lished with estimated water use tabulated as SAQPF for that subarea. On the other hand, estimates of water use for established non-residential areas (e.g., industrial parks or shopping centers) may be summed and tabulated as SAQPF for one large subarea. A list of the above mentioned co­efficients is given in Appendix VIII.

> In the case of residential areas, estimating data for each subarea are METHOD, PRICE, ASUB, POPDEN, DWLINGS, FAMILY, and VALUE. Default values and definitions of each of these are given in the description of input data. Decision and adjustment parameters consist of DVDWF, HVDWF, KDAY, CPI, and
>
> 256 6-37

CCCI\. DVDWF and HVDWF are daily and hourly correction factors, respectively, for DWF. DVDWF is comprised of seven numbers that are ratios of daily aver­age sewage flows to weekly average flow. Likewise, HVDWF is comprised of 24 numbers that are ratios of hourly average sewage flows to daily average flow. Both groups of 'numbers may be derived from observed flow variation patterns throughout the country (e.g., Tucker, 1967, Portland Cement Association, 1968). Their use is to correct measured or estimated average sewage flow Lu more accurate eatimates depending upon the day and hour. Typical sewage flow variations are shown in Figures 6-11 and 6-12. These flow patterns are only examples; locally observed patterns more accurately describe local variations and should be used when available.

KDAY denotes the day of the week at which simulation is to begin. As the simulation proceeds, this value is continually updated. By using the current day and hour, the appropriate values of DVDWF and HVDWF can be multiplied by average flow to determine the correct value. KDAY ranges from 1 to 7 with Sunday being day number 1.

Two cost indices are employed to adjust current house valuations and water prices to appropriate 1960 values and 1963 prices, respectively. This is done because estimating equations within FILTH are based upon 1960 values and 1963 prices. CPI, consumer price index, has been chosen to adjust water price by multiplying water price by 1960 CPI divided by the current CPI. CCCI, composite construction cost index, has been chosen to adjust house valuations similarly. Both indices can be found in most libraries in jour­nals on economic affairs (e.g., U.S. Dept. of Commerce, <u>Survey of Current Business and Statistical Abstracts of the United States).</u>

<u>Quality Estimates</u> --

The purpose of the DWF quality computation is to apportion waste charac­teristics (such as would be measured at a sewage treatment plant before treatment) among the various subareas in the drainage basin under study, or in the event no measured data are available, to estimate and apportion usable average values. The apportionment is based upon the flow distribution, land use, measured or estimated industrial flows, average family income, the use or absence of garbage grinders, and infiltration.

Daily and hourly correction factors for concentrations of BOD, SS and total coliforms are input in conjunction with those for flow variations. All are expressed as ratios of instantaneous to annual or daily averages.

Card Ni includes the total number of subareas and process flow sources to be processed along with the type case (whether the total DWF character­istics are known or to ***be*** estimated), the number of process flow contribu­tors, the cost indices, and the total drainage basin population. Depending upon the instructions given, computations proceed along the Case 1 or Case 2 channel.

> <u>Case</u> 1 -- In this instance, the total DWF quality charac­teristics are known at a point well downstream in the sys­tem. These characteristics may be obtained from treatment

Dry-weather flow quality starts with the average BOD<sub>5</sub> and SS concentra­tions (A1BOD and A1SS) previously computed for the entire subarea. These are used for the concentrations of non-process flows for all subareas, with two exceptions. First, for commercial and industrial areas, the average concentrations are multiplied by 0.9. Second, the strengths of residential flows are adjusted according to average family income, XINCOM, and percent garbage grinders, PCGG, as explained in the documentation.

The process flow load (i.e. flow times concentration) is then added to the loads just computed, for all land uses. For non-residential land use process flows could constitute the only quality loads.

Finally, for all subareas, total coliforms are computed solely on the basis of population using the average concentration, AlCOLI, computed earlier along with the total basin populations, POPULA, (card N1) and subarea popula­tions computed from POPDEN (card Q1). Thus, there will be a subarea contri­bution of total coliforms only if POPDEN \$ O.

For each of the KTNUM subareas, subtotals (cumulative up to this sub­area) of computed flows and quality will he printed for each subarea if MSUBT \$ 1. Otherwise, only basin totals will be printed. If measured basin averages have been input on card 01 (KASE = 1) all subarea loads are adjusted by a constant ratio such that the flow and concentrations computed from the data of card group Q1 will agree with the input averages.

<u>Summary of Dry Weather Flow Requirements</u> --

<u>Step 1. Establishing Subareas</u> -- Establishment of the subareas constitutes the initial step in applying subroutine FILTH. Both detail of input data and assumptions made in developing FILTH imply constraints on the type, size, and number of subareas. However, most important in subarea establishment is the type of estimating data available and the maintenance of homogenous land use.

Subareas should be located and sized to utilize existing sewer flow measurements taken within the drainage basin. These measurements should be recent and of sufficient duration to provide a current average sewage flow value for the period of time during which simulation is to proceed. Measured daily and hourly flow variation should be used in lieu of generalized values described earlier in the text. A gaging site with less than 200 ac (81 ha) contributing flow often provides a convenient data input situation. A sub­area should be established upstream from the gage with average sewage flow tabulated as SEWAGE for that subarea. It is convenient, though not neces­sary, for the subareas to correspond to subcatchments in Runoff.

If metered water use is to be used to estimate sewage flow, subareas should be located to coincide with meter reading zones or other zones used by the water department that simplify data takeoff. Since water use would be used to estimate sewage flow, average winter readings should be used to minimize the effects of lawn sprinkling and other summer uses.

> 261 6-42
>
> If neither gaging nor metered water use are input, sewage characteris­tics must be estimated. Subareas should then be established to yield apprO-priate input data for the residential estimating equations in FILTH. Zero sewage flow is assumed from commercial, industrial, and parkland subareas for which SEWAGE and WATER are zero and measurements of SAQPF are not given. Since KLAND and VALUE are the significant variables in estimating subarea sewage flow, subareas should be located and sized to include land with uni•-form land use and property valuation. To utilize es-sting census data, sub­area boundaries should *be made* to coincide with census tract boundaries.
>
> Criteria for establishing subareas are listed in the following summary:
>
> 1\) Subareas in general should:

1.  be of homogenous land use;

2.  be less than or equal to 159 in number; and

3.  conform to the branched pipe network.

> 2\) Subareas should be established to employ any existing sewer flow measurements.
>
> 3\) Subareas for which metered water use is used to estimate sewage flow should be compatible with meter reading zones.
>
> 4\) Residential subareas for which estimated water use is used to estimate sewage flow should:

1.  be uniform with respect to land use;

2.  be uniform with respect to dwelling unit  
    > valuation; and

3.  coincide with census tracts.

> <u>Step 2. Collection of Data</u> -- Other than the establishment of measured data described earlier, the primary data source is the US Bureau of Census for census tract information. This source provides readily available data on population distribution, family income, and the number and relative age of dwelling units. City records, aerial photographs, and on-site inspection may be necessary to define land use activities, process flow, and dwelling density variations within tracts.
>
> <u>Step 3. Data Tabulation</u> -- Once subareas have been established, several alternatives exist regarding data tabulation. An identification number KNUM should be given to each subarea prior to data takeoff. However, once KNUM's have been established, corresponding INPUT manhole numbers are selected from a previously numbered schematic diagram of the trunk sewer. This numbered schematic serves as the mechanism to coordinate runoff, infiltration, and sewage inputs. Refer to the Transport discussion for additional information about the numbered schematic. If water use estimates are necessary, land

> **use should be dt!termined from city zoning maps and the previously tabulated values for KLAND.**
>
> **ADWF should be tabulated as average drainage basin sewage flow. As the ADWF, SEWAGE should be averaged from flow data for the appropriate month, season, or year. ADWF, SAQPF, or SEWAGE may be obtained from routine or specific gaging programs done by the city, consulting engineers, or other** agencies. SAQPF may **be estimated for commercial and industrial areas** using **water use coefficients (Appendix VIII). Also, SAQPF and WATER may be deter­mined for all land use categories from water meter records.**
>
> **<u>Initialization</u>**
>
> **Following execution of subroutines INFIL and/or FILTH, flows and con­centrations will be initialized to base flow values simply by summing flows and loads at all junctions (non-conduits) in subroutine INITAL. Base flow can thus originate from three sources: input at manholes, infiltration (sub­routine INFIL), and/or dry-weather flow (subroutine FILTH). Inflows from FILTH are always subject to the hourly and daily adjustment factors; inflows from INFIL and manholes are not.**
>
> **In addition, the buildup of settled pollutant fractions (if simulated) in the sewer system is estimated using subroutine DWLOAD. For the particle size distribution and specific gravity discussed earlier, daily "solids" deposition is computed for DWDAYS dry-weather days (card D2) prior to the simulation. The initial pounds of deposition are printed for each conduit. This material is then eligible for erosion during the simulation (computed in subroutine QUAL). Thus, if flows increase over their initial values, (as expected during a storm) a "first flush" will be provided.**

**Footnotes to Table 6-6**

1.  **A/A = ANORM is the cross-sectional flow area divided by the cross-sectional flow area of the pipe running full. Tabular values of ANORM are generated in the program by dividing the ANORM axis (0.0 1.0) into NN1 or MM1 equal divisions.**

2.  **Q/Q<sub>f</sub> = QNORM is the flow rate divided by the flow rate of the conduit flowing full.**

3.  **y/y = DNORM is the depth of flow, y, divided by the maximum flow depth, y<sub>f</sub> (e.g., diameter of a circular conduit).**

4.  **Repeated cards have same format, i.e., 2X, F8.0, 7F10.0.**

5.  **The title from the first of any preceding blocks run will also be printed.**

6.  **The** Transport Block time step doe:; not have to equal that of a preced­ing block. The total simulation time is NDT • DT. If this is greater than that of an input file, the simulation will end earlier. Although there is no limit on the simulation time (number of time steps), output is geared toward single events only. That is, daily or monthly totals are not printed, and zeroes are not suppressed. Hence, output is inconvenient for continuous simulation, although the Transport Block can be run that way.

<!-- -->

61. Inlet hydrographs from a preceding block will automatically be accepted, but a match must be found for each inlet (element) number on the inter­face file with an element number entered in Transport.

62. These locations should include any elements for which graphical output is desired since only locations on the interface file may be plotted using the Executive Block.

63. Except in unusual cases, these errors will only indicate that a small continuity violation will occur. These errors can usually be cured by shortening the time step or increasing the length of the conduit.

64. If the time step for Transport is different than that for a preceding block, input hydrograph and pollutograph ordinates will be found by linear interpolation at the required time.

65. If both card and interface file input is used, hydrographs and polluto-graph loads entered at common locations will be summed. Transport can be run without card hydrograph input if it were desired to route only dry-weather flows (base flows).

66. Constant base flows and concentrations may be entered at manhole ele­ments (Type 16) in card group El if desired, thus eliminating the need to call FILTH or INFIL. They may still be called if desired;

> **289 6-70**
>
> **infiltration, dry-weather flow and base flow will be summed for entry at non-conduits. Base flows and concentrations entered in card group El will not be subject to daily and hourly correction factors.**

67. **"External" numbers are those assigned by the user to the various sewer system components. "Internal" numbers are assigned within the program in the order in which elements in card group El are read in. All input to the Transport Model is in** terms of external numbers.

68. **Input values on this card indicated with asterisks are multiplied by ratios, initially set equal to 1.0. If the element number = 1, non­zero data entries for parameters with asterisks will replace old values of the ratios. Ratios may be altered or reset to 1.0 any number of times. The intention of the use of ratios is to simplify sensitivity analyses, etc., by allowing easy changes of data values without repunching data cards. The altered ratios apply to all subsequent input cards (until changed by another ratio card).**

69. **Input parameters on this card indicated with asterisks will take on** default values if input, values are zero. **Tf** the element numbet'= 2, **non-zero data entries for parameters with asterisks will become new default values for all future entries of these parameters. Default values may be altered or reset to their original values (except zero) any number of times. It is not possible to reset a default value exactly torero since only non-zero values are changed. However, the value may be made arbitrarily small by u8ing E-format data entries.**

> **For example, 0.10E-50 will be read as 10 in an F8.3 format.** The altered default values apply to all subsequent input cards (until changed by another default value card).

70. For example, a two-barrelled conduit would consist of two identical parallel conduits adjacent to each other, as in a double box culvert.

71. If NFILTH .= 1 (card D3) it will be assumed that the first pollutant is BOD<sub>5,</sub> the second is suspended solids and the third is total coliforms. Hence, the selection indicated by NPOL must be in this order. The fourth pollutant, if simulated, is unaffected by the value of NFILTH.

72. See the discussion in the Runoff Block.

73. Up to the five available points (including 0.0 mm, 100%) may be used to define the particle size distribution. For instance, if a triangular distribution were satisfactory with 0.1 mm being the largest particle size, then PSIZE(2) = 0.1, PGR(2) = 0.0 would be the only entries needed.

74. May require multiple cards.

75. Be careful in subsequent blocks to ensure that element numbers will correspond to those transferred in interface file. However, any ele­ment number may be placed on the interface file, e.g., for plotting purposes.

> 290 6-71

76. See Table VIII-1, Appendix VIII, for representative values. Degree-days are not needed if RSMAX = 0.0 on card Kl, (but a blank card must still be included for card K2). Degree days are in °F-day and there is no metric input for this parameter.

77. When subroutine FILTH is used to generate dry-weather flow and pollu­tants, the only pollutants included are BOD<sub>5,</sub> suspended solids (SS) and total coliforms (T.C.). NPOLL must be 3 or 4, and the three pollutants entered in the given order in card group Fl. The fourth pollutant is arbitrary (if used) and is not affected by FILTH calculations.

78. Predicted total average daily dry-weather flow from downstream end(s) of system will be adjusted to these values.

79. If process flows are too large it is possible for ADWF - infiltration ZQPF \< 0 in which case the program defaults to KASE = 2.

80. Either-SEWAGE or else WATER is required to generate dry-weather flow from commercial areas. If both are zero, only process flows will be considered. SEWAGE and WATER should = 0 for industrial land use; for KLAND = 4, let entire flow be process flow.

81. DWLNGS and FAMILY can be used to calculate the population and then the population density. If both are given, the value of POPDEN will be overridden.

82. These industrial process flows described by SAQPF, SABPF and SASPF will be added to flows and quality already generated.

83. The program will interpolate linearly between entries of TE2 to obtain intermediate values of flow and concentrations. Hence, the difference between two time entries, TE2, should not be less than the time step, DT, unless a step function change is desired. Time entries need not be equally spaced, but the last time entered must extend past the end time of the run. Time TZERO is read from the interface file or else entered on card D2. If simulation extends beyond midnight (i.e., TE2 \> 24), continue the running time into the next day or days (i.e., let TE2 be greater than 24). Note, the time TE2 must be the same for all inlets. (The program will use the value for TE2 entered on the last inlet card.)

> STORAGE/TREATMENT BLOCK
>
> BLOCK DESCRIPTION  
> <u>Introduction</u>
>
> The Storage/Treatment Block has been developed to simulate the routing of flows and pollutants through a dry- or wet-weather storage/treatment plant containing up to five units or processes. The model will accept any number of time steps; therefore, a single-event or a continuous simulation is possible. Each unit may be modeled as having detention or non-detention characteristics.. The various units may be linked in a variety of configur­ations. Sludge handling may also be modeled using one or more units. Addi­tionally, capital cost and operation and maintenance cost may be estimated for each unit.
>
> The SIT Block will route, in addition to flow, up to three different pollutants. These pollutants may be input to the block from any external block via off-line storage, directly from cards, or a combination of both. Characterization of the pollutants may be by magnitude (i.e., concentration) or by magnitude and a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution. All input flows and pollutant concentrations are assumed to be instantanous values. However, the instantaneous values at the beginning and end of each time are used to compute average values for each time step. Thus, the user is cautioned that the output from the S/T Block consist of average values, not instantaneous values as in the rest of SWMM.
>
> This section describes the program operations of the S/T Block, pro­vides instructions for preparing input data cards, defines program vari­ables, and presents test applications. The user is referred to Appendix IV for theoretical development and explanations.
>
> <u>Program Operation</u>
>
> The Storage/Treatment Block is a FORTRAN program of approximately 2000 statements in length and consists of eight subroutines. The relationships among the S/T Block, the rest of SWMM and the various subroutines are shown in Figure 7-1.

> from the S/T Block transferred to other blocks is also handled by STRT (through the Executive Block). The information transferred to other blocks is discussed in the next paragraph. Subroutine STRDAT is called in STRT at the start of a run and is responsible for reading the input data describing the units, their configuration, the pollutant removal mechanisms, the method of characterizing pollutants and the remainder of the data provided by the user (excluding flow and pollutant inputs). STRDAT also prints the input data for verification. Subroutine CONTRL is called each time-step from the main driving loop in subroutine STRT. CONTRL directs flow and pollutants between units and any subsequent block. CONTRL also coordinates the account­ing and printout of detailed and summarized performance information. Flow and pollutant inputs from cards are also read in this subroutine. Sub­routine UNIT is called from subroutine CONTRL for each unit and is the heart of the S/T Block. UNIT has the flexibility and capability to model deten­tion and non-detention units with a variety of pollutant removal mechanisms, residual removal schemes and outflow structures. Subroutine EQUATE is used by UNIT to provide a variety of pollutant removal equations. Subroutine INTERP is employed by UNIT for linear interpolation in routing flows through detention units. Subroutine PLUGS is used by UNIT to model pollutant rout­ing through a detention unit when perfect plug flow is specified. <sup>-</sup>.Subroutine STCOST is called from STRT to estimate the capital cost and operation and maintenance cost for each unit.
>
> <u>Use of Off-line Computer Storage</u>
>
> No scratch data sets are required to run the Storage/Treatment Block. However, disks or tapes may be used as an input source (from an external block) or to transfer output to other blocks. This interfacing file con­sists of descriptive titles, user-supplied pollutant names and dimensions, the simulation starting date and time, the name of the external block gener­ating the output (input) file, the number of time steps and time step size, the total catchment or tributary area, the number of elements (inlets, outfalls, nonconduits, etc.) and pollutants found on the output (input) file, and the elements for which flow and pollutant data are placed (read from) the output (input) file. This preliminary information is followed by the flow and pollutant data for each time step (up to the total number of time steps) for each of the specified elements. The user should refer to Section 2 for a detailed description of the interfacing file.
>
> Flow and up to three pollutants are transferred unchanged from an input file to an output file if the data are from elements or are polluCahts not selected for use in the S/T Block. In other words, the flow and pollutant data from an input file (external block) are altered only if they pass through a storage/ treatment facility. However, the dimensions of the data on the input file will be made to conform to the standard SWHU dimensions before being placed on an output file (see Section 2). The methods of selecting these data from particular external element numbers and processing specific pollutants is discussed in the next subsection.

INSTRUCTIONS FOP DATA PREPARATION

The Storage/Treatment Block is a user-intensive model, i.e., the user should have a thorough knowledge of what he/she is modeling. This is an obvious, but often overlooked, axiom. This is especially true when a model provides<sup>.</sup>"default" values. The user in herein required to describe each unit in some detail with data of his own choosing. Storage/treatment performance depends on local pollutant characteristics, flow rates, etc.; thus, the user is encouraged to use local operating data, whenever possible, to aid in the modeling effort.

Instructions for preparing the input data cards are presented below with suggestions and examples. All entries not described in the text are considered to be self-explanatory or covered sufficiently in Table 7-3. The user is referred to this table for input format and order. All card groups are required unless otherwise stated. Figure 7-2 shows the general structure of the data deck.

<u>Preliminary Information  
Title</u> --

<u>Card Group Al</u> -- This card group allows the user to print a descriptive heading at the start of the printed output. The heading is also transferred to the next block. Two cards are required.

<u>General Information</u> --

<u>Card Group Bl</u> -- The variable NOTAPE allows the user to specify the source of flow and pollutants used for input to the S/T Block. If NOTAPE = 0, the input is provided by an external input file (arranged by the Executive Block). When NOTAPE = 1, the input is provided by card group Jl. If NOTAPE = 2, the input is the sum of the entries for each time step from the external file and card group J1. The parameter JNS selects the external element number (from an external file, NOTAPE = 0 or 2) from which flows and pollu­tants will be taken and passed through the SIT Block. If the input is provided solely by card group Jl (NOTAPE = 1 or 2), the user may label the output of the S/T Block with an element: number. When NOTAPE = 0 or 2, the variables NDT and DS are read from the external input file. However, the value of NDT from an external block may be altered<sup>-</sup>by specifying a non-zero value on card Bl. There is no limit on the number of time steps. This is useful for extending the simulation beyond the limit of the external block or input file. The value of DS from an external block will supersede any value for DS entered on card Bl.

The variable NU specifies the number of storage/treatment units, in­cluding residuals (sludge) handling units, to be modeled and the number of times that card groups Fl through Il are repeated. The model, as written, is limited to five units. However, a few program modifications can increase this limit (see later discussion). The variable NP specifies the number of pollutants to be routed through the storage/treatment system. If NP = 0, then only flows are routed. A maximum of three pollutants may be selected

**for routing. The specific pollutants are selected on card El. However, NP may not be greater than the number of pollutants transferred from other blocks (NOTAPE = 0 or 2).**

**If ICOST = 1, the cost model is called and the capital and operation and maintenance costs are computed for each unit. Cost equation parameters** are entered on card group Jl. The value of METRIC determines whether U.S. customary or metric units are used for all card input and the resulting output. The value of TRIBA is the service area of the S/T plant. It does not enter into the computations but is transferred to the next block.

<u>Starting Time and Print Instructions</u> --

<u>Card Group Cl</u> -- The values of IDATE and ITIME are used to start the date/ time algorithm of the SIT Block. The date (year, month, and day) and time (hour, minutes, and seconds) are updated for each time step. If NOTAPE = O or .2 (card Bl) the values of IDATE and ITIME read from the external file supersede the values entered on card Cl.

The user rutioned against printing large quantities of unwanted information. The first runs should have as little printout as possible (ISUM = 0 and IDET = 0) to check for obvious errors in the input data. As simulation efforts proceed, more detailed printouts may be desired.

<u>Card Group C2</u> -- These cards (up to two) are used to enter the first and last dates of the detailed print periods specified by NPR (card C1).

<u>Evaporation Data</u> --

<u>Card Group D1</u> -- Monthly evaporation rates are required to correct for evap­oration from detention units. However., two cards must be included even if there are no detention units. If needed, values of E(1) through E(12) are entered for the months during which the simulation occurs; others may be left blank.

<u>Pollutant Characterizations</u> --

> Card groups El through E6 are omitted if NP = 0 (card BI).

<u>Card Group El</u> -- These cards (up to two) allow the user to select the NP (card Bi) pollutants to be routed through the SIT Block. The variables IPOLL(1), IPOLL(2), and IPOLL(3) are used to select pollutants from an ex­ternal input file (NOTAPE = 0 or 2, card Bl). For example, if IPOLL(1) = 5, then the first pollutant routed through the S/T Block is the fifth pollutant found on the input file. If data from card group Jl are to be added to the external input file data (NOTAPE = 2, card Bl), the pollutants entered on that card group must be in the same order as specified by IPOLL(1), IPOLL(2), and IPOLL(3).

Pollutants may *be* characterized by their magnitude alone (concentration) or by their magnitude and a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution by specifying IPART(IP) = 0 or 1, respectively. If

> The variables NDIM1(1), NDIM1(2), and NDIM1(3) are used to describe the dimensions of the pollutant data on card group J1 when NOTAPE = 1. When NOTAPE = 0 or 2 (card B1) this information is provided by the external input file. For example, if NDIM1(1) = 0, then the first pollutant has dimensions<sub>i</sub> of mg/l. If NDIM1(1) = 1, then the first pollutant has dimensions of liter This is used when pollutants such as coliforms are routed. When NDIM1(1) = 2, pollutant 1 has other concentration dimensions such as JTU, µmho, °C, pH, etc.

> <u>Card Group E2</u> -- The variable NVS specifies the manner in which the particles in the waste stream are classified. If NVS = 0, the particles are classi­fied by size and specific gravity. The variable NNR specifies the number of size/specific gravity ranges used to delineate the distribution (up to a maximum of 10 ranges). The size/specific gravity classification remains constant throughout the simulation for each pollutant characterized in this manner. The size and specific gravity ranges are established in card groups E3 and E4. These cards and card E5 (which enters waste stream temperature data) provide the information with which an average settling velocity is computed for each range (see Appendix IV for details). If NVS = 1, the particles are classified by NNR settling velocity ranges specified on card group E3. The average settling velocity for each size range is the average of the range endpoints. Cards E4 and E5 are not required. As with the size/specific gravity ranges, this classification remains constant throughout the simulation for each pollutant characterized by settling velocity. Obviously, a particle size or settling velocity distribution may change as it passes through the storage/treatment plant. This is accomplished by altering the pollutant fractions associated with the various size/specific gravity or settling velocity ranges as they pass through the units. The initial pollutant distributions are entered on the E6 cards. These distri­butions remain constant, however, at the input to the S/T plant.

and specific gravity are shown in Table 7-1. The data presented in Table 7-1 are not default values and are presented only as a guide in setting up card groups E2 through E6. Local data, through sieve and/or settling column analyses, are always preferred.

<u>Card Group E3</u> -- These cards (up to two) are used to enter particle size (if NVS = 0, card E2) or settling velocity (if NVS= 1, card E2) ranges. A maxi­mum of ten ranges (as indicated by NNR, card E2) may be catered. The vari­ables RAN(1,1) and RAN(1,2) through RAN(NNR,1) and RAN (NNR,2) represent the lower and upper bounds of the diameters or settling velocities of particles found in ranges 1 through NNR. The ranges entered on this card remain constant through a simulation. When NVS = 0 (card E2), corresponding con­stant values of specific gravity are read on card E4.

<u>Card Group E4</u> -- These cards (up to two) are required only if NVS = 0(card E2). The variables SPG(1) through SPG(NNR) represent the specific gravity of the particles found in size ranges 1 through NNR(card E2). Literature values are shown in Table 7-1.

<u>Card Group E5</u> -- These cards (two) are required only if NVS = 0(r.-rd E2). The variables TEMP(1) through TEMP(12) represent the average wastewater temperatures for each month of the year. Water temperature has a direct ef­fect on the settling velocity of a particle. This is reflected through the viscosity of the wastewater which is a function of temperature. The user is referred to Appendix IV for details.

<u>Card Group E6</u> A set (consisting of up to two cards) of E6 cards is required for each pollutant characterized by a particle size/specific grav­ity or settling velocity distribution (IPART(1P) = 1, card El). For example, if IPART(1) = 1(card El) the variables PSD(1,1) through PSD(1, NNR) represent the fraction of pollutant 1 found in the particle size/ specific gravity or settling velocity ranges 1 through NNR entering unit 1 (all flows and pollu­tants must enter the S/T plant at unit 1). Naturally, these fractions

should sum to 1.0. Table 7-1 contains some literature values for several pollutants (particle size/specific gravity distributions only).

The distribution entering the S/T plant remains constant throughout the simulation; however, it may change as the pollutants move through the var­ious units. This is an approximation of the more probable situation in which the plant influent distributions change with time. This limitation was necessary due to the fact that no other SWMM blocks generate such dis­tributions for input to the S/T Block. However, the S/T Block can be easily modified to accept time-varying distributions should such a capability be developed in the future.

<u>Storage/Treatment Unit Information</u>

Card groups Fl through Il are repeated for each storage/treatment unit (up to NU, card Bl). The unit number, I, is determined by the order in which each set of card groups Fl through Il appears. This numbering scheme is important to the permissible configurations of units. There are two rules for numbering units; 1) flows and pollutant exiting from one unit must

be directed to a unit with a number greater than its own; and 2) all flows and pollutants entering the S/T system must enter unit 1. The flows enter­ing and exiting a unit are shown in Figure 7-3. Several examples of storage/treatment plant configurations are shown in Figure 7-4.

<u>General Unit Information</u> --

<u>Card Croup Fl</u> -- This card is used to enter the name of unit I.

<u>Card Group F2</u> -- The variable IDENT(I) describes the unit I as a nondeten-tion (IDENT(I) = 0) or detention process (IDENT(I) = 1). If IDENT(I) = 1, all or portions of card group H must be included.

Each unit is assigned a maximum inflow, QtiAX(I), beyond which all flows and pollutants are bypassed. However, this variable may be set to an ab­normally high value for design purposes (i.e., responses at all possible inputs) or set at a realistic value for modeling existing or proposed facil­ities. The variable QRF(I) is used to specify the residual flow, as a fraction of the inflow, for non-detention units only (IDENT(I) = 0).

The variables IDIREC(I,1), IDIREC(I,2) and IDIREC(I,3) are used to direct bypassed flow and pollutants, treated outflow, and residuals from unit I to other units. The values entered for these variables represent the unit numbers to which these flows and pollutants are to be directed. Addi­tionally, these flows may be sent directly to the next block (e.g., Receiving Block) or to ultimate disposal (which simply removes them from the simulation) by specifying IDIREC(I,ID) = 100 or 200, respectively. The flows and pollu­tants directed to the next block are summed for all the units and transferred as a single stream. Any unit to which flows are directed must have a unit number greater than the source unit (see Figure 7-4 for examples).

Pollutant Removal --

Pollutants are removed by settling or obstruction when characterized by particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distributions. When they are characterized by magnitude (concentration) alone, removal is simu­lated through removal equations. Card groups G1 through G3 are used to establish these removal equations. When a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution is used and the unit is classified as a non-detention process, then a critical size or settling velocity is selected. The model removes all particles with a size or settling velocity greater than or equal to the critical size. Card G4 is used to enter this parameter.

Card groups G1 through G4 are repeated for each pollutant unless a detention unit is specified (IDENT(1) = 1, card F2) and a particle size/ specific gravity or settling velocity distribution is specified for pollu­tant IP (IPART(IP) = 1, card El). Naturally, these card groups are omitted if no pollutants are routed (NP = 0, card B1). Again, card groups G1 through G3 are used only if the pollutant is characterized solely by magnitude. Card G4 is used only if a pollutant is characterized by magnitude and a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution (IPART(IP) = 1, card El) and a non-detention unit is specified (IDENT(I) = 0, card F2).

where x. = removal equation variables,

> a\. = coefficients, and
>
> R = removal fraction, 0 ≤ R ≤ 1.0.

Each removal equation variable, x., may represent, one of several parameters available in the program at each time step and these options are discussed below (card gronp G2 ). With these variables and the coefficients, a., the user can develop the desired removal equation. The coefficients are Antered on card group G3.

A maximum removal fraction is specified by RMX(I,IP) This is partic-cularly useful for equations which mathematically generate values of the removal fraction, R, that may exceed a reasonable value or 1.0. RNX(I,IP) provides an upper bound on such equations.

<u>Card Group G2</u> -- These cards (two) allow the user to assign various program variables to the variables in equation 7-1. For example, if pollutant 1 (IP = 1) is to be removed in unit I by a removal equation, the values given INPUT(I,1,1) through INPUT(I,1,11) assign program variables to the corre-

sponding variables x<sub>l</sub> through x in equation 7-1. The program variables available for inclusion are shown in Table 7-2. An example removal equation is discussed below.

<u>Card Group G3</u> -- The variables A(I,IP,3) through A(I,IP,16) represent the variables a<sub>1</sub> through a<sub>16</sub> in equation 7-1 as applied to pollutant IP in unit I. Two cards are required.

An example of applying equation 7-1 is provided by a suspended solids removal equation used in an earlier version of the Storage/Treatment Block for sedimentation (detention) units:

This equation can be constructed from equation 7-1 by setting a<sub>12</sub> (or A(I,

All other coefficients, a. (or A(I,IP,J)), would equal zero. RMX(I,IP) (card Gl) would not Ie necessary, as R<sub>max</sub> limits the value of R. Appendix IV contains other examples.

<u>Card Group G4</u> -- The variable PSC(I) specifies a critical particle size (if NVS = 0, card E2) or settling velocity (if NVS = 1, card E2) that Onotes the point above which all particles are removed from the influent. This parameter is included primarily to model such non-detention units as micro-screens, fine screens, and coarse screens. An approximation of the removal effectiveness of screens may be obtained by letting PSC(I) equal the aper­ture size of the screen (see Appendix IV). Card G4 is required <u>only</u> if IPART(IP) = 1 (card El) and IDENT(I) = 0 (card F2).

Detention Unit Data --

Card groups H1 through H8 are used to describe the special charac­teristics of detention units. Sedimentation, dissolved air floatation, chlorination, and sludge thickening are some of the processes that may be modeled by a detention unit.

These cards primarily describe the hydraulic characteristics of a detention unit and, thus, are required only if IDENT(I) = 1 (card F2).

<u>Card Group H1</u> -- The variable IROUTE(I) specifies the manner in which pol­lutants are routed in detention unit I. When IROUTE(I) = 0 the unit routes pollutants under the assumption of perfect plug flow. Perfect plug flow is recommended for long, rectangular tanks where settling is the most important removal mechanism and is <u>required</u> when <u>any</u> pollutant is characterized by a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution (IPART(IP) = 1, card El). Removed pollutants are accumulated in plug-flow units, without decay, until removed by the residual flow. When IROUTE(I) = 1 the unit routes pollutants under the assumption of perfect miximg. Complete mixing is most applicable to small tanks where the primary purpose is to thoroughly mix the contents (e.g., rapid-mix chlorination, flocculators, and mixing tanks). Removed pollutant quantities are not allowed to accumulate in completely-mixed units (i.e., no settling). The user is referred to Appendix IV for further explanation.

The variable IOUT(I) is used to describe the depth-treated outflow relationship that characterizes the discharge of treated outflow (e.g., weir flow) from unit I. The user is given three options. The first (IOUT(I) = 0)

> 306 7-15

is to provide the model with as many as sixteen data pairs describing the depth-outflow relationship (entered on card group I3). The second option (IOUT(I) = 1) is to approximate the relationship by a power equation (entered on card H4). The third option (IOUT(I)=2) specifies a constant pumping rate between certain depths (entered on card H5).

In addition to treated outflow, a residual stream may be drawn from the unit during periods of no inflow or treated outflow. When a residual stream occurs from a plug-flow unit the entire unit contents (including the removed pollutant quantities) are mixed (i.e., the remaining plugs lose their iden­tity) and drawn off until the unit is empty or inflow occurs. If inflow begins before the unit is empty the remaining contents are placed in a single plug for further routing. In a completely-mixed unit, the pollutant concentrations in the residual flow are identical to the concentrations in the treated outflow. Again, the flow is suspended when inflow occurs. The variable IDRAW(I) simply specifies the conditions under which a residual stream begins. If IDRAW(I) = 0, a residual stream is never drawn and the accumulated pollutants (if IROUTE(I) = 0) remain in the unit. If IDRAW(I) 5 -1, the residuals are drawn off starting at every -IDRAW(I) time steps (but Ll.le flow is delayed if inflow and/ur ti:eaLed ouLilow is in progress). This option corresponds with the situation in which the unit is drained on a

regular (e.g., scheduled) basis. If IDRAW(I) 1, the residuals are drawn after IDRAW(I) time steps of no inflow or treated outflow. The conditions

specified by IDRAW(I) 1 apply directt.y to the case in which the unit contents are drained after each runoff event.

The variable IRES(I) is used to describe the depth-residual flow re­lationship that characterizes the draw off of the residual stream from unit I. If IRES(I) = 0, the user provides the model with as many as sixteen data pairs describing the depth-residual flow relationship (entered on the H3 cards). If IRES(I) = 1, the relationship is approximated by a power equa­tion (entered on card H6).

<u>Card Group H2</u> -- The parameters on this card are required <u>only</u> when a part­icle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution is used to characterize <u>any</u> pollutant (IPART(IP) = 1, card El) and unit I is a plug-flow detention unit (IROUTE(I) = 0, card Hi).

The variable ALEN(I) represents the travel length for plugs in unit I. The variable AMAN(I) is the Manning's roughness coefficient for the surfaces of unit I and is commonly available for many materials. These values are required for the pollutant removal algorithms used when a particle size/ specific gravity or settling velocity distribution characterizes a pollutant (see Appendix IV).

<u>Card Group H3</u> -- These cards are used to enter up to sixteen sets of data describing the geometry and hydraulics of detention unit I. Each card enters a value for depth, SDEPTH(I,MM), along with the corresponding values of surface area, SAREA(I,MM), volume, SSTORE(I,MM), treated outflow, SQQ0U(I,MM), and residual flow, SQQRS(I,MM). <u>The series is terminated by a</u> blank card.

> **The only required parameters are DEPTH(I,MM) and SAREA(I,MM); the need for the other parameters depends on other factors. If SSTORE(I,MM) is left blank on <u>every</u> H3 card, the program will estimate the volume at each depth by averaging the surface area at each depth and the lower adjacent depth, multiplying by the difference in depth, and adding the result to the esti­mated volume at the lower adjacent depth. A value for treated outflow, SQQOU(I,MM), is required for each depth only if IOUT(I) = 0 (card H1). If LOUT = 1 or 2 (card HI), this relationship** is provided by card 114 or caid **H5, respectively. Likewise, a value for residual flow, SQQRS(I,MM), is required for each depth only if IRES(I) = 0 (card H1). If IRES(I) = 1 (card H1), this relationship is described by card H6. The values entered for SQQRS(I,MM) are used during periods in which a residual stream is drawn from the unit (IDRAW(I), card I1).**

The program also gener­ates a relationship between depth and the evaporation rate (see card group D1). These relationships are used to route flows through a detention unit Iming the Pills method (Viessman et al., 1977). This method is described in detail in Appendix IV.**
>
> **<u>Card Group H4</u> -- This card is required <u>only</u> if a power equation is to de­scribe the depth-treated outflow relationship (IOUT(I) = 1, card H1). The equation is**

**where** <sup>g</sup>out **= treated outflow, ft<sup>3</sup>/sec \[m**<sup>3</sup>/sec\],

>
> D **= water depth in detention unit, ft \[m\], and**
>
> D**<sub>O</sub> = depth below which there is no treated outflow, ft \[m\].**

**The user supplies the values of D<sub>0</sub>, C1, and C<sub>2</sub> (program <sup>v</sup>ariables DO<sup>,</sup> Cl, and C2, respectively).**

**Two common outlet structures that may be modeled with equation 7-3 are the orifice and the broad-crested weir. For example, a weir could be modeled by letting C<sub>i</sub> = 3.33 • L where L = length of the weir in feet, C<sub>2</sub> = 1.5, and D<sub>0</sub> = depth at the bottom of the weir in feet. These substitutions yield the familiar weir equation.**

**<u>Card Group H5</u> -- This card is required <u>only</u> if pumping is specified for the treated outflow from a detention unit (IOUT(I) = 2, card H1). The variables DSTART(I,1) and DSTART(I,2) represent the depths at which the pumping rates QPUMP(I,1) and QPUMP(I,2) begin. The variable DSTOP(I) specifies the depth at which all pumping stops. In other words, the rate QPUMP(I,1) occurs when**

> **308 7-17**
>
> the depth is equal to or exceeds DSTART(I,1) and the rate QPUMP(I,2) occurs when the depth is greater than or equal to DSTART(I,2). The pumping rate reverts to the rate QPUMP(I,1) when the depth falls below DSTART(I,2) and continues at that rate until the depth falls to DSTOP(I). The value of DSTART(I,1) must be less than or equal to DSTART(I,2) and DSTOP(I) must be less than or equal to DSTART (1,1).

> <u>Card Group H7</u> -- This card is used to indicate the build up of sludge in a plug-flow detention unit (tROUTE(I) = 0, card H1). The user specifies the pollutant used to calculate the sludge volume, NPSL(I); the concentration of pollutant NPSL(E) in sludge; and the depth at which a warning is given to indicate that sludge has accumulated to an unacceptable level. The sludge volume is increased by dividing the amount of pollutant NPSL(I) removed each <u>time</u> step by SLDEN(I). The model assumes that the sludge volume has no effect on the available storage volume and that no compression occurs. The information on this card is only used to warn the user of a possible maintenance/performance problem.
>
> <u>Card Group H8</u> -- This card specifies the total volume, WARN(I), and pollu­tant concentrations, PCO(I,IP), present in the unit at the start of the simulation. Obviously, the values of PCO(I,IP) are not required if NP = 0 (card B1) or WARN(I) = 0.0.

Equations 7-9 through 7-12 differ only in the variable used to compute the operation and maintenance costs for unit I. The variable KPC(I,2) specifies which variable is used (as shown in Table 7-3) and CC(I,3), CC(I,4), and CC(I,5) represent thc<sup>,</sup>. coefficients d, f, and h.

The user is cautioned not to misinterpret the cost calculated by the model. For example, in a single-event simulation the calculated capital cost can only be considered an estimator of the true capital cost when the simulated event is a design event. Likewise, when operating time is a factor in computing operation and maintenance costs, the calculated costs can be a valid estimator of the true costs only when a long-term simulation is performed. Recent EPA publications provide useful information for the proper selection of the coefficients required in equations 7-5 through 7-12 (EPA, 1976; Benjes, 1976).

<u>Input Waste Stream</u>

<u>Flow and Pollutant Data</u> --

> Card group Jl is required <u>only</u> if NOTAPE = 1 or 2 (card Bl).

<u>Card Group Jl</u> -- This card is repeated for <u>each</u> time step including those with no inflow. The pollutant concentrations, PCAR(IP), must be entered in the same order as on card El and have the same dimensions specified by NDIM(IP) and PUNIT(IN,IP)(card El). If NOTAPE = 2 (card BI), the flow and concentrations are added to the values from the external tape or disk. All values are instantaneous flows or concentrations (at the end of the time step).

ALTERING THE PROGRAM SIZE

The Storage/Treatment Block, as presently written, is capable of model­ing a maximum of five S/T units. To alter this restriction requires that the number 5, which appears in several lines of seven subrountines, be changed to the desired maximum. The specific subroutines and lines (num­bered in columns 72 through 80) are as follows:

> 311 7-20
>
> <u>Subroutine</u> STRT: 14 through 27.
>
> <u>Subroutine STRDAT:</u> 4 through 18.

> <u>Subroutine CONTRL:</u> 4 through 19 and 21 through 24.

>
> <u>Subroutine PLUGS:</u> 3
>
> <u>Subroutine EQUATE:</u> 3 through 16.
>
> <u>Subroutine STCOST:</u> 4 through 17.
>
> When a detention unit is modeled as a plug-flow reactor(IDENT(I) = 1, card F2, and IROUTE(I) = 0, card H1) the maximum number of plugs allowed to be in the unit at any one time is 50. The program will terminate if this limit is exceeded. However, the user can increase this capacity by changing the number 50 to the desired value in the following lines (numbered in columns 72-80):

SECTION 8

RECEIVING WATER BLOCK

The Receiving Water Model (Receive) has been a block of SWMM since the original SWMM development. Receive is a dynamic, branching one-dimensional network model that is often used as a pseudo-two dimensional model when the links and nodes are arranged in a triangular or other grid pattern. Based upon the EPA Dynamic Estuary Model (DEM), it is one of several variants of the DEM, and in turn, has had several other models developed based upon it. Due to the proliferation of link-node models that are direct descendants of DEM or Receive, the EPA Athens, Georgia Laboratory decided in 1980 to combine the best features of the several variants into one new Receive/DEM-type model. It was also decided that this would be the appropriate model for use with SWMM when completed. As of this writing (May 1981), work is still underway on the model and its User's Manual. Rather than publish outdated information on Receive, it was decided to use this documentation in the form of an addendum to this SWMM Version III User's Manual when it became available. Hence, no details on Receive are included herein.

Current (May 1981) Receive capabilities are relatively unchanged since the Version II SWMM (Huber et al., 1975), although a few minor changes were included with an interim SWMM release in 1977. Persons needing the Receive model should contact Mr. Tom Barnwell or Robert Ambrose of the EPA Athens lab for information on the best available version since it will not be included with the rest of the SWMM Ver­sion III release.

SECTION 9

STATISTICS BLOCK

BLOCK DESCRIPTION  
<u>Introduction</u>

The Statistics Block has been developed to provide the added capability within SWMM to perform simple statistical analyses on continuous event data. Both quantity and quality parameters may be analyzed. The options available include a table depicting the sequential series of events, a table of magni­tude, return period and frequency of events, a graph of magnitude vs. retura period, a graph of magnitude vs. frequency, and the first three moments of the event data.

Statistical analyses are performed on data read from an interface file arranged in the standardized SWMM format (refer to Section 2). The Statis­tics Block may be called after any block that generates such a file. In addition, the user may create an interface file of rainfall or other data and, through an understanding and alteration of various conversion factors, use the Statistics Block to analyze rainfall, rather than stormwater events.

Separation of the data into events depends on the unique series of zero and non-zero instantaneous flow values found at each location within the system being simulated. The results of the analyses would be expected to vary from location to location. The Statistics Block handles only one location at a time.

This section describes the program operation of the Statistics Block, identifies output options, provides instructions for preparing input data cards, defines program variables, presents the equations utilized within the block and explains the messages and labels that may be printed.

<u>Program Operation</u>

The Statistics Block is a Fortran program of approximately 1500 state­ments in length and consists of six subroutines. The relationships among the Statistics Block, the rest of SWMM and the various subroutines are shown in Figure 9-1.

The subroutine STATS comprises the major portion of the block. Input data and data from the interface file are read in STATS. Descriptive infor­mation from the file header is printed, followed by a summary of the input data. STATS separates the flow/pollutant data into events and writes this

new data set on an off-line file. The write statement contains 561 bytes. Using disk storage with 19500 bytes per track, data for 34 events can be stored on one track. With an internal program limit of 3750 events, 111 tracks of disk storage are required for the Statistics Block. The limit of 3750 can be changed, resulting in a change in off-line storage requirements.

After the entire simulation period has been examined, a table of the sequential series of events is printed (if requested). If a table of return period and frequency or a graph of either of these is requested, SORT is called to sort the series into descending order. SBTABL is utilized to generate and print the table of magnitude, return period and frequency. POINTS is called prior to CURVE. POINTS generates an array of (X,Y) pairs to be plotted as points on either the return period or frequency graph. CURVE and PPLOT are part of the Executive Block and are used to print the graphs. MOMENT calculates and prints the mean, variance, standard devia­tion, coefficient of variation and coefficient of skewness of the event data. LABELS is a Block Data subroutine utilized for initializing constants in labeled common blocks that are used for labeling graphs and other output.

<u>Output Options</u>

The table of sequential series of events depicts the original time series of flow data after the time steps have been grouped into events. The table includes the date and time of day that each event began, flow volume of each event, duration of each event and interevent durations. The table of magnitude, return period and frequency is a rank order table showing the date and time that each event began, the magnitude of the event being ana­lyzed, the return period (in months) of that magnitude and the percent of occurrences that are less than or equal to the given magnitude. The graph of magnitude vs. return period is a plot of two columns of the table, except that return period is presented as the base ten logarithm. The graph of magnitude vs. frequency is a similar plot with frequency presented as a per­cent. Although the graphing routines plot information centered in the table, it is not necessary to select the table option in order to select the graph options. Any of these may be printed independently of the others. The last option available is a calculation of a number of sample statistics of the event data (enumerated above).

The table of sequential series pertains only to the volume of the flow events. The remaining options can be requested for flow or pollutants. Any (or all) of these can be selected for any (or all) of the five flow parame­ters and for any (or all) of the five pollutant parameters. Different pol­lutant parameters can be analyzed for different pollutants. Events are identified on the basis of zero and nonzero flow values so that the duration of events and interevents will be identical for flow and any of the pollu-. tants selected.

<u>Potential for Output</u>

<u>Sequential Series of Events</u> --

This option prints a table of the original series of events before any sorting has taken place. Printing of the table, which contains 120 events

> 332 9-3

**per page, may bt! accessed in several ways. First, the table may be printed directly as an option under normal program execution. Second, when the num­ber of events in the time series exceeds the designated limit and termination of the program has not been requested, the table may be printed (ignoring the rest of the series). Third, in the case where termination has been selected, the option remains to print a table for that portion of the series Lhat has been separated into events.**

**<u>Table of Magnitude, Return Period and Frequency</u> --**

**For those parameters where this option is requested, one table will be printed for each parameter chosen for each constitutent chosen. For example, if, for the constitutent 'FLOW', two parameters are chosen (e.g., total flow and event duration), and for each of two pollutants two parameters are chosen (e.g., total load and peak concentration), then six separate tables are printed, each containing magnitude, return period and frequency for the appropriate parameter. Therefore, although it is unlikely that one would have reason to do so, up to 55 tables can be printed in one run (five flow parameters, and five pollutant parameters for ten pollutants). The length** of eaoh table depends on the number **of events within the period of analysis (180 events are printed per page).**

**<u>Graph of Magnitude vs. Return Period or Graph of Magnitude vs. Frequency</u> --**

**The following discussion refers to either type of graph. As with the tables above, one graph is printed for each parameter chosen of each constit­uent for which a graph is requested. Each graph comprises one page of output. Again, up to 55 graphs can be printed, although this would be an unlikely choice.**

**<u>Moments</u> --**

**This option calculates and prints unbiased estimates for the mean, vari­ance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and coefficient of skew­ness. These values will be printed for each parameter chosen for each con­stituent chosen. The output incorporates approximately 15 lines and will appear in sequence where space is available (i.e., a new page is not printed for each set of moments).**

**PREPARATION OF INPUT DATA  
<u>Extent of Data </u>**

**The Statistics Block requires a minimal amount of input data under nor­mal use. The flow/pollutant data to be analyzed will be read from interface files generated by other blocks of SWMM. The input data required simply indicate what type of analysis should be performed on the interface data. Use of the block for rainfall data will be discussed in a later subsection.**

**Card by card instructions for preparing the input data cards will be presented. The user is referred to Table 9-2 at the end of this section for**

> The variable ISTART and TSTART indicate the date and time, respec­tively, at which the program should begin searching for events. The vari­able IEND and TEND indicate the last point on the file that should be read. In this manner, the user can choose any period within the record (e.g., one particular year, five sequential years, etc) on which to perform statistical analyses. Default values of zero for both date and time can be chosen for starting and/or ending. Zero starting values indicate that analyses should commence with the first value on the interface file. Zero ending values indicate that analyses should continue to the end of the available record. Formats for date and time correspond to the standardized interface format.

> The minimum interevent time (MIT) indicates the minimum number of dry time steps (time steps with zero flow) that will constitute an interevent. In other words, the number of consecutive dry time steps encountered in the search must be equal to or greater than MIT in order that the preceding wet period (made up of at least one nonzero flow value) be considered a separate event. Dry periods of duration less than MIT may exist within an event preceded and followed by wet time steps. The number of events in a given period of analysis is directly dependent on the value of MIT. A value of zero may be chosen for MIT; in this manner every wet time step will be viewed as a separate event. No "correct" value of MIT can be suggested, although a value of 6 to 22 hrs is often used to separate <u>rainfall</u> events (Heaney et al., 1977). The value utilized depends on the criteria employed by the user in defining an event.

> The variable LOCRQ indicates at which location, e.g., inlet or manhole number, within the system the analyses are being performed. The interface file may contain data for up to 200 locations, each identified in the array
>
> LOCNOS(K). The variable LOCRQ should have the same value as one of the elements of the array LOCNOS(K).
>
> The variable NPR indicates the number of pollutants requested for statistical analysis. NPR must be less than or equal to NPOLL (the number of pollutants on the interface file).
>
> <u>Card Group B2</u>
>
> The variable array IPOLRQ will contain up to ten elements, corres­ponding to the maximum value of NPR (and NPOLL). The pollutants requested for analysis must be identified by their position on the interface file (not by name). Therefore, the elements of IPOLRQ will contain integer values from 1 to 1O. For example, if the first pollutant to be analyzed is BOD, and BOD is the third pollutant on the interface file, then IPOLRQ(1) would have the value 3. Similarly, if the second pollutant to be analyzed is TSS, and TSS is the fifth pollutant on the interface file, then IPOLRQ(2) would have the value 5.

> The four "C" cards indicate the statistical options requested for flow. One card is used for each type of statistical option. Card Cl is for a table of event magnitude, return period and frequency. Card C2 is for a graph of magnitude vs. return period. Card C3 is for a graph of magnitude vs. fre­quency. Card C4 is for a table of the first three moments of the event data. There are five fields on each card, one field for each of the five flow parameters. The five parameters are (1) total flow for the event, measured as a volume and reported as inches \[mm\], (2) average flow for the event, measured as a rate and reported as inches/hour \[mm/hr\], (3) peak flow for the event, measured as an instantaneous rate and reported as inches/hour \[mm/hr\], (4) duration of the event, measured as the number of time steps making up the event and reported as hours, and (5) duration of the inter-event, measured as the number of dry time steps preceding the event and reported as hours. For a given card, those fields containing a 1 indicate the flow parameters for which that option has been selected. Values of zero indicate that the analyses should not be performed.
>
> <u>Card Groups D1-D4</u>
>
> The four "D" cards are identical in format to the "C" cards. The four statistical options available for flow are also available for pollutants. Again, one card is used for each type of statistical option. An entire set of "D" cards must be included for each pollutant requested, indicating which options for which parameters should be performed for each pollutant. The "D" cards should be arranged as a group (D1-D4), with groups of cards in a sequence corresponding to the order in which the pollutants were requested. Again, there are five fields on each card, one field for each of the five pollutant parameters. The five parameters are (1) total load, measured as a sum of the concentration times the flow rate and reported as pounds \[kg\], (2) average load, measured as a rate of pollutant loading and reported as lbs/hour \[kg/hr\], (3) peak load, measured as an instantaneous rate of pollu­tant loading and reported as lbs/hour \[kg/hr\], (4) flow weighted average concentration, reported as mg/1, and (5) peak concentration, reported as mg/l. As noted in Table 9-2, at least one set of Dl-D4 cards must be included. If NPR = 0, all "D" cards would contain zero values (or be left blank).

<u>Card Groups G1 and G2</u>

The variable KTERM indicates whether or not to terminate analyses in the case where the number of events exceeds the allowable computer memory space. The number of events that can be sorted and analyzed has been set within the program at 3750. This value corresponds to 150 events per year for a 25 year period. As noted at the beginning of the STATS subroutine, this value may be altered by the user. If the number of events exceeds the limit set, the program will either (a) perform the analyses on the events already identified, ignoring the remainder of the record (KTERM = 0), or (b) terminate execution of the block, performing no event analysis (KTERM = 1). If the analyses are being performed, a table of the sequential series will be printed if KSEQ = 1. If the analyses are not performed, the option still exists to print the table of sequential series before termination. The variable KTSEQS indicates that the table should or should not be printed in this case.

COMPUTATIONS

<u>Return Period and Frequency</u>

The logic of the program is described by comment statements at the beginning of each subroutine and throughout the program listing. Computa­tions that require further explanation will be discussed.

In subroutine STATS, the variables Ti and T2 indicate the beginning and end, respectively, of the period of analysis. The values are reported as elapsed time from the beginning of the simulation, measured in hours. The return period of an event of a given magnitude is reported as months so that a calculation of, the number of months (NOMOS) within the period of analysis is required. The average number of hours per month in a year of 365.25 days is 730.5. This value is used to find a value for NOMOS, rounded to the nearest month, by the equation

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 70%" />
<col style="width: 29%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>NOMOS = Integer <sup><u>((T2-T1)</u></sup> + 0.5 1'</p>
<p>730.5</p></td>
<td>(9-1)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For short periods of analysis (e.g., on the order of one year) NOMOS may be in error by one month depending on which months of the year are included in the period. This should pose little difficulty as a return period analysis for such a short period is generally not undertaken (or at best is of questionable worth).

In subroutine TABLES, calculations are made of the return period and frequency of events. The program is set up in such a way that the equation used depends on the column of the table in which the values will be printed. These calculations are summarized in the general forms

> **where X = magnitude of the event parameter, and**

As a prelude to this discussion, an explanation of the units provided in the tables and graphs is called for. Table 9-1 summarizes the units printed for flow and three types of pollutants. The labels printed for the ordinate of the graphs are also presented.**
>
> **All flow parameters are normalized to depth or depth/hr (i.e., in or mm or in/hr or mm/nr). Should true volumes be desired, they may be obtained by multiplying by the catchment area, printed after reading the interface file.**
>
> **When NDIM = 2, a special message is printed on the graph nr table. Rather than printing the units described in Table 9-2, the output contains "SEE NOTE" and the note "Magnitude has units of .... See user manual for explanation." The explanation referred to is included in the following discussion.**
>
> **The user is referred to Sections 2 and 4 for an introduction to the variable NDIM. For NDIM = 0, pollutant concentration is given in mg/l. In this case, a direct conversion is possible for loading rates and concentra­tions. For NDIM = 1, pollutant concentration is given in "other quantity" per liter (e.g., MPN/1). Here, no conversion is possible to mass loading or mass per unit volume. "Mass" must be presented** as **"quantity" and the user must be aware of what "quantity" refers to for** the **pollutant involved. The units printed for flow weighted average concentration and peak concentration will correspond to the variable PUNIT found on the interface file for the particular pollutant. For NDIM = 2, pollutant concentration is given in some other units, not on a "per liter" basis (e.g., JTU). Therefore, no units conversion can be made. Magnitudes reported for total load will have units of a volume multiplied by the appropriate PUNIT. The magnitude is obtained by summing the pollutant values found on the interface file (which are in units of an instantaneous flow rate multiplied by a concentration) and multiplying this value by the time step size (DTSEC) of the event. Interpretation of the significance of these magnitudes is left strictly to the user, who should exercise caution in selecting this statistical option. A similar caution applies to average load and peak load. These magnitudes will have units of a flow rate multiplied by the appropriate PUNIT. The average load is the mean of the values found on the interface file for a given event, with a units conversion for flow rate. The peak load is the largest of the values within an event, with a similar units conversion for flow rate. Flow weighted average concentration and peak concentration will have units corresponding to PUNIT for the particular pollutant and an inter­pretation of these magnitudes may *be* simpler than the above parameters. The calculation of these two parameters is self-evident.**

> ANALYSIS OF RAI;WALL DATA
>
> A series of rainfall measurements can be viewed as analogous to a series of flow values and can be analyzed using the statistical options for flow. The following discussion assumes that the rainfall record is in hourly time steps. The user can make similar adjustments for other types of rainfall records.
>
> An interface file of the standardized SWMM format must be generated by the user. This will contain rainfall data only, no pollutants. The file may contain data for a number of locations, but only one location may ***be*** analyzed during a run.
>
> The event parameters will be viewed as follows: Values reported as "total flow" will be total depth of the storm, in inches; values reported as "average flow" will be average intensity during the event, in inches/hour, and calculated as the total depth divided by the duration of the event; "peak flow" will ***be*** peak intensity, in inches/hour, and will be the largest single hourly value recorded for the storm; event duration and interevent duration are identical in concept to stormwater events.
>
> Variables that require the assignment of particular values are: <u>For the interface file:</u>

- DTSEC = 3600

- TRIBA = 1.000

- QCONV = 1.00833 =

> 12 in/ft x 3600 sec/hr
>
> <u>For the input data:</u>

- NPR = 0

- KENGSI = 0

> The input data also require one set of "D" cards, all blank.
>
> As regards labels for the output, the term "FLOW" will remain. The user must think of this in the context of the options selected (i.e., depth or intensity). The remainder of the program operation will be identical to stormwater events.

APPENDIX I

CONTINUOUS SIMULATION

CONTINUOUS AND SINGLE EVENT SIMULATION

The original Storm Water Management Model, designed for single event simulation, produced detailed (i.e., short time increment) hydrographs and pollutographs for individual storm events. Although this capability remains, the model has now been altered. so that it may be run for an unlimited number of time steps, for multiple events. In this mode it may be used in a plan­ning context, that is, for an overall assessment of urban runoff problems sad estimates cf the effectiveness and costs of abatement procedures. Trade­offs among various control options, such as storage, treatment and street sweeping, may be evaluated. Complex interactions between the meteorology, e.g., precipitation patterns, and the hydrology of an area may be simulated without resorting to average values or very simplified methods. In this manner, critical events from the long period of simulation may be selected for detailed analysis. In addition, return periods for intensity, duration and volume (mass) of runoff (pollutant loads) may be assigned on the basis of the simulated record instead of incorrectly equating them to the same statistics of the rainfall record. In this manner, the critical events chosen for study may be substituted for hypothetical "design storms", the latter often being synthesized from intensity-duration-frequency curves on the basis of questionable statistical assumptions. Linsley and Crawford (1974) present a useful discussion of continuous simulation in urban hydrology.

Several continuous simulation models are available for urban runoff analysis. Among the earliest was the Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), out of which evolved the HSPF Model (Johanson et al., 1980), a versatile program for natural and agricultural as well as urban areas. It uses a 15 minute time step whereas a 5 minute time step is used by the Dorsch QQS model (Geiger et al., 1974, Geiger and Dorsch, 1980). Probably the most widely used continuous simulation model for urban areas is STORM (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1977, Rosener et al., 1974), developed by Water Resources Engineers, the City of San Francisco and the Hydrologic Engineering Center of the Corps of Engineers. It utilizes one hour time steps coupled with simplified runoff and pollutant estimation procedures and has been extensively used for planning (Roesner et al., 1974) and overall urban runoff evaluation (Heaney et al., 1977). A similar, but even simpler model, still producing useful statistics of long-term urban runoff, is the Simplified Storm Water Management Model developed by Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. (Lager et al., 1976). Finally, several "first cut" procedures have been developed, based in part upon continuous simulation, but avoiding any computer usage at all (Hydro-science, Inc., 1976, Howard, 1976, Heaney et al., 1976, Chan and Bras, 1979).

> 367 I-1
>
> CONTINUOUS SWIM OVERVIEW
>
> SWMM is run continuously using only the Runoff and Storage/Treatment (S/T) blocks. Routing in Transport, WRE Transport (EXTRAN) or Receiving is avoided and is unnecessary for the planning purposes to which the model is applied. (However, there is no limitation on the number of time steps for either Extran, Transport or Receive). A "Level III" receiving water model that will couple with either continuous SWHM or STORM has been developed based upon earlier work (Heaney et al., 1977) and is documented (Medina, 1979). The algorithms used in Runoff and S/T are almost identical when run continuously or as a single event model, the only differences occuring in a minor way in the snowmelt routines. A one-hour time step is required when the model receives input from National Weather Service (NWS) precipitation and temperature tapes, which will be true for most applications. Although other time steps may be used, the output is generally formated for an assumed 24 time steps per day. In fact, inclusion of daily, monthly and annual totals along with a few other I/O features forms about the only distinction between the continuous and single event mode.
>
> It is anticipated that continuous, long-term simulation will only be used with a very coarse, "lumped" or aggregated catchment schematization in order to minimize computer costs. For example, only one subcatchment and no gutter/pipes will often suffice.
>
> SNOWMELT
>
> Following the earlier work of the Canadian SWMM study by Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren (1976a, 1976b) snowmelt simulation has been added for both single event and continuous simulation. Since snowmelt com­putations are explained in detail in Appendix II, only an outline is given here. Most techniques are drawn from Anderson's (1973) work for the National Weather Service (NWS). For continuous simulation, daily max-min temperatures from the NWS "WSAN Summary of the Day, Deck 345" are converted to hourly values by sinusoidal interpolation.
>
> Urban snow removal practices may be simulated through "redistribution fractions" input for each subcatchment (see Figure II-6 in Appendix II), through alteration of the melt coefficients and base temperatures for-the regions of each subcatchment, and through the areal depletion curves•used for continuous simulation. Anderson's temperature-index and heat balance melt equations are used for melt computations during dry and rainy periods, respectively. For continous simulation, the "cold content" of the pack is maintained in order to "ripen" the snow before melting. Routing of melt water through the snow pack is performed as a simple reservoir routing pro­cedure, as in the Canadian study.
>
> The presence of a snow pack is assumed to have no effect on overland flow processes beneath it. Melt is routed in the same manner as rainfall.

368 I-2

> INPUT DATA
>
> Continuous SWMM requires all data entries previously required except that a coarse schematization greatly reduces the amount of entries required for subcatchments and gutter/pipes (see below). The key data need is a long­term precipitation record for the area. SWMM is keyed to the use of magnetic tapes available from the National Weather Records Center of the NWS at Ashe­ville, North Carolina. These tapes contain card images of "NWS Card Deck 488, USWB Hourly Precipitation" and cost approximately \$200 per station for a 25 year record of hourly precipitation totals. (Similar tapes are supplied in Canada by the Atmospheric Environment Service.) When snowmelt is simu­lated, a record of daily temperature data is also required; see the snowmelt documentation in Appendix II. These data are processed in subroutine CTRAIN in Runoff for later use by the other routines in the block. Optionally, the processed data, including a tabulation of the 50 highest values, may be exam­ined prior to proceeding with the remainder of the simulation. When snowmelt is simulated, rainfall or snowfall is determined from hourly air temperatures synthesized from the daily max-min values for the station. Snowfall values are keyed as negative precipitation for internal use in the program.
>
> Other input data unique to continuous simulation consist mainly of dates for starting and stopping, printing, etc. In addition, NWS Station ID num­bers must be known for the precipitation and temperature tapes.
>
> CATCHMENT SCHEMATIZATION
>
> Guidelines for subcatchment "lumping" or aggregation are given by Smith (1975) and Proctor and Redfern, Ltd. and James F. MacLaren, Ltd. (1976a, 1976b). In general, almost identical outlet hydrographs may be produced using only one subcatchment and one or no gutter/pipes as for a detailed schematization, using several subcatchments and gutter/pipes. A key param­eter to be adjusted is the subcatchment width. Quality comparisons may be more variable depending upon how the several land uses and/or pollutant loading rates are aggregated.
>
> OUTPUT
>
> <u>Runoff Block</u>
>
> Output from single event simulation consists basically of hydrographs and pollutographs printed over the whole event at a specified interval of time steps (e.g., every time step). Continuous SWMM retains this option for up to five user-specified date intervals. In addition, daily, monthly, annual and grand total values for runoff, precipitation and pollutant loads are provided. Daily totals are printed whenever there is runoff and/or pre­cipitation.
>
> In addition, the 50 highest hourly totals are listed, by both runoff volume and BOD load. These may be compared to the 50 highest hourly rainfall depths and used in selecting critical time periods for more detailed study.
>
> 369 I-3
>
> **For example, a two-year simulation of a 312 ac (126 ha) catchment tributary to Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis was made, and the ten highest rainfall, runoff and BOD loads (from the output of the 50 highest) are shown in Table I-1. The comparisons indicate that the rankings differ according to antecedent conditions, etc. affecting each parameter. For example, the highest rainfall depth corresponds to the third highest runoff depth and second highest BOD load. The table adds further justification to the contention that it is necessary to treat rainfall, runoff and pollutant loads separately in terms of statistical analyses.**
>
> **The most useful review of continuous SWMM output is probably accomplished using the Statistics Block. Therein a frequency analysis of many storm quan­tity and quality parameters (e.g., depth, duration, interevent time, load, peak concentration, etc.) may be performed. Output is available in both tabular and graphical forms. Analysis by the Statistics Block may follow** any other block (except Receive).
>
> <u>Storage/Treatment Block</u>
>
> There is no distinction made between output for a single event or con­tinuous simulation in the Storage/Treatment Block. Regardless of the number of time steps specified, the user has the option of printing a detailed report for each time step during eight different intervals (or less), a monthly summary, an annual summary, and/or a final summary. Of course, the monthly and annual summaries have little value in a single event simulation and should only be used for long-term runs.
>
> DRY-PERIOD REGENERATION  
> <u>Quantity</u>
>
> Infiltration capacity is regenerated during dry periods assuming an ex­ponential "drying curve" analogous to the "wetting curve" of Horton's equa­tion (see Appendix V). Monthly evaporation totals are used to regenerate depression storage on both pervious and impervious areas and are also con­sidered an initial "loss" for each time step with rainfall. Computations are bypassed during dry periods if infiltration and depression storage re­generation is complete.
>
> <u>Quality</u>
>
> Pollutant loadings on the subcatchment surfaces are regenerated during dry time steps (i.e, no runoff) depending upon how they are input initially. Linear or non-linear buildup may be used, with or without an upper limit. If desired, a rating curve (load versus flow) may be used instead of a washoff equation.
>
> Street sweeping occurs at intervals specified for each land use. The intervals are computed on the basis of intervening dry time steps. A dry time step is one in which the subcatchment receives no precipitation and has no water remaining in impervious area depression storage or as snow. When suowmelt is simulated, street sweeping may be bypassed for a specified

> CONTINUOUS SWIM COMPARED TO STORM
>
> Preliminary comparisons of SWMM and STORM, without S/T simulation, in­dicate that the two outputs are comparable and STORM is approximately 50 percent cheaper (see Appendix II). Why, then, might SWMM be used over STORM or other existing continuous models? When just the Runoff Block is required, STORM could be the choice because of its simplicity, good documentation, useful output and inclusion of the SCS method for rural runoff generation. SWMM might be preferred if flow routing in gutter/pipes were desired or par­ticular features of runoff or quality generation were needed. In addition, SWMM now couples both the single event and continuous simulation capability into one model.
>
> The principal advantage of continuous SWMM lies in its Storage/Treat-ment block described in Appendix IV. Several pathways among and through the various storage and/or treatment devices may be utilized instead of one fixed configuration. Most importantly, the treatment that occurs in storage as well as sludge generation by all control options, may be simulated by SWMM. Finally, SWMM S/T will compute operation and maintenance costs on the basis of actual hours of operation of wet-weather treatment devices, providing more realistic cost data.

APPENDIX II

SWMM SNOWMELT ROUTINES

INTRODUCTION

Snowmelt is an additional mechanism by which urban runoff may ***be*** gener­ated. Although flow rates are typically low, they may be sustained over several days and remove a significant fraction of pollutants deposited dur­ing the winter. Rainfall events superimposed upon snowmelt baseflow may produce higher runoff peaks and volumes as well as add to the melt rate of the snow.

In the context of long term, continuous simulation, runoff and pollu­tant loads are distributed quite differently in time between the cases when snowmelt is and is not simulated. The water and pollutant storage that occurs during winter months in colder climates cannot be simulated without including snowmelt.

Several hydrologic models include snowmelt computations, e.g., Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), HSPF (Johanson et al., 1980), NWS (Anderson, 1973, 1976), STORM (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1977, Roesner et al., 1974) and SSARR (Corps of Engineers, 1971). Of these exam­ples, only HSPF and STORM include pollutant routing options. Useful summa­ries of snowmelt modeling techniques are available in texts by Fleming (1975), Eagleson (1970), Linsley et al. (1975), Viessman et al. (1977), and Gray (1970). All of these draw upon the classic work, <u>Snow Hydrology,</u> of the Corps of Engineers (1956).

As part of a broad program of testing and adaptation to Canadian condi­tions, a snowmelt routine was placed is SWMM for single event simulation by Proctor and Redfern, Ltd. and James F. MacLaren, Ltd., abbreviated PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b, 1977), during 1974-1976. The basic melt computations were based on routines developed by the U. S. National Weather Service, NWS (Anderson, 1973). The work reported herein has utilized the Canadian SWMM snowmelt routines as a starting point and has considerably augmented their capabilities as well as added the facility for snowmelt computations while running continuous SWMM. In addition, features have been added which aid in adapting the snowmelt process to urban conditions since most efforts in the past, except for STORM, have been aimed at simulation of spring melt in large river basins. The work of the National Weather Service (Anderson, 1973) has also been heavily utilized, especially for the extension to continuous simu­lation and the resulting inclusion of cold content, variable melt coefficients and areal depletion.

> The following sections describe the methodology presently programmed in the SWMM Runoff Block. It is intended to aid in understanding the various input parameters required, computations performed, and output produced.
>
> OVERVIEW  
> <u>E-w Dcpths</u>
>
> Throughout the program, all snow depths are treated as "depth of water equivalent" to avoid specification of the specific gravity of the snow pack which is highly variable with time. The specific gravity of new snow is on the order of 0.09; an 11:1 or 10:1 ratio of snow pack depth to water equiva­lent depth is often used as a rule of thumb. With time, the pack compresses until the specific gravity can be considerably greater, to 0.5 and above. In urban areas, lingering snow piles may resemble ice more than snow, with specific gravities approaching 1.0. Although snow pack heat conduction and storage depend on specific gravity, sufficient accuracy may be obtained without using it. It is adequate to maintain continuity through the use of &loth of water equivalent.
>
> Most input parameters are in units of inches of water equivalent (in. w.e.). For all computations, conversions are made to feet of water equiva­lent.
>
> <u>Single Event Simulation</u>
>
> For single event simulation, it is unnecessary to generate a long rec­ord of precipitation and temperature data. Snow quantities are input as initial depths (water equivalent) on subcatchments and as negative rainfall intensities on rainfall input cards. Snowfall is generally keyed as nega­tive precipitation on input files. TeTperature data are read for each time step from card input. (Other parameters are explained subsequently.)
>
> During the simulation, melt is generated at each time step using a degree-day type equation during dry weather and Anderson's NWS equation (1973) during rainfall periods. Specified, constant areas of each sub-catchment are designated as snow covered. Melt, after routing through the remaining snow pack, is combined with rainfall to form the spatially weighted "effective rainfall" for overland flow routing in the same manner as in the past.
>
> <u>Continuous Simulation</u>
>
> For continuous simulation, hourly precipitation depths from NWS magnet­ic tapes are utilized along with daily max-min temperatures from other NWS tapes. The latter are interpolated sinusoidally to produce hourly tempera­ture values, as explained in detail in the next subsection. If temperatures are below a dividing value (e.g., 32°F), precipitation values are treated as snow and keyed with a negative sign. The hourly temperatures are also used in the melt computations.
>
> 374 11-2
>
> Melt is again generated using a degree-day type equation during dry weather and Anderson's NWS equation during rainfall periods. In addition, a record of the cold content of the snow is maintained. Thus, before melt can occur, the pack must be "ripened", that is, heated to a specified base tem­perature.
>
> One partition of the urban subcatchment is the "normally bare impervi­ous area." This is intended to represent surfaces such as streets, parking lots and sidewalks which are subject to plowing or snow "redistribution". The program includes this feature.
>
> Following the practice of melt computations in natural basins, "areal depletion curves" describe the spatial extent of snow cover as the pack melts. For instance, shaded areas would be expected to retain a snow cover longer than exposed areas. Thus, the snow covered area of each subcatchment changes with time during continuous simulation.
>
> Melt computations themselves proceed as in the single event simulation, except that the degree-day melt coefficients vary sinusoidally, from a maxi­mum on June 21 to a minimum on December 21.
>
> <u>Pollutant Simulation</u>
>
> Pollutant washoff is simulated as in the past using combined runoff from snowmelt and/or rainfall. For continuous SWMM, regeneration of any pollutant may depend upon whether snow cover is present if, for example, chlorides are to be simulated.
>
> SNOW AND TEMPERATURE GENERATION FROM NWS TAPES  
> <u>National Weather Service (NWS) Data</u>
>
> As explained in the description, continuous SWMM and other continuous simulation models utilize long-term precipitation and temperature data ob­tained from the National Weather Records Center (NWRC) at Asheville, North Carolina for the nearest NWS or airport weather station of record. If snow-melt is not simulated only the precipitation tape is needed; hourly precipi­tation totals are included on it for every day with measureable precipita­tion, plus for the first day of each month whether or not there is precipi­tation. For continuous SWMM without snowmelt, all such hourly values are treated as rainfall.
>
> Maximum and minimum temperatures as well as several other meteorologi­cal parameters are given for every day of the year on the NWRC's "WBAN Summary of Day, Deck 345". A card is illustrated in Figure II-1. Only the ID number, date and max-min temperatures are used although other data may be useful for other purposes. Note that the five-digit ID number is not neces-sarily the same as for the hourly precipitation data. The program, in sub­routine CTRAIN, accesses a magnetic tape containing card images of data shown in Figure II-1. The unit number of the tape is input in the executive Block as NSCRAT(3).

> <u>Creation of Hourly Temperatures</u>
>
> **The ."WBAN Summary of Day" or temperature tape does not list the time of day at which the minimum and maximum temperatures occur. Hence, the minimum temperature is <u>assumed</u> to occur at sunrise each day, and the maximum is <u>assumed</u> to occur three hours prior to sunset. All times are rounded to the nearest hour. This scheme obviously cannot account for many meteorological phenomena that would create other temperature-time distributions but is apparently the most appropriate one under the** circumstances. Given the max-min temperatures and their assumed hours of occurrence, the other 22 hourly temperatures are readily created by sinusoidal interpolation, as sketched in Figure II-2. The interpolation is performed, using three differ­ent periods, **1)** between the maximum of the previous day and the minimum of the present, 2) between the minimum and maximum of the present, and 3) between the maximum of the present and minimum of the following.

> The time of day of sunrise and sunset are easily obtained as a function of latitude and longitude of the catchment and the date. Techniques for these computations are explained, for example, by List (1966) and by the TVA (1972). The program, in subroutine CTRAIN, utilizes approximate (but suffi­ciently accurate) formulas given in the latter reference. Their use is ex­plained briefly below.

> The hour angle of the sun, h, is the angular distance between the in­stantaneous meridian of the sun (i.e., the meridian through which passes a line from the center of the earth to the sun) and the meridian of the obser­ver (i.e., the meridian of the catchment). It may be measured in degrees or radians or readily converted to hours, since 24 hours is equivalent to 360 degrees or 2n radians. The hour angle is a function of latitude, declination of the earth and time of day and is zero at noon, true solar time, and posi­tive in the afternoon. However, at sunrise and sunset, the solar altitude of the sun (vertical angle of the sun measured from the earth's surface) is zero, and the hour angle is computed only as a function of latitude and dec­lination,

> **The hour of sunrise and sunset is symmetric about noon, true solar time. True solar noon occurs when the sun is at its highest elevation for the day. It differs from standard zone time, (i.e., the time on clocks) because of a longitude effect and because of the "equation of time". The latter is of astronomical origin and causes a correction that varies season­ally between approximately ± 15 minutes. It is neglected here. The longi­tude correction accounts for the time difference due to the separation of the meridian of** the observer and the meridian of the standard time zone. These are listed in Table II-1. It is readily computed as

> Note that DTLONG can be either positive or negative, and the sign should be retained. For instance, Boston at approximately 71°W has DTLONG = -16 min­utes, meaning that mean solar noon precedes EST noon by 16 minutes. (Mean solar time differs from true solar time by the neglected "equation of time".)

Snowfall totals are generally underestimated as a result, by a factor that varies considerably depending upon gage exposure, wind velocity and whether or not the gage has a wind shield. The program includes a parameter, SCF, which multiplies snow depths only, as computed using equation II-7. Although it will vary considerably from storm to storm, it acts as a mean correction factor over a season in the model. Anderson (1973) provides typical values of SCF as a function of wind speed, as shown in Figure II-3, which may be helpful in establishing an initial estimate. The value of SCF can also be used to account for other factors, such as losses of snow due to interception and sublimation not accounted for in the model. Anderson (1973) states that both losses are usually small compared to the gage catch deficiency.**

**<u>Single Event SWMM</u>**

**NWS tapes are not used, nor is subroutine CTRAIN called for single event simulation. Precipitation is entered on cards as in the past. However, snowfall can be included, if desired, as a negative precipitation value at any time step.**

**SUBCATCHMENT SCIfEMATIZATION**

**<u>Land Surface - Snow Cover Combinations</u>**

**In order to have flexibility in treating different combinations of snow cover and ground surface types, four such combinations are provided, as described in Table II-2 and illustrated in Figure II-5. When snowmelt is not simulated, only the first three are used, as in the past. (Type 3, impervious area with no depression storage, is specified in Runoff by the parameter PCTZER, percent of impervious area with immediate runoff.) Snow cover is treated identically on types 1 and 3 since these surfaces are likely to be of a similar nature, e.g., streets, sidewalks, parking lots, etc. For continuous simulation, these surfaces are considered "normally bare" because of probable plowing, salting or other rapid snow removal, but are subject to snow cover also, as described subsequently. For single event simulation, these surfaces are always bare; all snow on' impervious areas is handled in type 4.**

**In Runoff, especially subroutine WSHED, the "types" are subscripts for the parameter WDEPTH, the water depth on each surface type. Since snow cover is the same for types 1 and 3, snow depths, WSNOW, are only triply subscripted.**

**For single event simulation, the fraction of snow covered pervious area is constant; for continuous simulation the fraction varies according to an areal depletion curve (as for type 4 impervious). The depletion curves are explained in a following subsection.**

> **384 11-12**
>
> **Apportionment of impervious area is different when simulating with and without snowmelt. For the latter situation, the area with zero depression storage (type 3) is taken as a percentage, PCTZER, of the total impervious area. For the former situation (with snowmelt), it is taken as a percentage, the same PCTZER, of the bare impervious area (single event simulation) or of the "normally bare" impervious area (continuous simulation). Thus, the type 3 area will vary according to whether snowmelt is simulated or not, as shown** in Figure 11-5. The effect on outflow is very minor. The fraction of imper­vious area with 100 percent snow cover (single event) or subject to an areal depletion curve (continuous) is an input parameter, SNN1, for each subcatch-ment.

> **Snow removal practices form a major difference between the snow hydrol­ogy of urban and rural areas. Much of the snow cover may be completely removed from heavily urbanized areas, or plowed into windrows or piles, with melt characteristics that differ markedly from those of undisturbed snow. Management practices in cities vary according to location, climate, topogra­phy and the storm itself; they are summarized in a study by APWA (1974). It is probably not possible to treat them all in a simulation model. However, in continuous SWMM, provision is made for approximate simulation of some practices.**

All snow in excess of this depth, say 0.1 - 0.2 in. water equivalent (2.5 - 5.1 mm), is redistributed to other areas according to five fractions, SFRAC, input for each subcatchment. These are described on Figure II-6. For instance, if snow is usually windrowed onto adjacent impervious or pervious areas, SFRAC(1) or SFRAC(2) may be used. If it is trucked to another subcatchment, (the last one input is used for this purpose), a fraction SFRAC(3) will so indicate, or SFRAC(4) if the snow is removed entirely from the simulated watershed. In the latter case, such removals are tabulated and included in the final continuity check. Finally, excess snow may be immediately "melted", (i.e., treated as rainfall), using SFRAC(5). The transfers are area weighted, of course, and the five fractions should sum to 1.0. A depth of snow WEPLOW remains on the normally bare area and is subject to melting as on the other areas. See Table II-3 for guide­lines as to typical levels of service for snow and ice control (Richardson et al., 1974).

> <u>Array Restrictions</u>

> In an attempt to maintain a manageable size of the Runoff Block, con­tinuous SWNN is limited to 30 subcatchments and 30 inlets because several additional parameters are needed. However, this should be more than ade­quate for continuous simulation, with and without snowmelt, since only a coarse catchment discretization should be sufficient. Limitations for single event SWHN remain at 200 subcatchments and 200 gutter/pipes plus inlets.

<u>Snowpack Heat Budget</u> --

Heat may be added or removed from a snowpack by the following processes:

> 1\. Absorbed solar radiation (addition).
>
> Nat langwave radiation exchange with the surrounding environment (addition or removal).

3.  Convective transfer of sensible heat from air (addition or removal).

4.  Release of latent heat of vaporization by condensate (addition) or, the opposite, its removal by sublimation (removing the latent heat of vaporization plus the latent heat of fusion).

5.  Advection of heat by rain (addition) plus addition of the heat of fusion if the rain freezes.

6.  Conduction of heat from underlying ground (removal or addition).

The terms nay be summed, with appropriate signs, and equated to the change of heat stored in the snowpack to form a conservation of heat equa­tion. Refer to Appendix III for further detail. All of the processes listed above vary in relative importance with topography, season, climate, local meteorological conditions, etc., but items 1-4 are the most important. Item 5 is of less importance on a seasonal basis, and item 6 is often neglected.

A snowpack is termed "ripe" when any additional heat will produce liquid runoff. Rainfall (item 5) will rapidly ripen a snowpack by release of its latent heat of fusion as it freezes in subfreezing snow, followed by quickly filling the free water holding capacity of the snow.

<u>Melt Prediction Techniques</u> --

Prediction of melt follows from prediction of the heat storage of the snow pack. "Energy budget" techniques are the most exact formulation since they evaluate each of the heat budget terms individually, requiring as mete­orologic input **quantities such as solar radiation, air temperature, dew** point or relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Assumptions must be made about the density, surface roughness and heat and water storage (mass balance) of the snow pack as well as on related topographical and vegetative parameters. Further complications arise in dealing with heat conduction and roughness of the underlying ground and whether or not it is permeable.

Several models treat individually some or all of these effects. One of the more recent was developed for the NWS river forecast system by Anderson (1976). Interestingly, under many conditions, he found that results obtained using his energy balance model were not significantly better than those ob­tained using simpler (e.g., degree-day or temperature-index) techniques in **his** earlier model (1973). The more open and variable the conditions, the

> 390 **11-18**
>
> **better** is the energy balance technique. Closest agreement between his two models was for heavily forested watersheds.
>
> Minimal data ***needed*** to apply an energy balance model are a good esti­mate of incoming solar radiation, plus measurements of air temperature, vapor pressure (or dew point or relative humidity) and wind speed. All of these data, except possibly solar radiation, are available at at least one location (e.g., the airport) for almost all reasonably sized cities. Even solar radi­ation measurements are taken at several locations in most states. Predictive techniques are also available, for solar radiation and other parameters, based on available measurements (TVA, 1972, Franz, 1974).
>
> <u>Choice of Predictive Method</u> --
>
> Two major reasons suggest that simpler, e.g., temperature-index, tech­niques should be used for simulation of snowmelt and accumulation in urban areas. First, even though required meteorologic data for energy balance models are likely to be available, there is a large local variation in the magnitude of these parameters due to the urbanization itself. For example, radiation melt will be influenced heavily by shading of buildings and
>
> reduced albedo caused by urban pollutants. In view of the many unknown pro­perties of the snowpack itself in urban areas, it may be overly ambitious to attempt to predict melt at all! But at the least, simpler techniques are probably all that are warranted. They have the added advantage of consider­ably reducing the already extensive input data to a model such as SWMM.
>
> Second, the objective of the modeling should be examined. Although it may contribute, snowmelt seldom causes flooding or hydrologic extremes in an urban area itself. Hence, exact prediction of flow magnitudes does not as­sume nearly the importance it has in the models of, say, the NWS, in which river flood forecasting is of paramount importance. For continuous simula­tion and planning purposes in urban areas, exact quantity (or quality) pre­diction is not the objective in any event; rather, these efforts produce a statistical evaluation of a complex system and help identify critical time periods for more detailed analysis.
>
> For these and other reasons, simple snowmelt prediction techniques have been incorporated into SWMM. In their literature review preparatory to sim­ilar earlier work, Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren (1976a, 1976b) felt that Anderson's NWS (1973) temperature-index method was most appropriate for SWMM. It is also well documented and tested, and has been incorporated into the SWMM version described herein. As described subsequently, the snow-melt modeling follows Anderson's work in several areas, not just in the melt equations. The energy budget technique is illustrated in this report, how­ever, in Appendix III, in order to show how it reduces to a temperature-index equation under certain assumptions. It may be noted that the STORM model (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1977, Roesner et al., 1974) also uses the temperature-index method for snowmelt prediction, in a considerably less complex manner than is now programmed in SWMM.

**<u>SWMM Melt Equations</u>**

**Anderson's NWS model (1973) treats two different melt situations: with and without rainfall. When there is rainfall (greater than 0.1 in./6 hr or 2.5 mm/6 hr in the NWS model, greater than 0.02 in./hr or 0.51 mm/hr in SWMM), accurate assumptions may be made about several energy budget terms. These are: zero solar radiation, incoming longwave radiation equals blackbody r<sup>."4."-"</sup>n at the ambient air temperature, the snow surface temperature is 32°F (0°C), and the dew point and rain water temperatures equal the ambient air temperature. Anderson combines the appropriate terms for each heat budget component into one equation for the melt rate. As used in subroutine MELT in SWMM, it is**

Values of TBASE will probably range between 25 and 32 °F (-4 and 0°C).

In urban areas, values may tend toward the higher part of the range due to compression of the pack by vehicles, pedestrians, windrows, etc. Again, there appear to be few data available to produce accurate estimates. However, Bengston (1981) and Westerstrom (1981) do describe preliminary results of urban snowmelt studies in Sweden, including degree-day coefficients which range from 3 to 8 mm/°C-day (0.007 - 0.17 in./°F-day).**

> **<u>Heat Exchange Haring Nou-Melt Periods</u>**
>
> **During subfreezing weather, the snow pack does not melt, and heat ex­change with the atmosphere can either warm or cool the pack. The difference between the heat content of the subfreezing pack and the (higher) base melt temperature is taken as positive and termed the "cold content" of the pack. No melt will occur until this quantity, COLDC in SWMM, is reduced to zero. It is maintained in inches (or feet) of water equivalent. That is, a cold content of 0.1 in. (2.5 mm) is equivalent to the heat required to melt 0.1 in. (2.5 mm) of snow. Following Anderson (1973), the heat exchange altering the cold content is proportional to the difference between the air tempera­ture, TA, and an antecedent temperature index, ATI, indicative of the temper­ature of the surface layer of the snow pack. The revised value of ATI at time step 2 is calculated as**

> **The weighting factor, TIPM, is an indication of the thickness of the "surface" layer of snow. Values of TIPM less than 0.1 give significant weight to temperatures over the past week or more and would thus indicate a deeper layer than TIPM values greater than, say, 0.5 which would essentially only give weight to temperatures during the past day. In other words, the pack will both warm and cool more slowly with low values of TIPM. Anderson states that TIPM = 0.5 has given reasonable results in natural watersheds,**
>
> **394 11-22**

**although there is some evidence that a lower value may be more appropriate. No calibration has been attempted on urban watersheds.**

**Following computation of the antecedent temperature index, the cold content is changed by an amount**

> **At = time step, sec.**

**Note that the cold content is increased, (ACOLDC is positive) when the air temperature is less (colder) than the antecedent temperature index. Since heat transfer during non-melt periods is less than during melt periods, Anderson uses a "negative melt coefficient" in the heat exchange computation. SWMM computes this simply as a fraction, RNM, of the melt coefficient, DHM. Hence, the negative melt coefficient, i.e., the product RHM • DHM, also varies seasonally. A typical value of RNM is 0.6.**

**When heat is added to a snow pack with zero cold content, liquid melt is produced, but runoff does not occur, until the "free water holding capa­city" of the snow pack is filled. This is discussed subsequently. For single event SWMM no cold content calculations are performed; values of COLDC are assumed to equal zero throughout the simulation. The value of COLDC is in units of feet of water equivalent over the area in question. The cold content "volume", equivalent to calories or BTU's is obtained by multiplying by the area. Finally, an adjustment is made to equation II-16 depending on the areal extent of snow cover. This is discussed below.**

**<u>Areal Extent of Snow Cover  
Introduction</u> --**

**The snow pack on a catchment rarely melts uniformly over the total area. Rather, due to shading, drifting, topography, etc., certain portions of the catchment will become bare before others, and only a fraction, ASC, will be snow covered. This fraction must be known in order to compute the snow covered area available for heat exchange and melt, and to know how much rain falls on bare ground. Because of year to year similarities in topography, vegetation, drift patterns, etc., the fraction, ASC, is primarily only a function of the amount of snow on the catchment at a given time; this func­tion, called an "areal depletion curve", is discussed below. These functions are used only for continuous SWMM to describe the seasonal growth and reces­sion of the snow pack. For single event simulation, fractions of snow covered area are fixed for the pervious and impervious areas of each subcatchment.**

**396 11-24**

> **<u>Areal Depletion Curves</u> --**
>
> **The functional dependence of the areal depletion curve, ADC, has just been described. As used in most snowmelt models, it is assumed that there is a depth, SI, above which there will always *be* 100 percent cover. In some models, the value of SI is adjusted during the simulation; in SWMM it remains constant. The amount of snow present at any time is indicated by the param­eter WGNOW, which** is **Cue depth (water equivalent) over each of the three possible snow covered areas of each subcatchment, (see Figure II-5). This depth is nondimensionalized by SI for use in calculating ASC. Thus, an areal depletion curve is a plot of WSNOW/SI versus ASC; a typical ADC for a natural catchment is shown in Figure II-8. For values of the ratio AWESI = WSNOW/SI greater than 1.0, ASC = 1.0, that is, the area is 100 percent snow covered.**

drifting might provide such a mechanism; in urban areas, plowing and wind­rowing could cause a similar effect. A complex curve could be generated to represent specific snow removal practices in a city. However, the program utilizes only one ADC curve for all impervious areas (e.g., area A4 of Figure II-5 for all subcatchments) and only one ADC curve for all pervious areas (e.g., area A2 of Figure II-5 for all subcatchments). This limitation should not hinder an adequate simulation since the effects of variations in individ­ual locations are averaged out in the city-wide scope of most continuous simulations.

The two ADC curves for pervious and impervious areas are input by the user, as are values of SI for each subcatchment. The program does not require the ADC curves to pass through the origin, AWESI=ASC=0; they may intersect the abscissa at a value of ASC \> 0 in order to maintain some snow covered area up until the instant that all snow disappears (see Figure II-8). However, the curves may not intersect the ordinate, AWESI \> 0 when ASC = O.

The preceding paragraphs have centered on the situation where a depth of snow greater than or equal to SI has fallen and is melting. (The ADC curves are not employed until WSNOW becomes less than SI.) The situation when there is new snow needs to be discussed, starting from both zero or non-zero initial cover. The SWMM procedure again follows Anderson's NWS method (1973).

When there is new snow and WSNOW is already greater than or equal to SI, then ASC remains unchanged at 1.0. However, when there is new snow on bare or partially bare ground, it is assumed that the total area is 100 per­cent covered for a period of time, and a "temporary" ADC is established as shown in Figure II-8. This temporary curve returns to the same point on the ADC as the snow melts. Let the depth of new snow be SNO, measured in equi­valent feet of water. Then the value of AWESI will be changed from an ini­tial value of AWE to a *new* value of SNEW by

> SNEW = AWE + SNO/SI (II-20)

It is assumed that the areal snow cover remains at 100 percent until 25 per­cent of the new snow melts. This defines the value of SBWS of Figure II-8 as

> SBWS = AWE + 0.75 • ANO/SI (II-21)

Anderson (1973) reports low sensitivity of model results to the arbitrary 25 percent assumption. When melt produces a value of AWESI between SBWS and AWE, linear interpolation of the temporary curve is used to find ASC until. the actual ADC curve is again reached. When new snow has fallen, the pro­gram thus maintains values of AWE, SBA and SBWS.

The interactive nature of melt and fraction of snow cover is not accounted for <u>during</u> each time step. It is sufficient to use the value of ASC at the beginning of each time step, especially with the short one-hour time step used for the simulation.

> <u>Use of Value of</u> ASC --
>
> The fraction of area that is snow covered, ASC, is *used* to adjust 1) the volume of melt that occurs, and 2) the "volume" of cold content change, since it is assumed that heat transfer occurs only over the snow covered area. The melt rate is computed from either equation II-8 or equation II-13. The snow depth is then reduced from its value at time step 1 to time step 2

>
> <u>Liquid Water Routing in Snow Pack</u>
>
> Production of melt does not necessarily mean that there will be liquid runoff at a given time step since a snow pack, acting as a porous medium with a "porosity", has a certain "free water holding capacity" at a given instant in time. Following PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b), this capacity is taken as a constant fraction, FWFRAC, of the variable snow depth, WSNOW, at each time step. This volume (depth) must be filled before runoff from the snow pack occurs. The program maintains the depth of free water, FW, ft of water, for use in these computations. When FW = FWFRAC • WSNOW, the snow pack is fully ripe. The procedure is sketched in Figure II-10.
>
> The inclusion of the free water holding capacity via this simple reser­voir-type routing delays and somewhat attenuates the appearance of liquid runoff. The value of FWFRAC will normally be less than 0.10 and usually between 0.02 - 0.05 for deep snow packs (WSNOW \> 10 in. or 254 mm water equivalent). However, Anderson (1973) reports that a value of 0.25 is not unreasonable for shallow snow packs that may form a slush layer. When rain­fall occurs, it is added to the melt rate entering storage as free water. No free water **is** released when melt does not occur, but remains in storage, available for release when the pack is again ripe. This re-frozen free water is not included in subsequent cold content or melt computations.
>
> <u>Net Runoff</u>

>
> If immediate melt is produced through the use of the snow redistribu­tion fraction S7RAC(5), discussed earlier (see Figure II-6), it is added to equation II-24. Furthermore, all melt calculations are ended when the depth of snow water equivalent becomes less than 0.001 in. (0.025 mm), and remain­ing snow and free water are converted to immediate melt and added to equa­tion II-24.
>
> <u>Effect of Snow on Infiltration and Surface Parameters</u>
>
> A snow pack tends to insulate the surface beneath it. If ground has frozen prior to snowfall, it will tend to remain so, even as the snow begins to melt. Conversely, unfrozen ground is generally not frozen by subsequent snowfall. The infiltration characteristics of frozen versus unfrozen ground are not well understood and depend upon the moisture content at the time of freezing. For these and other reasons, SWMM assumes that snow has no effect on infiltration or other parameters, such as surface roughness or detention storage (although the latter is altered in a sense through the use of the free water holding capacity of the snow). In addition, all heat transfer calculations cease when the water becomes "net runoff". Thus, water in tem­porary surface storage during the overland flow routing will not refreeze as the temperature drops and is also subject to evaporation beneath the snow pack.

> QUALITY INTERACTIONS  
> <u>Pollutant Accumulation  
> Snowmelt Quality</u> --
>
> A detailed review of literature related to snowmelt quality is given by PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b). Among the various contaminants found in deposited snow and melt water, chlorides and lead appear to be the most serious and potentially hazardous. Chloride concentrations in runoff along major high­ways can be higher than 20,000 mg/1, with typical values of from 1,000 to 10,000 mg/l. Several other studies also document chloride contamination and discuss street salting practices (Field et al., 1973, Richardson et al., 1974, Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 1974). Lead concentrations in snow windrows have been as high as 100 mg/1 with typical values of from 1 to 10 mg/l. However, most deposited lead results from automobile combustion and is insoluble. Hence, melt runoff concentrations are lower than snow pack values and are mostly associated with suspended solids.

**<u>Pollutant Loadings</u> --**

**Mechanisms and modeling alternatives for pollutant buildup and washoff are described extensively in Section 4 (Runoff Block). Any parameter**

**related to snowmelt may be generated using linear or non-linear buildup, or else a rating curve (load proportional to flow). Specifically, street salt­ing chemicals may be simulated, such as sodium chloride or calcium chloride.**

**<u>Adjustments for Presence of Snow</u> --**

**As a user option, regeneration of any quality constituent may be per­formed only when snow is present. This option is indicated by parameter LINKUP. Thus, if chlorides are simulated, for example, they will not be re­generated from bare ground, during the summer months for instance. However, regeneration when it does occur is a function only if the snow is present, not the actual <u>amount</u> (depth).**

**<u>Possible Loading Rates</u> --**

**Pollutant loading rates are best determined from local data. The lite-ature review of PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b) may also be consulted for tables that may be used to estimate loading rate parameters for snow-associated pollu­tants. Other references will also be useful (e.g., Field et al., 1973, Richardson et a\].., 1974, Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 1974).**

**Table II-4 (Richardson et al, 1974) lists <u>recommended</u> deicing chemical application rates for roadways. In general, PR-JFM show that <u>observed</u> load­ing rates are functions of population density with suburban rates lower than arterial highway rates, as indicated in Table II-5. This is also true for other pollutants.**

**<u>Street Sweeping</u>**

**Simulation of street sweeping in SWMM is performed as in the past, except: for slight modifications as described in Section 4. The effect of snow is included in two minor ways. First, beginning and ending dates, parameters KLNBGN and KLNEND respectively, may be input for continuous SWMM to indicate**

> **405 11-33**
>
> **the interval during the year subject to street sweeping. If sweeping normally is not done between, say, December 1 and March 1, because of high snow volumes, this may be so indicated.**
>
> **Second, the presence of snow can alter the street sweeping interval. These intervals are specified for each of the five land uses. Each sub-catchment is swept when the number of <u>dry</u> time steps for that subcatchment exceeds the interval for the given land use. A dry time step, in subroutine QSHED, is one in which there is no precipitation and no water or snow on areas Al and A3 (Figure II-S). Thus, subcatchments will not be swept until there is no snow or water on "normally bare" impervious areas.**
>
> **<u>Other Considerations</u>**
>
> **The snow itself is assumed to be "pure" and contain no pollutants.**
>
> **Thus, the redistribution or transfers of snow described earlier (Figure II-6) will not remove accumulated pollutants. This is partially justified on the basis of the assumption that such transfers would occur soon after fresh snow has fallen. They occur during the same time step in the model.**
>
> **Although not well tested, it is assumed that the principal effect of inclusion of snowmelt upon runoff quality predictions of continuous SWMM will be to shift the season and magnitude of pollutant washoff. There will tend to be fewer periods of washoff during the winter. As snowmelt, equivalent melt rates are likely to be less than the usual magnitude of rainfall inten­sities experienced. Hence, concentrations may tend to be more uniform during the melt washoff events.**
>
> **DATA REQUIREMENTS  
> <u>New Parameters </u>**
>
> **The revised Runoff Block input data formats should be examined for the new snowmelt variables. For single event simulation these include watershed elevation, free water holding capacities, air temperatures and wind speeds, and for each subcatchment, snow covered fractions, initial snow and free water, melt coefficients and base temperatures. Continuous simulation requires the same data as above, except that air temperatures are computed using other input parameters. In addition, it requires the snow gage cor­rection factor, negative heat exchange parameter, areal depletion curves, and, for each subcatchment, the redistribution parameters. Of course, for continuous simulation, the required parameters can be kept to a minimum by keeping the number of subcatchments used to a minimum (e.g., one). Also required are pollutant loading data that may or may not be related to snow.**
>
> **<u>Sensitivity</u>**
>
> **The melt routines have not been sufficiently tested to date to quantify the sensitivity of results to various input parameters. It is expected that melt volumes will be most related to the precipitation record, of course, and to the gage correction factor, which influences the amount of snow that**

> **falls. Melt rates will be influenced by the melt coefficients and base tem­peratures, and, to some degree, by the areal depletion curves which simulate the relative "piling" or "stacking" of the snow.**

**APPENDIX III**

**REDUCTION OF ENERGY BALANCE EQUATION TO DEGREE-DAY EQUATION**

> **PURPOSE**
>
> **This appendix presents equations that can be used for each term in the energy balance equation discussed in Appendix II. The equation is then lin­earized and typical numerical values are used to reduce it to a degree-day or temperature-index type equation. The energy budget method will thus *be* better understood, and a physical basis for the simple prediction equations will be seen. Notation and equations used will follow Eagleson (1970), al­though an identical development could he based nn several other references.**

> **ENERGY BUDGET**
>
> **The energy budget given in Appendix II is repeated and symbols are assigned to each term. Units for each energy buqet term will be energy/ area-time, e.g., ly/day (one langley = one cal/cm ). However, within this scope, there will be mixtures of units used as convenient, e.g., minutes and days, °C and °F. The equation will ultimately *be* converted to U.S. custom­ary units.**

**The factor of 8.5 in equation III-10 accounts for the fact that when the snow pack is ripe, the latent heat of condensation will supply the latent heat of fusion to melt the snow.

**The low value of T<sub>u</sub> of about 9°F implies sufficient energy input (via solar radiation and condensation) to cause melt even at low temperatures. This is not really true, however, since the melt equation was linearized about a temperature of 35°F and should only *be* used in that range. The exercise serves to indicate the range of values that may be found when sub­stituting actual meteorological data iato the equations. Although seem­ingly wrong values may result, e.g., base melt temperatures less than zero, the equation with such values is still valid for the input parameters used and over the range of the linearization.**

> STORAGE/TREATMENT SIMULATION
>
> OBJECTIVES
>
> The primary objectives of the Storage/Treatment Block are to:

1.  provide the capability of modeling a larger number of processes in both the single event and continuous modes;

2.  simulate the quality improvement provided by each process;

3.  simulate the handling of sludges; and

> provide estimates of capital, operation and maintenance costs.
>
> Although the objectives of the Storage/Treatment Block have not changed appreciably from earlier versions (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a), the model has been virtually rewritten. The earlier versions were more limited in use and scope. This version is much more flexible in terms of the control units available, pollutant routing and cost estimating. However, the user is advised that increased flexibility implies increased user input and knowledge of the processes to be modeled. In other words, the model does not provide several dozen specialized designs, but provides the tools necessary to simu­late the desired processes. Naturally, flexibility precludes ultrasophisti-cation.
>
> Several precautions should be noted before setting up the S/T Block.

1.  Local waste characterization data are essential to appraise realisti­cally the performance of treatment units.

2.  Lab or pilot plant performance data should be used whenever possible to derive performance functions.

3.  Dry-weather treatment performance functions should be applied cautious­ly to wet-weather units.

> PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND OVERVIEW  
> <u>Development</u>
>
> Past versions of the Storage/Treatment Block simulated various proces­ses on the basis of limited empirical data and operating experience. Often the data were localized and/or specialized. Thus, they were of questionable applicability to a wide variety of situations. Additionally, the model did not account for the physical characteristics of the incoming waste stream or the handling of residuals (sludges).
>
> 417 IV-1

To improve the storage/treatment modeling capabilities of SWMM the fol­lowing considerations were instrumental in creating a new model.

1.  There should be a high degree of flexibility in the simulation of in­dividual units and the interaction among units.

2.  In addition to simulating the mass of pollutants, it is important to account for the physical characteristics (i.e., particle size and spe--"" gravity distribution) of each pollutant.

3.  Residual (sludge) handling is an important part of any wastewater treatment scheme and should be simulated.

4.  All costing routines should be as flexible as the performance algorithms.

5.  The model should be capable of modeling wet- and dry-weather facilities.

<u>Overview</u>

The present Storage/Treatment Block is approximately 2000 Fortran state­ments in length and consists of eight subroutines. The routing of flow and nollutants thrnugh the entire block is controlled by subroutine STRT which is called from the Executive Block. STRT also provides the main driving loop for the model and generally acts as the central coordinating subroutine. Subroutine STRDAT is called in STRT and is responsible for reading the input data provided by the user. Subroutine CONTRL is called each time-step from the main driving loop in STRT. CONTRL directs flow and pollutants from one unit to another as prescribed by the desired scheme and coordinates the majority of the printed output. Subroutine UNIT is called from CONTRL for each unit modeled and is the heart of the Storage/Treatment Block. It con­tains the necessary flexibility and capability to model most storage/treat-ment processes (units). Subroutine EQUATE is used by UNIT to provide several forms of pollutant removal equations. Subroutine INTERP is employed by UNIT for linear interpolation. Subroutine PLUGS is used by UNIT to model perfect plug flow through a detention unit. Subroutine STCOST is called from STRT to determine capital and operation and maintenance costs.

The model has become user-intensive rather than program-intensive. The user is responsible for providing the program with the desired storage/treat-ment scheme and operating characteristics of each unit (along with other information). However, input guidelines are provided in the User's Manual for several types of units. Again, the strength of this approach is to maximize flexibility and applicability to local conditions and design criteria.

SIMULATION TECHNIQUES  
<u>Introduction</u>

Flow and pollutants are routed through one or more storage/treatment units by several techniques. The flows into, through and out of a unit are shown in Figure IV-1. The units may be arranged in any fashion, restricted only by the requirements that inflow to the plant enters at only one unit

and that the products (treated outflow, residuals, and bypass flow) from each unit not be directed to more than three units. Treatment and sludge handling units are modeled by the same subroutine (UNIT). Additionally, both wet-and dry-weather facilities may be simulated by the proper selection of unit arrangement and characteristics. Units may ***be*** modeled as having a detention capability or instantaneous throughflow. Pollutants or sludges may be repre­sented as mass only or further characterized by a particle size or settling velocity distribution. **A** unit may remove pollutants (or concentrate sludges) as a function of particle size and specific gravity, detention time, incoming concentration, the removal rate of another pollutant, or a constant percentage. The S/T Block can receive the flow and any three pollutants from any one outlet in any other block of SWMM. Also, flows and pollutants may be provided by the user and fed directly to the S/T Block. If both sources are present they are combined and treated as one input. For example, the user may enter directly dry-weather flows and enter wet-weather flows from the Runoff Block. All flows and pollutant concentrations reported by the S/T Block are average values over each time step. This is necessary for some of the algorithms in the S/T Block (in particular, the plug flow routines); it does not signifi­cantly affect the results.

The following sections describe the techniques available for flow and pollutant routing which allow the user to model several types of storage/ treatment units.

<u>Flow Routing</u>

<u>Detention vs. Instantaneous Throughflow</u>

--

A unit may be modeled to handle flow in one of two ways; as a detention unit (reservoir) or a unit instantaneously passing all flow. The idea of a detention unit is not limited to storage basins and sedimentation tanks but also includes such processes as dissolved air flotation, activated sludge, and chlorination. Processes that may be modeled as having instantaneous throughflow include microscreens, fine screens and other forms of screening.

<u>Detention Units</u> --

The rate of change of storage in a detention unit or reservoir is found by writing a mass balance equation for the system shown in Figure IV-2.

The data in Table IV-1 give 0<sub>2</sub> and 11,, as functions of depth. In this case, discharge or outflow occurs only if the reservoir depth exceeds 8.0 ft. The model uses these data to calculate the values of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At (column 7) and 0.50<sub>1</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub> (column 8) for each depth (defined in the model as 02DT2 and SATERM, respectively). Thus, the relationship required by equation IV-7 is indirectly generated. During the simulation, the value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub> is calculated by equation IV-6 and the corresponding value of 0.50<sub>1</sub>At found by linear interpolation through the previously generated set of 020T2 - SATERM values. The values of 0<sub>2</sub> and V are subsequently calculated. This proce­dure is repeated each time step<sup>2</sup>with the value of 0<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> becoming the values of 0<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> for use in equation IV-6 during the next time step. In a normal simulation the outflow<sub>,</sub> 0<sub>2,</sub> represents treated outflow, residual

> The computational procedure is summarized as follows:

1.  Known values of I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, 0<sub>1</sub>, it, and V<sub>1</sub> are substituted into the right hand side of equation IV-6. The result is the first value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub>.

2.  Knowing (0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub>) the value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At is obtained by interpola­ting between adjacent values of 02DT2 and SATERM.

3.  The values of V<sub>2</sub> and 0<sub>2</sub> are determined and become the values of V<sub>1</sub> and 0<sub>1,</sub> respectively, in the next time step.

4.  Add 0.5(I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>) At to the new value of V<sub>1</sub> - 0.50<sub>1</sub>At to get the new value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2.</sub>

5.  Continue this process until all inflows have been routed.

> Equation IV-11 is the basis for the complete mixing model of pollutant routing through a detention unit.
>
> Equations IV-9, IV-10, and IV-11 assume that pollutants are removed at a rate proportional to the concentration present in the unit. In other words, a first-order reaction is assumed. The coefficient K is the rate constant. The product of K and At is represented by the value of R in a user-supplied removal equation (See Equation IV-14 and accompanying discussion).
>
> Removed pollutant quantities are not allowed to accumulate in a completely-mixed detention unit. Strictly, pollutants cannot settle under such conditions. Therefore, the residual stream is effectively another route for treated outflow. All pollutant removal is assumed to occur by non-physical means (e.g., biological decomposition). Several processes such as flocculation and rapid-mix chlorination are essentially completely-mixed detention units.

> <u>Plug Flow</u> --
>
> If the user selects the plug flow option, the inflow during each time step, herein called a plug, is labeled and queued through the detention unit. Transfer of pollutants between plugs is not permitted. The outflow for any time step is comprised of the oldest plugs, and/or fractions thereof, present is the unit. This is accomplished by satisfying continuity for the present outflow volume (which was calculated earlier):

>
> JP = time step number of the oldest plug in the unit, and
>
> LP = time step number of the youngest plug required to satisfy continuity with V<sub>o</sub>.
>
> As in a completely-mixed detention unit, detention time is the most impor­tant indicator of pollutant removal ability. Removal equations are speci­fied by the user (see later discussion) and, in this case, should be written as a function of detention time (along with other possible parameters). The detention time for each plug j is calculated as
>
> (t<sub>d</sub>)<sub>j</sub> = (KKDT - j)At (IV-13)
>
> where KKDT = present time step number. The detention time is calculated in the same manner during dry- and wet-weather periods because the plugs always maintain their identity.
>
> Removed pollutant quantities accumulate in a plug-flow unit until they are drawn off by residual flow. The accumulated pollutants do not affect the amount of available storage and are assumed to be conservative (i.e., no decay). When residual flow occurs the entire unit contents (including the removed pollutant quantities) are mixed and drawn off until the unit is empty or wet weather continues. If wet weather (i.e., inflow) occurs before the unit is empty, the contents are placed into one plug for further routing.
>
> <u>Instantaneous Throughflow</u>
>
> Pollutants are routed instantaneously through units modeled as having no detention capability. In other words, the pollutants arriving during a time step leave the same time step less the removed portion. The amount of removed pollutants is determined by user-supplied removal equations (see later discussion). The removed pollutants are routed with the residuals stream.

> **<u>Pollutant Characterization</u>**
>
> **Pollutants are characterized by their magnitude (i.e., mass flow and concentration) and, if the user desires, by particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distributions. Describing pollutants by their particle size distribution is especially appropriate where small or large particles dominate or where several storage/treatment units are operated in series. For example, if the influent is primarily sand and grit, then a sedimentation unit would be very effective; if clay and silt predominate, sedimentation may be of little use. Also, if several units are operated in series, the first units will remove a certain range of particle sizes thus affecting the performance of downstream units. Therefore, the need for describing pollu­tants in more detail is obvious for modeling purposes. The pollutant removal mechanism peculiar to each characterization is discussed below.**

> <u>Characterized by Particle Size Specific Gravity or Settling Velocity Distribution</u> --
>
> <u>Particle Sizes and Specific Gravities</u> -- If a pollutant is characterized by its particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution, then it is removed from the waste stream by particle settling or obstruction. Many storage/treatment processes use these physical methods to treat waste­water; sedimentation and screening are among the most obvious examples.
>
> In this mode, the pollutant is apportioned over several (up to 10) par­ticle size/specific gravity ranges (e.g., ten percent of the BOD is found in the range from 10 to 50 microns) or settling velocities. Each of the ranges is preset by the user and assigaed an upper and lower bound on the particle diameter and a value for specific gravity. If a size/specific gravity distribution is specified the model estimates the average settling velocity for each range. Alternatively, the user may specify a set of set­tling velocity ranges. The user also specifies the apportionment of the pollutant over the various ranges as it enters the first unit. This distri­bution is modified as it passes through the storage/treatment plant. Un­fortunately, the distribution entered at the first unit must remain constant over time since the other blocks of SWMM do not provide a time-varying par­ticle size or settling velocity distribution.
>
> Each unit removes all or some portion of the particles in each range or velocity; the associated removal of the pollutant is easily determined. For example, if a sedimentation unit removes 50 percent of the particles in the 50 to 100 micron range and ten percent of the pollutant in question is found in this range, then five percent of the total pollutant load is re­moved. The total removal is determined by summing the effects of the sev­eral ranges or settling velocities passing through this unit. Once certain particles are removed, the distribution of particle sizes or settling ve­locities for the outflow can be determined and passed on to the next unit or receiving water. The removed particles constitute the size or settling velocity distribution for the sludge volume. The next several paragraphs describe the two mechanisms available to the user for pollutant removal when a pollutant is characterized by particle size or settling velocity.
>
> <u>Particle Settling</u> -- There are several forms of settling: unhindered set­tling by discrete particles, settling by flocculating particles, and hind­ered settling by closely spaced particles (Fair et al., 1968). For sim­plicity, the unhindered settling of discrete particles will be the removal mechanism simulated in this model. This procedure is <u>only</u> applicable to detention basins modeled as plug-flow reactors.

Ideally, these curves could be included in the model in some manner, but their representation is not straight forward from a programming standpoint. Instead, a simplification is used, based on early work of Hazen (1904) and the Bureau of Reclamation as described by Chen (1975).

If a value computed from equation IV-31 is less than 0.01 it is set equal to 0.01 and similarly for the quiescent boundary.

To summarize, the particle settling computations proceed as follows.

1.  For each size and specific gravity range a settling velocity is com­puted using equations IV-19 to IV-24 or a distribution of settling velocities is provided by the user. If a settling velocity distri­bution is used the end points of each range are averaged to estimate the representative velocity. Then for each velocity (in each plug leaving the unit) all steps below are performed.

2.  The turbulence factor, a, is computed from equation IV-31.

3.  E<sub>Q</sub> is computed using equation IV-25.

4.  E<sub>T</sub> is computed using equation IV-32 or IV-33.

5.  Finally, the removal efficiency for the particular particle

>
> In a normal simulation, several plugs leave the detention unit in any given time step. The effluent is all, or part of a number of plugs depending on the required outflow as determined by the storage routing techniques dis­cussed earlier. Thus, the effluent particle size or settling velocity dis­tribution is a composite of several plugs. This composite distribution is
>
> 436 IV-20
>
> **determined by taking a weighted average (by pollutant weight in each plug) over the effluent plugs. This distribution is then routed downstream for release or further treatment. The particles that were removed from each plug are also composited and are used to characterize the sludge volume.**
>
> **<u>Particle Obstruction</u> -- The second removal mechanism used when a pollutant** is **characterized by a particle size or settling velocity distribution is obstruction. The most obvious example of a storage/treatment process using this mechanism is screening. This mechanism is assumed by the model whenever a non-detention unit is encountered (and a pollutant is characterized by a size or settling velocity distribution). The user simply specifies a "criti­cal" size or settling velocity and any particles with a greater size or settling velocity are removed (and, in turn, so are the associated pollu­tants). The program operation is simple but the interpretation of the "critical" size or settling velocity is more complex.**
>
> **The primary** intent of including this mechanism in the model is to simu­late screens. Pollutant removal by screens is a result of two actions: the straining of the screens, and the additional filtration provided by the mat produced by the initial screening (Maher, 1974). Screens vary widely in thQ size of the aperture and the manner in which the waste water flows through them. To simplify the analysis, the removal of particles may be assumed to be a function of screen size only; i.e., the filtration by the mat is ignored. In other words, a particular screen size will remove only those particles larger than that size. If a settling velocity distribution is employed, the user must specify a settling velocity. This is not entirely accurate, of course, but the result is a conservative removal estimate that may be accurate in cases where backwashing is at a relatively high rate. In fact, a study by Maher indicates that this simplifying assumption is reason­able (Maher, 1974). In this case, a microstrainer with a Mark "0" screen (aperture of 23 microns) was installed in a residential area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The analysis of the backwash material for two storms (one in which a coagulant was used) revealed that, by particle <u>count,</u> 88 to 96 per­cent of the particles were indeed smaller than 23 microns. However, by <u>weight,</u> over 99 percent of the material was found in particles greater than 23 microns. Although Maher did not report the distribution in terms of weight, it was a simple matter to convert by assuming a specific gravity.
>
> During the simulation, a screen alters a particle size distribution for a particular time step without detention time. Again, only the particles larger than a specified or "critical" size are removed. The specified size may or may not correspond to the screen aperture, but such an assumption is probably valid given the preceeding discussion. If the specified size falls between the high and low ends of any range, the pollutants are removed by simple linear interpolation. For example, if 20 percent of the suspended solids are found in the range from 10 to 50 microns and the "critical" size is 20 microns, then 75 percent of the suspended solids in that range will be removed or 15 percent of the total suspended solids load. Of course, if the entire range is larger than the specified size, then all pollutants in that range are removed. If a pollutant is characterized by a settling velocity distribution (in lieu of a size distribution) the user specifies a "critical" settling velocity. The portion associated with velocities greater than or equal to the "critical" value is removed.
>
> 437 IV-21
>
> <u>Comment on Characterization by Particle Size Distribution</u> -- Pollutants characterized by a particle size or settling velocity distribution are restricted by the model to the two removal mechanisms discussed above. This limits the user somewhat if this characterization is chosen. The types of units that could be considered in this case would include sedimentation tanks and storage basins (operating as plug-flow reactors), bar racks, fine screens and microscreens. However, these units probably represent a large portion of the processes applied to the problem of combined sewer overflow and stormwater runoff. Thus, the limits of the applicability of the model using this mode are probably not too severe.

For example, in a single event simulation the calculated capital cost could only be considered an estimator of the true capital cost when the e'vent simulated is a design event. Likewise, when operating time is'a fac­tor in computing operation and maintenance costs, the calculated costs can be a valid estimator of the true costs only when a long term simulation is performed. Recent EPA publications provide useful information for the proper selection of the coefficients required in equations IV-35 through IV-42 (EPA, 1976, Benjes, 1976).

> SUMMARY
>
> A new Storage/Treatment Block has been developed that is somewhat dif-ferent from its predecessor. The model requires greater user input and knowledge of the processes being modeled. Storage/Treatment units may be modeled as detention or non-detention units. Pollutants may be character­ized by their magnitude alone or by magnitude and their particle size/ specific gravity distribution. Any three of the pollutants available from other blocks may be routed through the S/T Block. A simple cost routine is also included.

APPENDIX V

OTHER RUNOFF BLOCK REVISIONS

> INFILTRATION  
> <u>Introduction</u>
>
> For pervious areas SWMM users now have the option of specifying one of two alternative infiltration models: The Horton model or the modified Green-Ampt model (Horton, 1940, Green and Ampt, 1911). Horton's model is empirical and is perhaps the best known of the infiltration equations. Many hydrologists have a "feel" for the best values of its three parameters dc-spite the fact that little published information is available. In its usual form it is applicable only to events for which the rainfall intensity always exceeds the infiltration capacity, although the modified form used in SWMM is intended to overcome this deficiency.
>
> On the other hand the Green-Ampt equation is a physically based model which can give a good description of the infiltration process. The Mein-Larson (1973) formulation of it is applicable also for the case of rainfall intensity being less than the infiltration capacity at the beginning of the storm. Work is currently underway to help users evaluate the parameter val­ues from available soil data. With results from these studies now being published, use of the Green-Ampt model for estimating infiltration should increase.
>
> <u>Evaporation</u>
>
> Evaporation is input for each month as parameter VAP in subroutine RHYDRO and used in equations in subroutine WSHED as parameter EVAP. It is considered as a loss "off the top". That is, evaporation is subtracted from rainfall depths and/or ponded water prior to calculating infiltration. Thus, subsequent use of the symbol i for "rainfall intensity" is really rainfall intensity less evaporation rate. Although evaporation and infiltration are summed to form one total loss (RLOSS in subroutine WSHED) for the subcatch-ment runoff calculations, separate totals are maintained for the overall continuity check.

<u>Green-Ampt Equation</u>

<u>Infiltration During Rainfall Events</u>

The Green-Ampt equation (Green and Ampt, 1911) has received consider­able attention in recent years. The original equation, was for infiltration with excess water at the surface at all times. Mein and Larson (1973)

showed how it could be adapted to a steady rainfall input and proposed a way in which the capillary suction parameter could be determined. More recently Chu (1978) has shown the applicability of the equation to the unsteady rain­fall situation, using data for a field catchment.

The Mein-Larson formulation is a two-stage model. The first step pre­dicts the volume of water which will infiltrate before the surface becomes saturated. From this point onward, infiltration capacity is predicted by the Green-Ampt equation. Thus,

> **K<sub>s</sub> = saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil, ft/sec.**

**Equation V-22 shows that the volume of rainfall required to saturate the surface depends on the current value of the rainfall intensity. Hence, at each time step for which i \> K , the value of F is calculated and com­pared with the volume of rainfall<sup>s</sup>already infiltrated for this event. Only if F \> F<sub>s</sub> does the surface saturate, and further calculations for this con­dition use equation V-23.**

**When rainfall occurs at an intensity less than or equal to K, all rainfall infiltrates and is used only to update the initial moisture defi­cit, IMD. (The mechanism for this is discussed in the next subsection with reference to equation V-31.) The cumulative infiltration is not altered for this case of low rainfall intensity (relative to the saturated hydraulic conductivity, K<sub>s</sub>).**

**Equation V-23 shows that the infiltration capacity after surface satur­ation depends on the infiltrated volume, which in turn depends on the infil­tration rates in previous time steps.

In order to understand better the conversion of rainfall excess (rainfall and/or snowmelt less infiltration and/or evapor­ation) into runoff (overland flow), this subsection briefly describes the equations used for this purpose. It is intended to supplement the material presented in the original SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a).

> As discussed in Section 4, subcatchments are subdivided into three sub­areas that simulate impervious area, with and without depression (detention) storage, and pervious area (with depression storage). These are areas Al, A3 and A2 respectively on Figure V-4 and are denoted in subroutine WSHED by the subscript J, (J = 1, 2, 3, 4). When snowmelt is included, a fourth sub­area is added to account for the presence or absence of snow cover, (see Figure II-5 in Appendix II) but that case will not be considered further here. The depth of depression storage is an input parameter (WSTORE) for the im­pervious and pervious areas of each catchment. The impervious area without depression storage is specified for all subcatchments by parameter PCTZER (as a percent),

**Equation V-37 is then solved for d<sub>2</sub> using a Newton-Raphson iteration; the Fortran coding is located near the end of subroutine WSHED.**

**Given d<sub>2,</sub> the instantaneous outflow at the end of a time step, WFLOW, is computed using equation V-34. Parameter WFLOW is used in runoff quality calculations and is the flow value that is input to inlets and gutter/pipes. The instantaneous outflow at a given time is also the flow value transfered to subsequent SWMM blocks.**

**Although the solution of equation V-37 is straightforward and simple (and in fact may be performed on programmable hand calculators), some pecu­liarities exist'in the way the parameters for individual subareas (Al, A2, A3 in Figure V-4) are specified. In particular, only two values of WCON are computed (equation V-36), one for the pervious and one for the total imper­vious subareas. Thus, WCON is the same for calculating depths on subareas Al and A3 and is computed from equation V-36 using the total impervious area, Al plus A3, in the denominator. However, the instantaneous flow is computed using the individual area of each subarea (e.g., Al or A3). The net effect for subareas Al and A3 is approximately to reduce the subcatchment width by the ratio Al/(Al + A3) or A3/(Al + A3) as implied in Figure V-4. Numerical tests of this scheme versus one that uses the individual areas (and propor­tional widths) in parameter WCON indicate only about a half percent differ­ence between the two methods. Hence, it should be satisfactory.**

**Prior to performing these calculations, a check is made to see if losses are greater than the rainfall depth plus ponded water. If so, the losses (evaporation plus infiltration) absorb all water and outflow is zero. Similarly, if losses alone would be sufficient to lower the depth below the depression storage, the new depth is computed on this basis only and the outflow is zero.**

**The computational scheme (equations V-37 and V-38) has proven quite stable. The only instance for which non-convergence problems arise (or an attempt to compute a negative depth) is when the subarea values are very small (e.g., a few square feet) coupled with a large time step (e.g., ten minutes). Should a non-convergence message be printed, the problem may usually be cured by increasing the appropriate area or decreasing the time step.**

Two cross sectional shapes are avail­able for gutter/pipes: circular and trapezoidal, as shown in Figure V-6. Parameters representing depth (e.g., GDEPTH, Dl, DO) are actual depths, in feet, for trapezoidal gutters but not for circular pipes. Rather, for pipes the "depth" parameters are half of the angle subtended by the wetted peri­meter, in radians, as shown in Figure V-6.

APPENDIX VI

TRANSPORT BLOCK SCOUR AND DEPOSITION

INTRODUCTION

Deposition of solid material during dry-weather flow (DWF) in combined sewers and subsequent scour during wet-weather flow has long been assumed to form a significant contribution of solids to combined sewer overflows. The deposition-scour phenomenon is also evident in the "first flush" -- high solids concentrations at the beginning of a storm event -- found in many sewer systems. Even storm sewer systems may show a first flush if there is a base flow due to infiltration or illegal connections.

Deposition and scour processes were included in the original SWMM Transport Block as described in the documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). It simulated solids buildup during DWDAYS dry days prior to the storm and scour during the storm, as velocities increased. A constant horizontal approximation to the dimensionless shear stress on Shields' curve (described subsequently) was used to determine incipient motion, and one fixed particle size distribution (for suspended solids only) and specific gravity of 2.7 were used to characterize the solids.

Several problems existed in the routine, perhaps unknown to most SWMM users. The deposition-scour was dependent on the time step.

Buildup of solids would occur using a 1-hr time step for the dry days prior to simulation, but scour would occur using, say, a 10-min simu­lation time step with the same flow conditions. The particle size distribution was unaffected by the amount scoured from the bottom or deposited from the flow. Thus, there was no simulation of large particles being deposited in upstream conduits (and thereby unavailable for deposi­tion further downstream). It was not possible to calibrate the routine or even "turn it off" since all constants were incorporated into the program and were not input parameters. Finally, there were situations in which conservation of solids mass was violated. Although the revised routine still represents a gross approximation to the real sediment transport processes at work in sewer systems, it is at least consistent within itself, it conserves mass, and is both calibratable and avoidable.

There have been other recent investigations of solids deposition in sewers, most notably the work of Sonnen (1977) and Pisano et al. (1979). Sonnen's work is highly relevant to the modeling aspect since he developed

> 459 VI-1

a deposition-scour routine to accompany the Extran Block of SWMM. This model simulated both bed load and suspended load sediment transport and characterized the sediment by up to ten particle size-specific gravity ranges. Although his routines worked satisfactorily, they are not compatible with the "old" Transport Block, and the "new" Extran Block no longer routes quality parameters. In addition, they are perhaps overly sophisticated for the present needs. Thus, the current programming utilizes an approximate method that is not as sound as Sonnen's but does have the attributes described earlier.

The best characterization of solids in real sewer systems is given by Pisano et al. (1979) in their description of extensive field and analytical work done in the Boston area. The many problems inherent in dealing with real systems are amply demonstrated.

METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS  
<u>Overview</u>

> Since the criterion for deposition and scour depends upon the sediment

characteristics (notably size and specific gravity), one option for

simulation of the range of characteristics found in real sewer sediment

is to carry along a group of different sizes and specific gravities and

route each range individually. This is done in the Storage/Treatment

Block of SWMM and was done by Sonnen (1977). This has the disadvantage

of requiring large array sizes since each range must be simulated for

each conduit and preferably for each pollutant.

As an alternative, the present methodology utilizes a fixed particle size distribution and specific gravity (input by the user) for each desired pollutant and maintains a time history for each conduit of the <u>maximum</u> particle diameter (DS) in <u>suspension</u> (really, in <u>motion</u> -- via bed or suspended load) and the <u>minimum</u> particle diameter (DB) in the bed. Thus, the particle size distribution of particles in motion is the input distribution truncated on the right at DS, and the particle size distribution of deposited solids is the input distribution truncated on the left at DB. Mass-weighted values of DS are routed downstream for entry to subsequent conduits.

<u>Assumptions</u>

Several assumptions are inherent in the following development, including the following:

1\. Solids in sewer systems are<sub>.</sub>assumed to behave like ideal non-cohesive sediment described in various texts (e.g., Graf, 1971, Vanoni, 1975). Unfortunately, the work of Pisano et al. (1979) shows little evidence of this, and in fact, it may be an impossible task to provide an accurate theoretical description of transport of the highly hetero­geneous material constituting "solids" in real sewer systems. The only hope is that the theory will appear to behave in a "reasonable" manner.

> 460 VI-2

2.  No distinction is made between particle size distributions resulting from different pollutant sources, e.g., dry-weather flow and storms water. Only one distribution (and one average specific gravity) is used for each pollutant.

3.  Shields' criterion is used to determine the dividing particle size between motion and no motion.

4.  Once in motion, no distinction is made between bed and suspended load. Particles in motion ("suspension") are routed downstream in each conduit by complete mixing, the same as other quality parameters.

5.  When a critical diameter (CRITD) is determined for scour, all particles with diameter less than or equal to CRITD are eroded. There is no effect simulated of armoring or of erosion of layers of the bed.

6.  Scour-deposition is considered <u>only</u> in conduits. It is not simulated in non-conduits, including storage elements.

7.  The effect of deposited sediment on the bed geometry is not considered. When the hydraulic radius (an important parameter) is calculated to determine the critical diameter for motion, the bed is assumed to have the geometry of the conduit. This leads to some under­estimation of deposited material, mainly at low flows.

> SHIELDS' CRITERION
>
> Shields' diagram for the definition of incipient motion is shown in Figure VI-1. It is widely accepted as a good definition of the beginning of particle motion and describes the balance between the hydrodynamic forces of drag and lift on a particle (tending to induce motion) and the submerged weight of a particle (tending to resist motion). When hydro­dynamic forces acting on a sediment particle reach a value such that if increased even slightly will put the particle into motion, critical or threshold conditions are said to have been reached. Dimensional analysis of this condition leads to

> Experiments on critical shear stress (e.g., see Graf, 1971 and Vanoni, 1975) reveal the motion of sediment grains to be highly unsteady and non-uniformly distributed. Near critical conditions, observations of a large area of the sediment bed will show that the incidence of sediment motion occurs as gusts and is random in both time and space. Shields and others observed the process of initiation of motion to be stochastic in nature, so that there *is* no true "critical condition" at which motion suddenly begins. In fact, data on critical shear stress are based upon arbitrary definitions of critical conditions by several investigators. Shields himself determined T<sub>c</sub> as the value for zero sediment discharge obtained by extrapolation on a graph of observed sediment discharge versus shear stress.

Equation VI-9 works well for the coefficients a and b of equation VI-6. But for equation VI-4, b = -1 and the exponent approaches infinity. For the region R<sub>\*</sub> \< 1.47, all sediment particles are within the laminar sublayer of the flow, and motion is independent of the diameter (Graf, 1971). For practical purposes, there is no apparent motion, and the critical diameter is assumed to be the value at R<sub>\*</sub> = 1.47 in the model,

that is d <u>1.47-</u>

> The polynomial for the transition region, 1.47 \< R<sub>\*</sub> \< 10, is

rapidly solved using a Newton-Raphson iteration. In the program, equation VI-9 is first solved using the a and b values for equation VI-6 (10 \< R<sub>\*</sub> \< 400). If the resulting value of R<sub>\*</sub> is greater than 400, the critical diameter is evaluated from equation VI-7. If R<sub>\*</sub> is less 10, the polynomial approximation is then solved. If the resulting value of R<sub>\*</sub> from polyno­mial is greater than 10, the critical diameter is assumed to be the value at R<sub>\*</sub> = 10, and if R<sub>\*</sub> is less than 1.47, the value at R<sub>\*</sub>= 1.47 is used as a default.

Regarding the parameters of equation VI-9, the slope, S is taken as the invert slope (SLOPE) for each conduit, used by the Transport Block. The hydraulic radius is calculated at each time step, and the kinematic viscosity, v, (GNU) is input for each run. (It incorporates any tempera­ture effects.), The specific gravity (SPG) of sewer particles ranges from 1.1 for organic material to 2.7 for sand and grit. An average value, based upon the rough composition of the sediment, must be used. When quality parameters are input in card group Fl of the Transport Block, if SPG \< 1.0, the deposition-scour routine will not be used. It may be seen that if SPG is greater than 1.0 but very close to it, the value of CRITD in equation VI-9 becomes highly sensitive to it.

PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION

The particle size distribution for each pollutant for which it is desired to simulate deposition and scour is input by up to four straight line segments, as shown in Figure VI-3 (see also Figure 6-6). The distribution may be based upon characteristics of surface sediment for simulation of storm sewers, but should utilize sewer conduit samples for combined sewers.

An example will best illustrate the use of the particle size distri­bution. Consider first an example of scour. The distribution of Figure VI-3 is sketched again in Figure VI-4a. At the beginning of the time step, all particles in the bed are assumed to have diameters \> DB = 0.6 mm in the example. If a new critical diameter, CRITD, is calculated that is greater than DB, (CRITD = 1.5 mm in the example), the new bed distribution will become as shown in Figure VI-4b. The percent of the bed mass that is scoured is

INFLOWS AND JUNCTIONS

To allow some difference between surface inflows to the sewer system and dry-weather flow inflows (e.g., domestic sewage) a maximum particle size, PSDWF, may be specified (in card group Fl) for the pollutant found in DWF. This also applies to pollutants entering as a base flow in manholes. Pollutants entering via infiltration are assumed to be completely dissolved and have "zero particle sizes."

At junctions (manholes or other non-conduits), a new value of DS

is computed by mass weighting the merging values. For instance,

APPENDIX VII

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS OF URBAN RUNOFF  
QUALITY DATA FOR MODELING APPLICATIONS

Options for simulation of surface runoff quality in SWMM have been described in Section 4 of this report. They are basically two: use of a buildup-washoff equation or use of a rating curve. The former (equation 4-35) results in a characteristic loop effect when intra-storm loads are plotted versus runoff rate (Figure 4-36) while the latter must result in a single valued function. In this appendix, data from three separate sewered catchments in Seattle and one combined sewered catchment in Lancaster, PA are examined in order to see if SWMM has the ability to mimic their load and concentration versus flow characteristics. The data were taken from the EPA Urban Rainfall-Runoff-Quality Data Base (Huber et al., 1979) and analyzed using library statistical packages.

> Three parameters were chosen for analysis:

1)  Five day biochemical oxygen demand, BOD<sub>5,</sub>

2)  Total suspended solids, TSS, and

3)  N0<sub>2</sub>+N0<sub>3</sub>-N for Seattle and N0<sub>3</sub>-N for Lancaster.

The first parameter, BOD, is likely to be associated with solids, the second parameter is a solid, and the nitrogen parameters are likely to be dissolved. Hence, they may exhibit different characteristic relation­ships.

Results are presented in the following figures. (See also Figure 4-37.) Loops are evident in the Lancaster data (Figures VII-17 to VII-19) although eratic, since the runoff hydrographs are eratic. Loops are also present for the Seattle data although harder to detect since suces-sive points are not connected (Figures VII-4 to VII-6). As expected, nitrate concentrations decrease with increasing flow rate (Figures VII-16 and VII-20). Log-log plots tend to reduce the magnitude of the loops and could form the basis of a rating curve approximation. When loads for the three Seattle catchments are normalized by dividing by their respective catchment areas the data are grouped with less scatter (Figure VII-12) than when not normalized (Figure VII-11). The runoff rate in inches/hr is already a normalized flow rate for these catchments.

APPENDIX VIII

MISCELLANEOUS TRANSPORT BLOCK TABLES

The following tables provide guidelines for input into the infil­tration (subroutine INFIL) and dry-weather flow (subroutine FILTH)

routines of the Transport Block. Table gives average degree-days  
(cumulative deviation below 65<sup>°</sup>F, summed for the days of each month) for several U.S. cities. Current values are also tabulated in various summary forms by the National Weather Service.

Tables VIII-2 and VIII-3 provide guidelines for relative water use by various commercial establishments and industries. These may be entered as process flows in card groups P1 and Ql, for instance.

> **Quality routing in the Transport and Runoff Blocks through conduit segments has long been accomplished by assuming complete mixing within the conduit in the manner of a continuously stirred tank reactor or "CSTR." The procedure is described in the original SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, Appendix B) and was very similar to the complete mixing formulation of the Storage/Treatment Block. See, for example, the discussion of equations IV-9, IV-10 and IV-11 in Appendix IV. For the finite difference scheme of equation IV-11, however, it may easily be shown that negative concentrations may be predicted if**

> **At \> - (IX-1)**
>
> **where At = time step, sec,**
>
> **V = average volume in the conduit or storage unit, ft<sup>3</sup>, and  
> Q = average flow through the conduit or storage unit, cfs.**
>
> **This rarely causes a problem for storage unit simulation due to their large volumes. But when long time steps (e.g., 1 hr) are used in Runoff or Transport, instabilities in the predicted concentrations may arise.**
>
> **These may readily be avoided with minimal loss of accuracy by using the integrated form of the solution to the differential equation. The procedure is described by Medina et al. (1981) and is outlined below as applied to the Runoff and Transport Blocks.**
>
> **The governing differential equation for a completely mixed volume**

> **dVC dC dV**
>
> **dt = V<sub>c</sub>7<sub>E</sub>+ Q<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub> - <sup>QC - K</sup>CV <sup>+ L</sup> (IX-2)**

> **Q = outflow rate, cfs,**
>
> **K = first order decay coefficient, 1/sec, and**

> **503 IX-1**

> **An analytical solution of this equation is seldom possible when Q, Q<sub>i</sub>, C V and L vary arbitrarily with time, as in the usual routing through conduits. However, a simple solution is available to the ordinary, first order differential equation with <u>constant</u> coefficients if parameters Q, Q , C<sub>i</sub> , V, L and dV/dt are assumed to be <u>constant</u> over the solution time interval, t to t + At. In practice, average values over the time interval are used at each time step. Equation IX-2 is then readily integrated over the time interval t to t + At with**
>

**(IX-4)**

> **<u>V</u>**
>
> **where DENOM = Q/V + K + dV/dt (IX-5)  
> Thus, the concentration at the end of the time step is predicted as the sum of a weighted inflow concentration and a decaying concentration from the previous time step.**
>
> **Equation IX-4 is used in both the Runoff and Transport Block and is completely stable with respect to changes in At. It does not reflect rapid changes in volume and flow as well as the finite difference solution (e.g., equation IV-11) but it is updated at each time step. Given the many other uncertainties of quality routing within the sewer system, it should** *be* **adequate.**
