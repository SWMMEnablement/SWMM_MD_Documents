For instance, 5 percent of suspended solids could be added to BOD. Alternatively, different particle size ranges could be generated as different constituents, and other constituents could consist of fractions of the first group of different particle sizes. When these fractions are used, concentrations can be drastically (and subtly) increased if, for instance, suspended solids are high, soluble LOD is low and a fraction of 0.05 is used. The choice of whether or not any fractions should be entered depends upon how constituent data are being reported (e.g. total BOD or only the soluble fraction) and on how it is desired to simulate each con­stituent in SWMM.

SECTION 5

EXTENDED TRANSPORT BLOCK

> Following development of the original SWMM model, Water Resources Engineers (now, Camp, Dresser and McKee) participated in a study of the proposed master plan for control of combined sewer overflows in San Francisco. In order to analyze the complex hydraulics of that system, they developed the WRE Transport Model (Shubinski and Roesner, 1973), one that solves the coupled complete St. Venant equations and accounts for phenomena such as backwater, looped connections, surcharging and pressure flow that were either not considered or treated in a very simplified manner in the original Transport Model (Section 6). Through subsequent work for EPA in other cities the WRE Transport Model was acquired for the SWMM package and became known as the Extended Transport Model or Extran. This model has few peers in its capacity for simulation of the hydraulics of urban drainage system and is probably the most sophisticated such model that is non-proprietary and available in the public domain. (Similar proprietary models do exist.) Extran capabil­ities are compared with those of Runoff and Transport in Table 4-3.
>
> Extran has been part of the SWMM package since 1976. However, it has been rather poorly documented and the quality portion has never been used. In fact, the only (but very extensive) use for the model has been for hydraulic analysis, and the quality routing has been formally removed from the program. The state of the art in urban runoff quality modeling is such that adequate simulation of pollutographs may be performed using the simpler hydraulics of the Runoff and Transport Blocks.
>
> Comprehensive new documentation of Extran for this Version III of SWMM has been prepared by Camp, Dresser and McKee and is included as a separate addendum to this User's Manual (Roesner et al., 1981). Full details of the model are available therein. Interfacing between Extran and the remainder of SWMM is performed as described in Section 2.

SECTION 6

TRANSPORT BLOCK

BLOCK DESCRIPTION

<u>Introduction</u>

Flow routing through the sewer system may be accomplished in the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) by subroutine TRANS which is called from the Executive Block program. TRANS has the responsibility of coordinating not only routing of sewage quantities but also such functions as routing of quality parameters (subrouting QUAL), estimating dry-weather flow (DWF) (subrouting FILTH), estimating infiltration (subroutine INFIL), and calling internal storage (subroutine TSTRDT). The relationships among the subrou­tines which make up the Transport Block are shown in Figure 6-1. The pro­gram is about 5,000 cards long, consisting of 24 subroutines and functions.

This section describes the Transport Block, provides instructions on data preparation, and furnishes examples of program usage. Instructions are provided for these subroutines requiring card input data, namely: transport, internal storage, infiltration, and DWF. Examples, with sample I/O data, are given for transport, infiltration, and DWF computations.

<u>Broad Description of Flow Routing</u>

Differences in flow routing techniques among the Runoff, Transport and Extended Transort Blocks were described in Section 4 (e.g., Table 4-3); the techniques increase in complexity in the order just listed. A brief descrip­tion of techniques used in the Transport Block follows.

To categorize a sewer system conveniently prior to flow routing, each component of the system is classified as a certain type of "element." All elements in combination form a conceptual representation of the system in a manner similar to that of links and nodes. Elements may be conduits, man­holes, lift stations, overflow structures, or any other component of a real system. Conduits themselves may be of different element types depending upon their geometrical cross-section (e.g., circular, rectangular, horse­shoe). A sequencing is first performed (in subroutine SLOP) to order the numbered elements for computations. Flow routing then proceeds downstream through all elements during each increment in time until the storm hydro-graphs have been passed through the system.

The solution procedure is described in detail in the original SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a) and basically follows a kinematic wave approach in which disturbances are allowed to propagate only

> 220 6-1
>
> **in the downstream direction. As a consequence, backwater effects are not modeled beyond the realm of a single conduit, and downstream conditions (e.g., tide gates, diversion structures) will not affect upstream computa­tions. Systems that branch in the downstream direction can be modeled using "flow divider" elements to the extent that overflows, etc., are not affected by backwater conditions. Surcharging is modeled simply by storing excess flows (over and above the fullflow conduit capacity) at the upstream manhole until capacity exists to accept** the stored volume. Pressure-flow conditions **are not explicitly modeled and no attempt is made to determine if ground surface flooding exists. However, a message is printed at each time step for each location at which surcharging occurs. The Transport Block has proven its ability to model accurately flows in most sewer systems, within the limitations discussed above, and as such it should be adequate for most applications. However, it will not accurately simulate systems with exten­sive interconnections or loops, systems that exhibit flow. reversals or significant backwater effects, or systems in which surcharging must be treated as a pressure-flow phenomenon; the Extended Transport Block should** be used for this purpose (Section 5).
>
> An option in the program is the use of the internal storage **model which acts as a transport element. It is a scaled-down version of the Storage/ Treatment Block (Section 7) and provides the possibility of storagerouting of the storm at one or two separate** points within the sewer system (restricted by computer core capacity). The program routes the flow through the storage unit for each time step based on the continuity equation in a manner analogous to flood routing through a reservoir. Extensive backwater conditions may thus be modeled by treating portions of the sewer system as a storage unit with a horizontal water surface.
>
> <u>Broad Description of Quality Routing</u>
>
> Up to four contaminants are also handled by the Transport Block. Con­stituents may be introduced to the sewer system by any combination of four means:

2)  Storm-generated pollutographs may be entered on cards at designated inlet manholes.

3)  Residual bottom sediment in the pipes may be resuspended due to the flushing action of the storm flows (subroutine DWLOAD).

4)  For combined systems, dry-weather flow pollutographs (sub­routine FILTH) may be entered at designated inlet manholes.

<sup>d</sup>The Transport Block can receive inputs from the Runoff, Storage/Treatment,

> Extran, and Transport Block itself.
>
> 222 6-3

The routing of the pollutants is then done for each time step by subroutine QUAL. The maximum number of contaminants that can be routed is four. These may be selected arbitrarily from the input file, except that the FILTH rou­tine can only be used to generate suspended solids, BOD<sub>5</sub> and total coliforms. The scour/deposition routines may be used for any constituent.

<u>rrogram Operation</u>

Most of the input to TRANS is related to data needed to describe the particular sewer system being modeled (e.g., dimensions, slopes, roughnesses, etc.) and parameters needed to solve the governing flow routing equations.

Following input of these data, the sewer elements are sequenced for computations in subroutine SLOP. Certain geometric and flow parameters are then initialized in subroutine FIRST while others are initialized in TRANS. The various program parameters and initialized variables describing the elements are then printed. Parameters relating to the amount of data to be stored and printed out are also read (from cards).

If indicated, infiltration values will be calculated in subroutine INFTL and DWF quantity and quality parameters will be calculated in subroutine FILTH. Alternatively, user supplied values may simply be input at any manhole loca­tion. If desired, subroutine DWLOAD then initializes constituent depositions, and subroutine INITAL initializes flows and pollutant concentrations in each element to values corresponding to a condition of dry-weather flow and infiltration only.

The main iterations of the program consist of an outer loop on time steps and an inner loop on element numbers in order to calculate flows and concentrations in all elements at each time step. Inlet hydrographs and pollutograph ordinates are read from the interface file and/or cards to permit linear interpolation for values at each time step prior to entering the loop of element numbers.

When in the loop on element numbers (with index I), the current sewer element through which flows are to be routed, indicated by the variable M, is determined from the vector JR(I). This array is calculated in subroutine SLOP in a manner to insure that prior to flow routing in a given element, all flows upstream will have been calculated.

When calculating flows in each element, the upstream flows are summed and added to surface runoff, DWF, and infiltration entering at that element. These latter three quantities are allowed to enter the system only at non-conduits (e.g., manholes, flow dividers). If the element is a conduit, a check for surcharging is made. If the inflow exceeds the conduit capacity, excess flow is stored at the element just upstream (usually a manhole) and the conduit is assumed to operate at full-flow capacity until the excess flow can be transmitted. A message indicating surcharging is printed.

A simple hydraulic design routine is available at this point. If desired (NDESN = 1), when a surcharge condition is encountered, the conduit will be increased in size in standard increments (for circular pipes) or in

> 223 6-4
>
> six-inch width increments for rectangular conduits until capacity exists to accept the flow. (Conduits that are neither circular nor rectangular will be converted to circular if they need to be resized.) A message is printed indicating the resizing, and a table of final conduit dimensions is printed at the end of the simulation. This design operation will effectively elimi­nate surcharging but will also minimize in-system storage within manholes, etc. The net effect is to increase hydrograph peaks at the downstream end of the system. An obvious conflict can thus exist between controls aimed at curing in-system hydraulic problems and controls intended for pollution abatement procedures at the outfall.
>
> Flows are routed through each element in subroutine ROUTE and quality parameters are routed in subroutine QUAL. When routing flows in conduits, ROUTE may be entered more than once depending upon the value of ITER, the number of iterations. It is necessary to iterate upon the solution in certain cases because of the implicit nature of calculating the energy grade line in ROUTE.
>
> Upon completion of flow and quality routing at all time steps for all elements, TRANS then performs the task of outputting the various data. Hydrograph and pollutograph ordinates for any specified outfall point(s) may be written onto an interface file for further use by the Executive Block, and subroutine PRINTQ (or PRINTF for flows only) is then called for printing outflows for any of up to 80 desired elements.
>
> <u>Off-Line Files</u>
>
> The Transport Block uses two scratch data sts, NSCRAT(1) and NSCRAT(2), for storage of input and output hydrographs and pollutographs prior to print­ing. These are specified in the Executive Block using job control language (JCL) appropriate to the computer system. No input data will be sought from the interface file (Section 2) if JIN = 0, and no output will be placed on the file if JOUT = 0.

> INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATA PREPARATION  
> <u>Introduction</u>
>
> Instructions for data preparation for the Transport Block have been di­vided along the lines of the major components for clarity of the presenta­tion. These components are: (1) Transport, (2) Quality, (3) Internal Storage, (4) Infiltration and (5) Dry-Weather Flow. All data input card and tape/disk sources enter the Transport Block through one of these components. The typical data deck setup for the complete Transport Block is shown in Figure 6-2. Transport data describe the physical characteristics of the conveyance system. Quality data identify pollutants to be routed and their characteristics. Internal Storage data describe a particular type of Trans­port element. Infiltration and DWF data describe the necessary drainage area characteristics to permit the computation of the respective inflow quantities and qualities. Data card preparation and sequencing instructions for the complete Transport Block are given at the end of these instructions in Table 6-6.

1)  Preparation of theoretical data for use by subroutines en-gaged in hydraulic calculations in the program.

2)  Preparation of physical data describing the combined sewer system.

3)  Generation of inlet hydrographs and pollutographs required as input to the Transport Block and computational controls.

> Data for Step 1 are supplied with the SWMM program for 13 different conduit shapes, and it will only be necessary for the user to generate supplemental data in special instances. These instances will occur only when conduit sections of very unusual geometry are incorporated into the 5nwer system. Generation of such data will be discussed below.
>
> The primary data requirements for the user are for Step 2, the physical description of the combined sewer system, i.e., the tabulation of shape, dimension, slope, and roughness parameters, which will be discussed in detail below.

> The first data read by TRANS describe the number and types of different conduit shapes found in the system. Only in the case of a very unusual shape should it become necessary to generate theoretical data to supplement the data supplied by the program. The required data describe flow-area relation­ships of conduits, as shown in Figure 6-3 through the parameters ANORM and QNORM described below. A similar depth-area relationship is also required using the parameter DNORM.

> **For a given conduit shape (e.g., circular, rectangular, horseshoe), the hy­draulic radius is a unique function of the area of flow; hence, Q/Q<sub>f</sub> (inter­polated between values of QNORM) is a function only of A/A<sub>f</sub> (interpolated between values of ANORM). This function is tabulated for circular conduits in Appendix A of Chow (1959), for example, and on page 443 of Davis (1952) for a Boston horseshoe section. It is shown in graphical form for several conduit shapes in Chapter XI of Metcalf and Eddy (1914) from which some data supplied with this program have been generated. A list of the conduit shapes supplied with the Transport Block as well as all other element types is given in Table 6-1. The conduits are illustrated in Figure 6-4. If y = depth of flow, values of y/y<sub>f</sub> corresponding to A/A<sub>f</sub> (ANORM) are tabulated as the variable DNORM.**

> **It will often be satisfactory to represent a shape not included in Table 6-1 by one of similar geometry. This'use of "equivalent" sewer sections will avoid the problem of generating flow-area and depth-area data. An equivalent section is defined as a conduit shape from Table 6-1 whose dimensions are**

> such that its cross-sectional area and the area of the actual conduit are equal. Only very small errors should result from the flow routing when this is done.
>
> If it is desired to hve the exact flow-area and depth-area relation­ships, then the product AR<sup>213</sup> must be found as a function of area. In gen­eral, the mathematical description of the shape will be complex and the task is most easily carried out graphically. Areas may be planimetered, and the wetted perimeter measured to determine R. In addition, the depth may be measured with a scale. The required flow-area relationship of Equation 6-1 may then be tabulated as can the depth-area relationship. The number of points on the flow-area and depth-area curves required to describe the curves is an input variable (MM and NN, respectively). Note that the nor­malized flows (QNORM) and depths (DN0RM) must be tabulated at points corres­ponding to MM-1 and NN-1, respectively, <u>equal</u> divisions of the normalized area axis (ANORM). If desired, the routing parameters stored in the program may be listed by specifying KPRINT = 1 on card Al. The four pages of output are seldom necessary during the simulations, however.
>
> <u>Step 2. The Physical Representation of the Sewer System</u> --
>
> <u>General</u> -- These data are the diffe:-ent element types of the sewer system and their physical descriptions. The system must first be as a network of conduit lengths, joined at manholes (or other nonconduits). In addition, either real or hypothetical manholes should delineate significant changes in conduit geometry, dimensions, slope, or roughness. Finally, inflows to the system (i.e., stormwater, wastewater, and infiltration) are allowed to enter only at manholes (or other non-conduits). Thus, manholes must be located at points corresponding to inlet points for hydrographs generated by an external block and input points specified in subroutines FILTH and INFIL. In general, the task of identifying elements of the sewer system will be done most con­veniently in conjunction with the preparation of data for these other sub­routines, especially the Runoff Block.

> Each element (conduit or non-conduit) must be identified with a number which may range from 1 to 1000. They need not be sequential or continuous. Experience has shown that a schematic map showing the complete sewer network and the numbering system will be very useful for debugging and identification purposes. It is difficult to rely upon detailed (and often cluttered) sewer plans alone.
>
> <u>Description of Conduits</u> -- The 13 conduit. shapes supplied with the Wrili are shown in Figure 6-4. For each shape, the required dimensions are illustrated in the figure and specified in Table 6-2. In addition, Table 6-2 gives the formula for calculating the total cross-sectional area of the conduit.
>
> Usually, the shape and dimensions of the conduit will be indicated on plans. It is then a simple matter to refer to Figure 6-4 for the proper con­duit type and dimensions. If the shape does not correspond to any supplied by the program, it will ordinarily suffice to choose a shape corresponding most nearly to the one in question. For example, an inverted egg can be reasonably approximated by a catenary section. The dimensions of the substi­tute shape should be chosen so that the area of the substitute conduit and that of the actual conduit are the same. This is facilitated by Table 6-2, in which the area is given as a function of conduit dimensions. If desired, the flow-depth area parameters for up to two additional conduit shapes may be read in at the beginning of the program as discussed previously. (See also Card Groups B1-B9, Table 6-6.)
>
> Occasionally, the conduit dimensions and area may be given, but the shape not specified. It will sometimes be possible to deduce the shape from the given information. For example, a conduit may have an area of 4.58 ft<sup>2</sup>. (0.425 m<sup>2</sup>) and dimensions of 2 ft by 3 ft (0.6 by 1.0 m). First, assume that the 2 foot dimension is the width and the 3 foot dimension is the depth of the conduit. Second, note from Figure 6-4 that the ratio of depth to width for an egg-shaped conduit is 1.5:1. Finally, the area of an egg-shaped con-
>
> duit of 3 foot depth is 0.5105 x 9 4.59 ft<sup>2</sup> (0.426 m<sup>2</sup>). It is concluded  
> that the conduit should be type 3 with GEOM1 = 3 ft.
>
> Because of the limits on the size of the computer program, it will usually not be possible to model every conduit in the drainage basin. Conse­quently, aggregation of individual conduits into longer ones will usually be the rule. Average slopes and sizes may be used provided that the flow capac­ity of the aggregate conduit is not significantly less than that of any por­tion of the real system. This is to avoid simulated surcharge conditions that would not occur in reality. In general, flow calculations are rela­tively insensitive to conduit lengths although with conduits over 4000 to 5000 ft (1200 m and 1500 m) long some loss of routing accuracy will result. This is caused primarily when a large inflow enters a dry or nearly dry pipe, often at the beginning of the simulation. A non-convergence error message will be printed, but the resultant error is seldom significant. Conduit lengths should always be separated by manholes (or other non-conduit type elements). The conduit length should be measured from the center of the adjacent manholes. A further means of simulating large systems lies ia simulating different portions with separate Transport runs and combining the results using the Combine Block (see Section 3).

**Values of Manning's roughness may be known by engineers familiar with the sewer system. Otherwise, they may be estimated from tables in many engineering references (e.g., Chow, 1959, ASCE-WPCF, 1969) as a function of the construction material and sewer conditions. The value may be adjusted to account for losses not considered in the routing procedure (e.g., head losses in manholes or other structures, roots, obstructions). However, the flow routing is relatively insensitive to small changes in Manning's n.**

**<u>Description of Non-Conduits</u> -- The sewer system consists of many different structures, each with its own hydraulic properties. Elements 16 through 22 are designed to simulate such structures. Data requirements for these ele­ments are given in Table 6-3. Brief descriptions of these elements follow.**

**<u>Manholes (NTYPE = 16)</u> -- No physical data are required for manholes except their numbers and upstream element numbers. Note that the number of upstream elements is limited to three. If more than three branches of the system should join at a point, two manholes could be placed in series, allowing a total of five branches to joint at that point, etc. Flow routing is accom­plished in manholes by specifying that the outflow equals the sum of the inflows.**

**As an alternative to the use of the more detailed infiltration (INFIL) and dry-weather flow (FILTH) routines described later, flow and quality con­stituents may be input at manholes to simulate baseflow conditions. This input is constant over time and is allowed only at manholes and at no other element types.**

**<u>Lift Stations (NTYPE = 17)</u> -- The data requirements for lift stations are given in Table 6-3. It is assumed that the force main will remain full when the pump is not operating, resulting in no time delay in the flow routing (i.e., no time is required to fill the force main when the pump starts). When the volume of sewage in the wet** well reaches its specified capacity, the pumps begin to operate at a constant rate. This continues until the wet well volume equals zero. (Two-stage pumping may be simulated using a storage element.)

<u>Flow Dividers (NTYPE = 18 **and 21)**</u> **-- The routing procedure through these elements is explained in the discussion below. Typical** uses are given below.

1)  Simple diversion structure - A type 18 flow divider may be used to model a diversion structure in which none of the **flow is diverted until it reaches** a specified value (GEOM1). When the inflow is above this value, the non-diverted flow (QO1) remains constant at its capacity, GEOM1, and the surplus flow (Q02) is diverted.

2)  Cunnette section - A type 21 flow divider may be used to model a downstream cunnette section. The cunnette section is considered as a separate circular conduit to be placed parallel to the primary conduit as shown in Figure **6-5.** In order to model the cunnette as a semi-circle, the sep­arate circular conduit is given a diameter (GEOM1) so that

> **its area will be twice that of the actual total cunnette flow area. (The distance, slope and roughness will be the same as for the primary conduit.) A type 21 flow divider is then the upstream element common to both conduits, as shown in Figure 6-5. (The program assigns a value of GEOM1 of the flow divider equal to half the full flow capacity of the circular pipe simulating the cunnette so that it has the hydraulic characteristics of a semi-circle.) Any flow higher than GEOM1 will be diverted to the primary con­duit. Note that the parameter GEOM3 of the flow divider will be the element number assigned to the cunnette sec­tion. Note further that the element downstream from the two parallel conduits must list them both as upstream ele­ments.**
>
> **3) Overbank flow - A type 18 flow divider can be used to simulate flow into a main channel (undiverted flow) and into a parallel overbank channel for simulation of flooded conditions. Parameter GEOM1 would be set equal to the main channel capacity.** The channels could he of any **shape although two trapezoidal channels might be most appropriate for many natural configurations.**

**<u>Routing at Flow Dividers (NTYPE = 18 and 21)</u> -- Both types will divide the in­flow, QI, into two outflows, QO1 and Q02. The divider then acts as follows:**

> For 0 5 QI ≤ GEOM1, Q01 = QI
>
> Q02 = 0.0
>
> **(6-2)**
>
> **For GEOM1 QI, QO1 = GEOM1**
>
> **Q02 = QI - GEOM1**

**The undiverted outflow, QO1, will flow into the downstream element denoted by GEOM3. (The element into which Q02 flows does not need to be specified).**

**<u>Flow Divider (NTYPE = 20)</u> -- This element is used to model a weir-type diver­sion strucutre in which a linear relationship can adequately relate the flow rate and the depth of flow into the weir structure. Input parameters are de­fined in Table 6-3. The weir constant, incorporated into the variable ,ROUGH, can be varied to account for the type of weir. Typical values of the weir con­stant are 3.3 for a broad crested weir and 4.1 for a side weir.**

**The flow divider behaves as a function of the inflow, QI, as follows:**

> **For Q S QI S DIST, QO1 = QI**
>
> **Q02 = 0.0** (6-3)

> **For DIST ≤ QI, QO1 and Q02 are computed as follows:**

3)  Compute the undiverted flow:

> <u>Storage Unit (NTYPE 19)</u> -- This element is specified only when internal storage computations are required. Internal storage is modeled in a manner similar to the detention unit of the Storage/Treatment Block. (See Section 7 and Appendix IV.) Internal storage is modeled as a completely-mixed unit with a variety of outlet structures. However, as opposed to the detention unit in the S/T Block, pollutant removal is not simulated other than by decay. The storage unit must be described on card groups G1 to GS.
>
> A storage unit may be placed anywhere in the sewer system where appreci­able storage may exist, such as at an outflow or diversion structure. The required data inputs are described later. It should be noted that the stor­age area or "reservoir" may consist of a portion of the sewer system itself, and area-depth relationships must be worked out accordingly.
>
> <u>Backwater Element (NTYPE = 22)</u> -- This element may be used to model backwater conditions in a series of conduits due to a flow control structure downstream. The situation is modeled in a manner analogous to reservoir flood routing as follows:

1)  A storage element (NTYPE 19) is placed at the location of the control structure. The type of storage element will depend upon the structure (e.g., weir, orifice). One inflow to this storage element is then from the conduit just upstream.

2)  If the water surface is extended horizontally upstream

> from the flow control structure at the time of maximum
>
> depth at the structure, it will intersect the invert slope of the sewer at a point corresponding to the assumed maxi­mum length of backwater. The reach between this point and the structure may encompass several conduit lengths. A
>
> backwater element (NTYPE 22) is placed at this point of
>
> maximum backwater, in place of a manhole, **for instance.**

3)  The backwater element then diverts flow directly into the storage element depending upon the volume of water (and hence, the length of backwater) in the storage element. If the backwater extends all the way to the backwater ele­ment, the total flow is diverted to the storage element; none is diverted to the conduits.

4)  The amount of diverted flow (QO1) is assumed directly pro­portional to the length of the backwater. The storage area in reality consists of the conduits. Since most conduits

> 239 6-20
>
> can be assumed to have a constant width, on the average, the backwater length is assumed proportional to the square root of the current storage volume, obtained from the storage routine.

3)  The parameter GEOM3 of the backwater element must contain the element number of the downstream storage unit.

4)  Parameters for the storage element are read in as usual. Note that the depth-area values will correspond to the storage area of the upstream conduits. Note also that the storage unit must list the backwater element as one of its upstream elements, as well as the conduit immediately upstream.

5)  At each time step, the backwater element computes the ratio of current to maximum storage volume in the downstream storage element. Call this ratio r. Then

>
> and (6-4)  
> Q02 = OI - Q01

> <u>Step 3. Input Data and Computational Controls</u> --
>
> <u>Options</u> -- The basic input data, hydrographs and pollutographs are generated outside of the Transport Block. However, certain operational controls are available within Transport.
>
> <u>Choice of Time Step (DT)</u> -- The size of the time step must be an integer multiple or integer fraction of the time step used in the preceding block. In tests of sensitivity (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a), it was found that except for very small values of DT (10 seconds), the output from Transport is insensitive to the length of the time step. Between values of two minutes and 30 minutes, hydrograph ordinates varied by less than one per­cent. For extremely short time step values, the peak flow moved downstream faster and never attained the maximum value that it had with a DT of two minutes and longer. Within the range commonly needed by SWMM users (two minutes to 30 minutes), the choice of time step will not significantly affect results. However, continuity errors can occasionally arise if the time step is "appreciably" longer than the travel time through any conduit. "Appreciably" longer means about factor of two.
>
> <u>Choice of Number of Time Steps (NDT)</u> -- The number of time steps is not restricted. The program will use the number input in Transport (NDT) or the number used by the preceding block, whichever gives the shorter simulation time.
>
> 240 6-21
>
> **<u>Choice of Number of Iterations (NITER)</u> -- The purpose of iterations in the computations is to eliminate flow oscillations in the output. The flatter pipe slopes (less than 0.001 ft/ft) require iterations of the flow routing portion of the Transport Model to help dampen these oscillations. Four iterations have proven to be sufficient in most cases.**
>
> **<u>Choice of Allowable Convergence Error (EPSIL)</u> -- Convergence of the flow routing procedure should not be any problem, and -the default value of EPSIL, 0.0001, may be used. It will provide sufficient accuracy and result in only a very minimal increase in computer time over larger values. The only conver­gence problems that may exist can occur when flow enters a dry conduit. For instance, this could occur at the beginning of a storm in a sewer with little or no base flow. Messages to this effect will be printed if parameter NPRINT**
>
> **0. These may almost always be ignored since the default options in subrou­tine ROUTE will continue program execution and only result in a very small error in continuity (a fraction of a percent).**
>
> **<u>Alternate Hydrograph and Pollutograph Inputs</u> -- Hydrograph and pollutographs may be entered from a tape/disk file (e.g., as generated in the Runoff Block) and/or entered from cards, using card groups Il and R1 in Table 6-6. Param­eters NCNTRL and NINPUT are set accordingly. Note that input from both cards and tape/disk may be performed simultaneously. If, for some reason, input from cards is not desired, a tape/disk file containing the specified input values could be created and specified as an input file to Transport in place of, say, a file generated by the Runoff Block. The format of such a file is described in Section 2.**

Although these would often be chosen from the group (up to ten) supplied by the Runoff Block (or another preceding block), they do not have to he since card input may be used in addition to the interface file. If the same pollutant is entered from both the interface file and from cards, the description (name, name of units, type of units) from the inter­face file must he used. If the pollutant is entered only from cards, this description must be supplied on card group Fl. Further information on pollutant description is contained in Section 4.**

> <u>Routing</u> --
>
> Routing of quality parameters is performed by using the integral solu­tion for the output from a completely mixed conduit volume (Medina et al., 1981). See Appendix IX for a derivation. Although this tends to introduce artificial dispersion of concentration profiles, it is the most convenient way in which to introduce new loadings at manholes along the system, as well as to facilitate scour and deposition calculations. The quality routing procedure is not subject to calibration directly. However, the routing becomes closer to pure advection (plug flow) as the number of elements is increased.
>
> <u>Scour and Deposition</u> --
>
> The basis for these procedures is described in Appendix VI. Each pollutant is assigned a specific gravity (SPG) and particle size distri­bution, assumed to apply throughout the drainage system regardless of the source of the pollutant, e.g., stormwater or dry-weather flow. If the specific gravity is less than or equal to 1.0, the pollutant is considered to be entirely suspended (or dissolved) and not subject to scour and deposition. If all calibration is to be performed using Runoff Block buildup-washoff parameters, for instance, it may be desirable to avoid the complexity of simulating a second real but largely unknown source.
>
> Typical particle size distributions (and interpretation of input param­eters PSIZE and PGR) are illustrated in Figure 6-6. Such information should be collected first hand at each catchment; secondary sources such as Sartor and Boyd (1972), Shaheen (1975), Manning et al. (1977) and Pisano et al. (1979) should be used only if local data are not available. During the simu­lation scour and deposition are simulated using Shield's criterion to deter­mine the critical diameter for incipient motion and deposition (see Appendix VI). The kinematic velocity of water (GNU on Card D2) is a function of temperature and used to calculate the boundary Reynolds number on Shield's diagram (Graf, 1971, Vanoni, 1975). For each conduit, the critical diameter is determined as a function of velocity, roughness and specific gravity. At the same time, the maximum diameter of the <u>suspended</u> fraction and the <u>minimum</u> diameter of the <u>settled</u> fraction is maintained. If the critical diameter is less than the maximum of the suspended material, more is settled; the settled mass is determined by multiplying by a fraction determined from the particle size distribution (Appendix VI). Similarly, if the critical diameter is greater than the minimum of the settled material, more is suspended. The settled material is thus assumed to have the particle size distribution of the right hand tail of the total distribution (Figure 6-6), and the sus­pended material has the distribution of the left hand side.
>
> Decreasing the specific gravity (downwards toward 1.0) increases the amount suspended and vice versa. As SPG approaches 1.0 closely the proce­dure becomes very sensitive to SPG since there is a division by SPG-1.0. Typical values of specific gravities of particulate matter in sewers range from 1.1 for volatile material to 2.7 for sand and grit. The actual situa­tion in which each particle size range may have its own specific gravity can be handled by the Storage/Treatment Block, but not the Transport Block

> (except that up to four different pollutants may be simulated). Since it is only one parameter, calibration of the scour-deposition routine may be most easily calibrated using SPG. Alternatively, a greater percentage of large diameter material may be assigned a pollutant using the particle size distribution if, for instance, more deposition were desired.
>
> Unlike the previous Transport Model, continuity of pollutant mass is now maintained during scour and deposition. In addition, larger particles can settle upstream in flat conduits and be unavailable for downstream settling. An initial settled mass in each conduit is computed prior to the start of the simulation by running the routine for DWDAYS days (card D2) prior to the storm event (or longer) simulation. This initial deposition is assumed to start with a clean bed.
>
> Although this scour-deposition routine is a far cry from the detailed sewer sediment transport program developed by Sonnen (1977), it is reason­ably simple, consistent and may be calibrated. And should the user desire, it may be bypassed (using SPG.51.0), and all quality calibration performed in the Runoff Block.

In fact, however, the user has most of the responsibility for infiltration estimation, optionally using techniques described below. The program does little more than apportion it properly.
>
> For the purposes of analysis, infiltration is classified into four categories, i.e., miscellaneous sources causing a base dry weather inflow, frozen residual moisture, antecedent precipitation, and high groundwater. The cumulative effects of the first three sources can be seen in Figure 6-8 which excludes surface runoff. Figure 6-8 shows total infiltration QINF as the sum of dry weather infiltration DINFIL, wet weather infiltration RINFIL, and melting residual ice and frost infiltration SINFIL. However, in cases where the groundwater table rises about the sewer invert, it is assumed that groundwater inflow GINFIL alone will be the dominant source of infiltration. Thus, infiltration is defined as:

> DINFIL + RINFIL + SINFIL
>
> QINF = or (6-5)
>
> GINFIL for high groundwater table

**<u>Dry Weather Infiltration (DINFIL)</u>** --

**If the study area under consideration has been gaged, base dry-weather infiltration can be taken by inspection from the flow data. In the absence of flow data, an estimate of the unit infiltration rate XLOCAL (gpm/inch-diameter per mile) for dry weather must be obtained from local professionals. From data in the form of calculated values of DIAM and PLEN, Equation 6-6 can then be used to determine DINFIL (gpm):**

**Values of XLOCAL range from 250 to 600 gpm/in-diameter per day (ASCE-WPCF, 1969) and may be even higher for laterals with many stubs and wyes. The importance of local data cannot be over-emphasized.**

<u>Residual Meltin€; Ice and Frost Infiltration (SINFIL)</u>

SINFIL arises from residual precipitation such as snow as it melts fol­lowing cold periods. Published data (American Soc. of Heating and Air Condi­tioning Engineers) in the form of monthly degree days (sum of **deviations below 65°F) provide an excellent index as to the significance of SINFIL. Average monthly degree-days for cities in the United States are reproduced in Appendix VIII. The onset and duration of melting can be estimated by noting the degree days NDD above and immediately below a value of 750. Refer to Figure 6-9 for the following description.**

**Within subroutine INFIL, the beginning of melting, MLTBE, is taken as the day on which NDD drops below 750. Next, MLTEN is determined so that *A<sub>l</sub>* equals A<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that the melting rate is sinusoidal. The maximum contribution RSMAX from residual moisture can be determined from previous gaging of the study area or local estimates. In either case, SINFIL is determined within the program by the following equation:**

**RSMAX•sin\[180•(NDYUD-MLTBE)/(MLTEN-MLTBE)\]**

> RINFIL depends upon antecedent precipitation occurring within nine days prior to an estimate. If antecedent rainfall is unavailable or less than about 0.25 in (6.4 mm), the RINFIL contribution to QINFIL is usually small. For larger antecedent rainfall contributions, regression techniques offer one method of estimating RINFIL. For example, during development of the infiltration routine, available rainfall and infiltration data were examined (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). For three areas in which sewer flow data were not affected by melting, RINFIL was found to satisfy the following linear relationship:

**<u>Apportionment of Infiltration</u> --**

**Once an estimate of the total local infiltration QINF has been obtained, this flow must be apportioned throughout the designated study area. The cri­terion chosen for apportionment is an opportunity factor OPINF which repre­sents the relative number and length of openings susceptible to infiltration. Pipe joints constitute the primary avenue for entry of infiltration (Geyer and Lentz, 1963). The number and length of joints is assumed to be propor­tional to the relative surface area of each conduit. For each, an equivalent circular pipe diameter will be proportional to the square root of its known cross sectional area, ft. Then the fraction of total infiltration ("oppor­tunity"** for infiltration) allocated to each conduit, OPINF, is:

**and the summation in the denominator is over all conduits. Trapezoidal chan­nels are treated the same as all others. The apportioned infiltration enters the system at the non-conduit element immediately upstream of the conduit.**

**This procedure allocates the most infiltration to the largest and long­est conduits. Should local information dictate otherwise, infiltration may be apportioned by the user and entered at appropriate manholes in card group El.**

> Ideally, the rainfall record would be from a rain gage which is located near the center of the study area and which records daily rainfall in inches. If more than one rain gage is located within the study area, daily measure­ments from all gages should be averaged. Missing data (e.g., from a malfunc­tioning gage) or a total absence of measurements due to no gaging within the study area can sometimes be overcome with measurements taken from a rain gage located within a few miles. If National Weather Service (NWS) Climatological Data recorded at the nearest airport or federal installation are not avail­able, contact the National Weather Records Center (Asheville, NC) for assistance.

> Should some other form of precipitation, e.g., snowfall, be encountered, it will *be* necessary to convert this to equivalent rainfall. If estimates are unavailable from the NWS, the ratio of ten inches of snow to one inch of rain may be used.

However, shallow-well data from the US Geological, Survey or state geological office can be used to supplement missing data. Water table ele­vations are not required if they are below the sewer inverts for the day on which QINF is to be estimated.

> <u>Sewer Data</u> -- Sewer flow data for regression analysis should be taken from a gage located at the downstream point within the study area. Upstream gag­ing may sometimes be used to estimate flows at the downstream point by simply adjusting flows based upon respective surface area. Physical sewer data (e.g., lengths, diameters) are taken from prior input used within TRANS to route sewer flow.

>
> DINFIL = dry weather infiltration,
>
> RINFIL = wet weather infiltration,
>
> SINFIL = melting residual ice and snow, and
>
> GINFIL = groundwater infiltration.

<u>Step 1. Determine Groundwater Condition</u> - If the groundwater table is pre­dominantly above the sewer invert, all infiltration is attributed to this source (GINFIL). In this case, an estimate of Lhe LuLal infiltration is made directly (i.n cfs for the total drainage basin) and read in card Kl. This card followed by a blank card (card K2) would complete the infiltration data input. If the groundwater table is not predominantly above the sewer invert, proceed to Step 2.

<u>Step 2. Build-Up Infiltration from Base Estimates</u> -- From measurements, historical data, or judgment, provide estimates of DINFIL and RINFIL. In this case, GINF1L must be set equal to 0.0. Finally, if needed, provide the peak residual moisture (RSMAX), and the 12 monthly degree-day totals taken from Appendix VII or a local source.

<u>Pry Weather Flow Model  
Methodology</u> --

Subroutine FILTH has been developed as an option to estimate average sewage flow and quality from residential, commercial, and industrial urban areas. FILTH estimates sewage inputs at discrete locations along the trunk sewers of any specified urban drainage basin. These estimates are calculated from data describing drainage basin subsections (subcatchments and subareas) under which the trunk sewer passes. In this routine, dry-weather flow quan­tity and quality are developed from regression equations, as explained in the documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). The estimates are for three <u>specific</u> quality parameters: BOD<sub>5</sub>, suspended solids (SS) and total coliforms. Thus, if any different parameters are to be simulated, FILTH cannot be used. However, if a fourth parameter is to be routed in addition to BOD<sub>5,</sub> SS and total coliforms, FILTH can be used to provide estimates for the first three but not the additional one. Also bear in mind that a con­stant base flow for any parameter may be input at manholes in card group El.

When FILTH is not used, DWF estimates may be input at desired manholes, as discussed previously. In fact, this; option may *be* routinely used in place of FILTH whenever reasonable estimates are available for instream DWF quan­tity and quality.

An example of a hypothetical sewer system and input situation for FILTH is given in Figure 6-10. To avoid confusion with Runoff Block subcatchments, all drainage basin subdivisions will be referred to as subareas in the fol­lowing discussion. As shown in the figure, an input manhole near the center of each subarea is assumed to accept all sewage flow from that subarea. Criteria for establishing subarea boundaries and input locations are dis­cussed later in the text.

> **In the context of the SWMM, FILTH calculates daily sewage flow (cfs) and characteristics (BOD<sub>c</sub>, SS, and total coliforms) averaged over the entire year for each subarea. FILTH is called from subroutine TRANS by setting the parameter NFILTH equal to one. Flow and quality characteristics estimates and corresponding manhole input numbers are then returned to TRANS where the estimates undergo adjustment depending upon the day of the week and hour of the day during which simulation is proceeding.**
>
> **The subroutine may** *be* **omitted when modeling separate storm sewers unless it is desired to generate a base flow with DWF characteristics. FILTH is designed to handle an unrestricted number of inlet areas and indi­vidual process flow contributors. As a safeguard against faulty data, how­ever, a program interrupt is provided if the combined number exceeds 159, which is a limit set by the Transport Model.**
>
> **<u>Quantity Estimates</u> --**
>
> **Three data categories are used to estimate sewage flow: (1) drainage basin data, (2) subarea data, and (3) decision and adjustment parameters.**
>
> **Study area data are TOTA, KTNUM and ADWF. KTNUM denotes the number of subareas into which a drainage basin, having a surface area TOTA (acres), is being divided. ADWF, which is optional depending upon its availability, gives the average sewage flow (cfs) originating from the entire drainage basin (e.g., average flow data from a treatment plant serving the study area). When it is included, the predicted basin flow will be adjusted to match this value.**
>
> **Subarea data requirements consist of several options depending upon availability and choice of input. Discussion later in the text will assist in data tabulation by noting the order of preference where options exist. Subarea data can be broken into three categories** as **follows: (1) identifi­cation parameters, (2) flow data, and (3) estimating data.**
>
> 1\) **<u>Identification parameters</u> -- Identification parameters are KNUM, INPUT, and KLAND. KNUM identifies each subarea by a number less than or equal to KTNUM. For each of the KTNUM subareas, INPUT indicates the number of the manhole into which DWF is assumed to enter. Land use within each sub­area which approximately corresponds to zoning classifica­tion, is categorized according to Table 6-5. KLAND serves as an important factor in deciding subarea locations and sizes. Figure 6-10 will assist in describing how the above data are determined and tabulated.**

2)  <u>Flow</u> data.-•- Flow data are optional inputs that eliminate the need for using predictive equations. Two possible types of flow data are average sewage flow measurements, SEWAGE, and metered water use, WATER. Commercial or industrial sewage flow or water use measurements should be input using the variable SAQPF. Flows from commercial and in­dustrial establishments located in residential or open subareas may be included using SAQPF, also. Metering at lift stations and other flow control structures within the study area is occasionally available and should be used whenever possible. Metered water use offers a more available source of subarea flow data. Unfortunately, considerable effort in locating, tabulating, and aver­aging these data is often required.

3)  <u>Estimating data</u> -- For each subarea where SEWAGE or WATER measurements are not available estimated water use must be used as an estimate of sewage flow. In the case of a fac­tory or commercial establishment, estimates can be made by multiplying the number of employees by an established co­efficient (gpd per employee). In the case of a large fac­tory or commercial establishment, one subarea may be estab­lished with estimated water use tabulated as SAQPF for that subarea. On the other hand, estimates of water use for established non-residential areas (e.g., industrial parks or shopping centers) may be summed and tabulated as SAQPF for one large subarea. A list of the above mentioned co­efficients is given in Appendix VIII.

> In the case of residential areas, estimating data for each subarea are METHOD, PRICE, ASUB, POPDEN, DWLINGS, FAMILY, and VALUE. Default values and definitions of each of these are given in the description of input data. Decision and adjustment parameters consist of DVDWF, HVDWF, KDAY, CPI, and
>
> 256 6-37

CCCI\. DVDWF and HVDWF are daily and hourly correction factors, respectively, for DWF. DVDWF is comprised of seven numbers that are ratios of daily aver­age sewage flows to weekly average flow. Likewise, HVDWF is comprised of 24 numbers that are ratios of hourly average sewage flows to daily average flow. Both groups of 'numbers may be derived from observed flow variation patterns throughout the country (e.g., Tucker, 1967, Portland Cement Association, 1968). Their use is to correct measured or estimated average sewage flow Lu more accurate eatimates depending upon the day and hour. Typical sewage flow variations are shown in Figures 6-11 and 6-12. These flow patterns are only examples; locally observed patterns more accurately describe local variations and should be used when available.

KDAY denotes the day of the week at which simulation is to begin. As the simulation proceeds, this value is continually updated. By using the current day and hour, the appropriate values of DVDWF and HVDWF can be multiplied by average flow to determine the correct value. KDAY ranges from 1 to 7 with Sunday being day number 1.

Two cost indices are employed to adjust current house valuations and water prices to appropriate 1960 values and 1963 prices, respectively. This is done because estimating equations within FILTH are based upon 1960 values and 1963 prices. CPI, consumer price index, has been chosen to adjust water price by multiplying water price by 1960 CPI divided by the current CPI. CCCI, composite construction cost index, has been chosen to adjust house valuations similarly. Both indices can be found in most libraries in jour­nals on economic affairs (e.g., U.S. Dept. of Commerce, <u>Survey of Current Business and Statistical Abstracts of the United States).</u>

<u>Quality Estimates</u> --

The purpose of the DWF quality computation is to apportion waste charac­teristics (such as would be measured at a sewage treatment plant before treatment) among the various subareas in the drainage basin under study, or in the event no measured data are available, to estimate and apportion usable average values. The apportionment is based upon the flow distribution, land use, measured or estimated industrial flows, average family income, the use or absence of garbage grinders, and infiltration.

Daily and hourly correction factors for concentrations of BOD, SS and total coliforms are input in conjunction with those for flow variations. All are expressed as ratios of instantaneous to annual or daily averages.

Card Ni includes the total number of subareas and process flow sources to be processed along with the type case (whether the total DWF character­istics are known or to ***be*** estimated), the number of process flow contribu­tors, the cost indices, and the total drainage basin population. Depending upon the instructions given, computations proceed along the Case 1 or Case 2 channel.

Dry-weather flow quality starts with the average BOD<sub>5</sub> and SS concentra­tions (A1BOD and A1SS) previously computed for the entire subarea. These are used for the concentrations of non-process flows for all subareas, with two exceptions. First, for commercial and industrial areas, the average concentrations are multiplied by 0.9. Second, the strengths of residential flows are adjusted according to average family income, XINCOM, and percent garbage grinders, PCGG, as explained in the documentation.

The process flow load (i.e. flow times concentration) is then added to the loads just computed, for all land uses. For non-residential land use process flows could constitute the only quality loads.

Finally, for all subareas, total coliforms are computed solely on the basis of population using the average concentration, AlCOLI, computed earlier along with the total basin populations, POPULA, (card N1) and subarea popula­tions computed from POPDEN (card Q1). Thus, there will be a subarea contri­bution of total coliforms only if POPDEN \$ O.

For each of the KTNUM subareas, subtotals (cumulative up to this sub­area) of computed flows and quality will he printed for each subarea if MSUBT \$ 1. Otherwise, only basin totals will be printed. If measured basin averages have been input on card 01 (KASE = 1) all subarea loads are adjusted by a constant ratio such that the flow and concentrations computed from the data of card group Q1 will agree with the input averages.

<u>Summary of Dry Weather Flow Requirements</u> --

<u>Step 1. Establishing Subareas</u> -- Establishment of the subareas constitutes the initial step in applying subroutine FILTH. Both detail of input data and assumptions made in developing FILTH imply constraints on the type, size, and number of subareas. However, most important in subarea establishment is the type of estimating data available and the maintenance of homogenous land use.

Subareas should be located and sized to utilize existing sewer flow measurements taken within the drainage basin. These measurements should be recent and of sufficient duration to provide a current average sewage flow value for the period of time during which simulation is to proceed. Measured daily and hourly flow variation should be used in lieu of generalized values described earlier in the text. A gaging site with less than 200 ac (81 ha) contributing flow often provides a convenient data input situation. A sub­area should be established upstream from the gage with average sewage flow tabulated as SEWAGE for that subarea. It is convenient, though not neces­sary, for the subareas to correspond to subcatchments in Runoff.

If metered water use is to be used to estimate sewage flow, subareas should be located to coincide with meter reading zones or other zones used by the water department that simplify data takeoff. Since water use would be used to estimate sewage flow, average winter readings should be used to minimize the effects of lawn sprinkling and other summer uses.

> 261 6-42
>
> If neither gaging nor metered water use are input, sewage characteris­tics must be estimated. Subareas should then be established to yield apprO-priate input data for the residential estimating equations in FILTH. Zero sewage flow is assumed from commercial, industrial, and parkland subareas for which SEWAGE and WATER are zero and measurements of SAQPF are not given. Since KLAND and VALUE are the significant variables in estimating subarea sewage flow, subareas should be located and sized to include land with uni•-form land use and property valuation. To utilize es-sting census data, sub­area boundaries should *be made* to coincide with census tract boundaries.
>
> Criteria for establishing subareas are listed in the following summary:
>
> 1\) Subareas in general should:

1.  be of homogenous land use;

2.  be less than or equal to 159 in number; and

3.  conform to the branched pipe network.

> 2\) Subareas should be established to employ any existing sewer flow measurements.
>
> 3\) Subareas for which metered water use is used to estimate sewage flow should be compatible with meter reading zones.
>
> 4\) Residential subareas for which estimated water use is used to estimate sewage flow should:

1.  be uniform with respect to land use;

2.  be uniform with respect to dwelling unit  
    > valuation; and

3.  coincide with census tracts.

> <u>Step 2. Collection of Data</u> -- Other than the establishment of measured data described earlier, the primary data source is the US Bureau of Census for census tract information. This source provides readily available data on population distribution, family income, and the number and relative age of dwelling units. City records, aerial photographs, and on-site inspection may be necessary to define land use activities, process flow, and dwelling density variations within tracts.
>
> <u>Step 3. Data Tabulation</u> -- Once subareas have been established, several alternatives exist regarding data tabulation. An identification number KNUM should be given to each subarea prior to data takeoff. However, once KNUM's have been established, corresponding INPUT manhole numbers are selected from a previously numbered schematic diagram of the trunk sewer. This numbered schematic serves as the mechanism to coordinate runoff, infiltration, and sewage inputs. Refer to the Transport discussion for additional information about the numbered schematic. If water use estimates are necessary, land

> **use should be dt!termined from city zoning maps and the previously tabulated values for KLAND.**
>
> **ADWF should be tabulated as average drainage basin sewage flow. As the ADWF, SEWAGE should be averaged from flow data for the appropriate month, season, or year. ADWF, SAQPF, or SEWAGE may be obtained from routine or specific gaging programs done by the city, consulting engineers, or other** agencies. SAQPF may **be estimated for commercial and industrial areas** using **water use coefficients (Appendix VIII). Also, SAQPF and WATER may be deter­mined for all land use categories from water meter records.**
>
> **<u>Initialization</u>**
>
> **Following execution of subroutines INFIL and/or FILTH, flows and con­centrations will be initialized to base flow values simply by summing flows and loads at all junctions (non-conduits) in subroutine INITAL. Base flow can thus originate from three sources: input at manholes, infiltration (sub­routine INFIL), and/or dry-weather flow (subroutine FILTH). Inflows from FILTH are always subject to the hourly and daily adjustment factors; inflows from INFIL and manholes are not.**
>
> **In addition, the buildup of settled pollutant fractions (if simulated) in the sewer system is estimated using subroutine DWLOAD. For the particle size distribution and specific gravity discussed earlier, daily "solids" deposition is computed for DWDAYS dry-weather days (card D2) prior to the simulation. The initial pounds of deposition are printed for each conduit. This material is then eligible for erosion during the simulation (computed in subroutine QUAL). Thus, if flows increase over their initial values, (as expected during a storm) a "first flush" will be provided.**

**Footnotes to Table 6-6**

1.  **A/A = ANORM is the cross-sectional flow area divided by the cross-sectional flow area of the pipe running full. Tabular values of ANORM are generated in the program by dividing the ANORM axis (0.0 1.0) into NN1 or MM1 equal divisions.**

2.  **Q/Q<sub>f</sub> = QNORM is the flow rate divided by the flow rate of the conduit flowing full.**

3.  **y/y = DNORM is the depth of flow, y, divided by the maximum flow depth, y<sub>f</sub> (e.g., diameter of a circular conduit).**

4.  **Repeated cards have same format, i.e., 2X, F8.0, 7F10.0.**

5.  **The title from the first of any preceding blocks run will also be printed.**

6.  **The** Transport Block time step doe:; not have to equal that of a preced­ing block. The total simulation time is NDT • DT. If this is greater than that of an input file, the simulation will end earlier. Although there is no limit on the simulation time (number of time steps), output is geared toward single events only. That is, daily or monthly totals are not printed, and zeroes are not suppressed. Hence, output is inconvenient for continuous simulation, although the Transport Block can be run that way.

<!-- -->

40. Inlet hydrographs from a preceding block will automatically be accepted, but a match must be found for each inlet (element) number on the inter­face file with an element number entered in Transport.

41. These locations should include any elements for which graphical output is desired since only locations on the interface file may be plotted using the Executive Block.

42. Except in unusual cases, these errors will only indicate that a small continuity violation will occur. These errors can usually be cured by shortening the time step or increasing the length of the conduit.

43. If the time step for Transport is different than that for a preceding block, input hydrograph and pollutograph ordinates will be found by linear interpolation at the required time.

44. If both card and interface file input is used, hydrographs and polluto-graph loads entered at common locations will be summed. Transport can be run without card hydrograph input if it were desired to route only dry-weather flows (base flows).

45. Constant base flows and concentrations may be entered at manhole ele­ments (Type 16) in card group El if desired, thus eliminating the need to call FILTH or INFIL. They may still be called if desired;

> **289 6-70**
>
> **infiltration, dry-weather flow and base flow will be summed for entry at non-conduits. Base flows and concentrations entered in card group El will not be subject to daily and hourly correction factors.**

46. **"External" numbers are those assigned by the user to the various sewer system components. "Internal" numbers are assigned within the program in the order in which elements in card group El are read in. All input to the Transport Model is in** terms of external numbers.

47. **Input values on this card indicated with asterisks are multiplied by ratios, initially set equal to 1.0. If the element number = 1, non­zero data entries for parameters with asterisks will replace old values of the ratios. Ratios may be altered or reset to 1.0 any number of times. The intention of the use of ratios is to simplify sensitivity analyses, etc., by allowing easy changes of data values without repunching data cards. The altered ratios apply to all subsequent input cards (until changed by another ratio card).**

48. **Input parameters on this card indicated with asterisks will take on** default values if input, values are zero. **Tf** the element numbet'= 2, **non-zero data entries for parameters with asterisks will become new default values for all future entries of these parameters. Default values may be altered or reset to their original values (except zero) any number of times. It is not possible to reset a default value exactly torero since only non-zero values are changed. However, the value may be made arbitrarily small by u8ing E-format data entries.**

> **For example, 0.10E-50 will be read as 10 in an F8.3 format.** The altered default values apply to all subsequent input cards (until changed by another default value card).

49. For example, a two-barrelled conduit would consist of two identical parallel conduits adjacent to each other, as in a double box culvert.

50. If NFILTH .= 1 (card D3) it will be assumed that the first pollutant is BOD<sub>5,</sub> the second is suspended solids and the third is total coliforms. Hence, the selection indicated by NPOL must be in this order. The fourth pollutant, if simulated, is unaffected by the value of NFILTH.

51. See the discussion in the Runoff Block.

52. Up to the five available points (including 0.0 mm, 100%) may be used to define the particle size distribution. For instance, if a triangular distribution were satisfactory with 0.1 mm being the largest particle size, then PSIZE(2) = 0.1, PGR(2) = 0.0 would be the only entries needed.

53. May require multiple cards.

54. Be careful in subsequent blocks to ensure that element numbers will correspond to those transferred in interface file. However, any ele­ment number may be placed on the interface file, e.g., for plotting purposes.

> 290 6-71

55. See Table VIII-1, Appendix VIII, for representative values. Degree-days are not needed if RSMAX = 0.0 on card Kl, (but a blank card must still be included for card K2). Degree days are in °F-day and there is no metric input for this parameter.

56. When subroutine FILTH is used to generate dry-weather flow and pollu­tants, the only pollutants included are BOD<sub>5,</sub> suspended solids (SS) and total coliforms (T.C.). NPOLL must be 3 or 4, and the three pollutants entered in the given order in card group Fl. The fourth pollutant is arbitrary (if used) and is not affected by FILTH calculations.

57. Predicted total average daily dry-weather flow from downstream end(s) of system will be adjusted to these values.

58. If process flows are too large it is possible for ADWF - infiltration ZQPF \< 0 in which case the program defaults to KASE = 2.

59. Either-SEWAGE or else WATER is required to generate dry-weather flow from commercial areas. If both are zero, only process flows will be considered. SEWAGE and WATER should = 0 for industrial land use; for KLAND = 4, let entire flow be process flow.

60. DWLNGS and FAMILY can be used to calculate the population and then the population density. If both are given, the value of POPDEN will be overridden.

61. These industrial process flows described by SAQPF, SABPF and SASPF will be added to flows and quality already generated.

62. The program will interpolate linearly between entries of TE2 to obtain intermediate values of flow and concentrations. Hence, the difference between two time entries, TE2, should not be less than the time step, DT, unless a step function change is desired. Time entries need not be equally spaced, but the last time entered must extend past the end time of the run. Time TZERO is read from the interface file or else entered on card D2. If simulation extends beyond midnight (i.e., TE2 \> 24), continue the running time into the next day or days (i.e., let TE2 be greater than 24). Note, the time TE2 must be the same for all inlets. (The program will use the value for TE2 entered on the last inlet card.)

> STORAGE/TREATMENT BLOCK
>
> BLOCK DESCRIPTION  
> <u>Introduction</u>
>
> The Storage/Treatment Block has been developed to simulate the routing of flows and pollutants through a dry- or wet-weather storage/treatment plant containing up to five units or processes. The model will accept any number of time steps; therefore, a single-event or a continuous simulation is possible. Each unit may be modeled as having detention or non-detention characteristics.. The various units may be linked in a variety of configur­ations. Sludge handling may also be modeled using one or more units. Addi­tionally, capital cost and operation and maintenance cost may be estimated for each unit.
>
> The SIT Block will route, in addition to flow, up to three different pollutants. These pollutants may be input to the block from any external block via off-line storage, directly from cards, or a combination of both. Characterization of the pollutants may be by magnitude (i.e., concentration) or by magnitude and a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution. All input flows and pollutant concentrations are assumed to be instantanous values. However, the instantaneous values at the beginning and end of each time are used to compute average values for each time step. Thus, the user is cautioned that the output from the S/T Block consist of average values, not instantaneous values as in the rest of SWMM.

> This section describes the program operations of the S/T Block, pro­vides instructions for preparing input data cards, defines program vari­ables, and presents test applications. The user is referred to Appendix IV for theoretical development and explanations.

> <u>Program Operation</u>

> The Storage/Treatment Block is a FORTRAN program of approximately 2000 statements in length and consists of eight subroutines. The relationships among the S/T Block, the rest of SWMM and the various subroutines are shown in Figure 7-1.

> from the S/T Block transferred to other blocks is also handled by STRT (through the Executive Block). The information transferred to other blocks is discussed in the next paragraph. Subroutine STRDAT is called in STRT at the start of a run and is responsible for reading the input data describing the units, their configuration, the pollutant removal mechanisms, the method of characterizing pollutants and the remainder of the data provided by the user (excluding flow and pollutant inputs). STRDAT also prints the input data for verification. Subroutine CONTRL is called each time-step from the main driving loop in subroutine STRT. CONTRL directs flow and pollutants between units and any subsequent block. CONTRL also coordinates the account­ing and printout of detailed and summarized performance information. Flow and pollutant inputs from cards are also read in this subroutine. Sub­routine UNIT is called from subroutine CONTRL for each unit and is the heart of the S/T Block. UNIT has the flexibility and capability to model deten­tion and non-detention units with a variety of pollutant removal mechanisms, residual removal schemes and outflow structures. Subroutine EQUATE is used by UNIT to provide a variety of pollutant removal equations. Subroutine INTERP is employed by UNIT for linear interpolation in routing flows through detention units. Subroutine PLUGS is used by UNIT to model pollutant rout­ing through a detention unit when perfect plug flow is specified. <sup>-</sup>.Subroutine STCOST is called from STRT to estimate the capital cost and operation and maintenance cost for each unit.
>
> <u>Use of Off-line Computer Storage</u>
>
> No scratch data sets are required to run the Storage/Treatment Block. However, disks or tapes may be used as an input source (from an external block) or to transfer output to other blocks. This interfacing file con­sists of descriptive titles, user-supplied pollutant names and dimensions, the simulation starting date and time, the name of the external block gener­ating the output (input) file, the number of time steps and time step size, the total catchment or tributary area, the number of elements (inlets, outfalls, nonconduits, etc.) and pollutants found on the output (input) file, and the elements for which flow and pollutant data are placed (read from) the output (input) file. This preliminary information is followed by the flow and pollutant data for each time step (up to the total number of time steps) for each of the specified elements. The user should refer to Section 2 for a detailed description of the interfacing file.
>
> Flow and up to three pollutants are transferred unchanged from an input file to an output file if the data are from elements or are polluCahts not selected for use in the S/T Block. In other words, the flow and pollutant data from an input file (external block) are altered only if they pass through a storage/ treatment facility. However, the dimensions of the data on the input file will be made to conform to the standard SWHU dimensions before being placed on an output file (see Section 2). The methods of selecting these data from particular external element numbers and processing specific pollutants is discussed in the next subsection.

INSTRUCTIONS FOP DATA PREPARATION

The Storage/Treatment Block is a user-intensive model, i.e., the user should have a thorough knowledge of what he/she is modeling. This is an obvious, but often overlooked, axiom. This is especially true when a model provides<sup>.</sup>"default" values. The user in herein required to describe each unit in some detail with data of his own choosing. Storage/treatment performance depends on local pollutant characteristics, flow rates, etc.; thus, the user is encouraged to use local operating data, whenever possible, to aid in the modeling effort.

Instructions for preparing the input data cards are presented below with suggestions and examples. All entries not described in the text are considered to be self-explanatory or covered sufficiently in Table 7-3. The user is referred to this table for input format and order. All card groups are required unless otherwise stated. Figure 7-2 shows the general structure of the data deck.

<u>Preliminary Information  
Title</u> --

<u>Card Group Al</u> -- This card group allows the user to print a descriptive heading at the start of the printed output. The heading is also transferred to the next block. Two cards are required.

<u>General Information</u> --

<u>Card Group Bl</u> -- The variable NOTAPE allows the user to specify the source of flow and pollutants used for input to the S/T Block. If NOTAPE = 0, the input is provided by an external input file (arranged by the Executive Block). When NOTAPE = 1, the input is provided by card group Jl. If NOTAPE = 2, the input is the sum of the entries for each time step from the external file and card group J1. The parameter JNS selects the external element number (from an external file, NOTAPE = 0 or 2) from which flows and pollu­tants will be taken and passed through the SIT Block. If the input is provided solely by card group Jl (NOTAPE = 1 or 2), the user may label the output of the S/T Block with an element: number. When NOTAPE = 0 or 2, the variables NDT and DS are read from the external input file. However, the value of NDT from an external block may be altered<sup>-</sup>by specifying a non-zero value on card Bl. There is no limit on the number of time steps. This is useful for extending the simulation beyond the limit of the external block or input file. The value of DS from an external block will supersede any value for DS entered on card Bl.

The variable NU specifies the number of storage/treatment units, in­cluding residuals (sludge) handling units, to be modeled and the number of times that card groups Fl through Il are repeated. The model, as written, is limited to five units. However, a few program modifications can increase this limit (see later discussion). The variable NP specifies the number of pollutants to be routed through the storage/treatment system. If NP = 0, then only flows are routed. A maximum of three pollutants may be selected

**for routing. The specific pollutants are selected on card El. However, NP may not be greater than the number of pollutants transferred from other blocks (NOTAPE = 0 or 2).**

**If ICOST = 1, the cost model is called and the capital and operation and maintenance costs are computed for each unit. Cost equation parameters** are entered on card group Jl. The value of METRIC determines whether U.S. customary or metric units are used for all card input and the resulting output. The value of TRIBA is the service area of the S/T plant. It does not enter into the computations but is transferred to the next block.

<u>Starting Time and Print Instructions</u> --

<u>Card Group Cl</u> -- The values of IDATE and ITIME are used to start the date/ time algorithm of the SIT Block. The date (year, month, and day) and time (hour, minutes, and seconds) are updated for each time step. If NOTAPE = O or .2 (card Bl) the values of IDATE and ITIME read from the external file supersede the values entered on card Cl.

The user rutioned against printing large quantities of unwanted information. The first runs should have as little printout as possible (ISUM = 0 and IDET = 0) to check for obvious errors in the input data. As simulation efforts proceed, more detailed printouts may be desired.

<u>Card Group C2</u> -- These cards (up to two) are used to enter the first and last dates of the detailed print periods specified by NPR (card C1).

<u>Evaporation Data</u> --

<u>Card Group D1</u> -- Monthly evaporation rates are required to correct for evap­oration from detention units. However., two cards must be included even if there are no detention units. If needed, values of E(1) through E(12) are entered for the months during which the simulation occurs; others may be left blank.

<u>Pollutant Characterizations</u> --

> Card groups El through E6 are omitted if NP = 0 (card BI).

<u>Card Group El</u> -- These cards (up to two) allow the user to select the NP (card Bi) pollutants to be routed through the SIT Block. The variables IPOLL(1), IPOLL(2), and IPOLL(3) are used to select pollutants from an ex­ternal input file (NOTAPE = 0 or 2, card Bl). For example, if IPOLL(1) = 5, then the first pollutant routed through the S/T Block is the fifth pollutant found on the input file. If data from card group Jl are to be added to the external input file data (NOTAPE = 2, card Bl), the pollutants entered on that card group must be in the same order as specified by IPOLL(1), IPOLL(2), and IPOLL(3).

Pollutants may *be* characterized by their magnitude alone (concentration) or by their magnitude and a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution by specifying IPART(IP) = 0 or 1, respectively. If

> 297 7-6
>
> IPART(IP) = 1, the user is required to enter these distributions on card groups E2 through E6. Using these distributions, however, limits the type of unit that may be modeled (discussed in later card groups).
>
> The variables NDIM1(1), NDIM1(2), and NDIM1(3) are used to describe the dimensions of the pollutant data on card group J1 when NOTAPE = 1. When NOTAPE = 0 or 2 (card B1) this information is provided by the external input file. For example, if NDIM1(1) = 0, then the first pollutant has dimensions<sub>i</sub> of mg/l. If NDIM1(1) = 1, then the first pollutant has dimensions of liter This is used when pollutants such as coliforms are routed. When NDIM1(1) = 2, pollutant 1 has other concentration dimensions such as JTU, µmho, °C, pH, etc.
>
> The entry of pollutant names PNAME1(IN,1), PNAME1(IN,2), and PNAME1(IN,3) and dimension names PUNIT1(IN,1), PUNIT1(IN,2), and PUNIT1(IN,3) is required only when the source of flow and pollutant data is solely card group Jl (NOTAPE = 1, card Bl). If flow and pollutant data are read from ari external input file (NOTAPE = 0 or 2, card Bl) this information is already provided.
>
> Naturally, if NP = 2 (card Bl), for example, then the values for IPOLL (3), IPART(3), NOIR1(3), PNARE1(IN,3), and PUNIT1(IN,3) are not required under any circumstances. The order in which this pollutant information is entered determines the numbering of the pollutants.
>
> Card groups E2 through E6 are required only if IPART(IP) = 1 for <u>any</u> pollutant. The user is referred to Appendix IV for a more detailed discus­sion of this form of pollutant characterization.
>
> <u>Card Group E2</u> -- The variable NVS specifies the manner in which the particles in the waste stream are classified. If NVS = 0, the particles are classi­fied by size and specific gravity. The variable NNR specifies the number of size/specific gravity ranges used to delineate the distribution (up to a maximum of 10 ranges). The size/specific gravity classification remains constant throughout the simulation for each pollutant characterized in this manner. The size and specific gravity ranges are established in card groups E3 and E4. These cards and card E5 (which enters waste stream temperature data) provide the information with which an average settling velocity is computed for each range (see Appendix IV for details). If NVS = 1, the particles are classified by NNR settling velocity ranges specified on card group E3. The average settling velocity for each size range is the average of the range endpoints. Cards E4 and E5 are not required. As with the size/specific gravity ranges, this classification remains constant throughout the simulation for each pollutant characterized by settling velocity. Obviously, a particle size or settling velocity distribution may change as it passes through the storage/treatment plant. This is accomplished by altering the pollutant fractions associated with the various size/specific gravity or settling velocity ranges as they pass through the units. The initial pollutant distributions are entered on the E6 cards. These distri­butions remain constant, however, at the input to the S/T plant.

and specific gravity are shown in Table 7-1. The data presented in Table 7-1 are not default values and are presented only as a guide in setting up card groups E2 through E6. Local data, through sieve and/or settling column analyses, are always preferred.

<u>Card Group E3</u> -- These cards (up to two) are used to enter particle size (if NVS = 0, card E2) or settling velocity (if NVS= 1, card E2) ranges. A maxi­mum of ten ranges (as indicated by NNR, card E2) may be catered. The vari­ables RAN(1,1) and RAN(1,2) through RAN(NNR,1) and RAN (NNR,2) represent the lower and upper bounds of the diameters or settling velocities of particles found in ranges 1 through NNR. The ranges entered on this card remain constant through a simulation. When NVS = 0 (card E2), corresponding con­stant values of specific gravity are read on card E4.

<u>Card Group E4</u> -- These cards (up to two) are required only if NVS = 0(card E2). The variables SPG(1) through SPG(NNR) represent the specific gravity of the particles found in size ranges 1 through NNR(card E2). Literature values are shown in Table 7-1.

<u>Card Group E5</u> -- These cards (two) are required only if NVS = 0(r.-rd E2). The variables TEMP(1) through TEMP(12) represent the average wastewater temperatures for each month of the year. Water temperature has a direct ef­fect on the settling velocity of a particle. This is reflected through the viscosity of the wastewater which is a function of temperature. The user is referred to Appendix IV for details.

<u>Card Group E6</u> A set (consisting of up to two cards) of E6 cards is required for each pollutant characterized by a particle size/specific grav­ity or settling velocity distribution (IPART(1P) = 1, card El). For example, if IPART(1) = 1(card El) the variables PSD(1,1) through PSD(1, NNR) represent the fraction of pollutant 1 found in the particle size/ specific gravity or settling velocity ranges 1 through NNR entering unit 1 (all flows and pollu­tants must enter the S/T plant at unit 1). Naturally, these fractions

should sum to 1.0. Table 7-1 contains some literature values for several pollutants (particle size/specific gravity distributions only).

The distribution entering the S/T plant remains constant throughout the simulation; however, it may change as the pollutants move through the var­ious units. This is an approximation of the more probable situation in which the plant influent distributions change with time. This limitation was necessary due to the fact that no other SWMM blocks generate such dis­tributions for input to the S/T Block. However, the S/T Block can be easily modified to accept time-varying distributions should such a capability be developed in the future.

<u>Storage/Treatment Unit Information</u>

Card groups Fl through Il are repeated for each storage/treatment unit (up to NU, card Bl). The unit number, I, is determined by the order in which each set of card groups Fl through Il appears. This numbering scheme is important to the permissible configurations of units. There are two rules for numbering units; 1) flows and pollutant exiting from one unit must

be directed to a unit with a number greater than its own; and 2) all flows and pollutants entering the S/T system must enter unit 1. The flows enter­ing and exiting a unit are shown in Figure 7-3. Several examples of storage/treatment plant configurations are shown in Figure 7-4.

<u>General Unit Information</u> --

<u>Card Croup Fl</u> -- This card is used to enter the name of unit I.

<u>Card Group F2</u> -- The variable IDENT(I) describes the unit I as a nondeten-tion (IDENT(I) = 0) or detention process (IDENT(I) = 1). If IDENT(I) = 1, all or portions of card group H must be included.

Each unit is assigned a maximum inflow, QtiAX(I), beyond which all flows and pollutants are bypassed. However, this variable may be set to an ab­normally high value for design purposes (i.e., responses at all possible inputs) or set at a realistic value for modeling existing or proposed facil­ities. The variable QRF(I) is used to specify the residual flow, as a fraction of the inflow, for non-detention units only (IDENT(I) = 0).

The variables IDIREC(I,1), IDIREC(I,2) and IDIREC(I,3) are used to direct bypassed flow and pollutants, treated outflow, and residuals from unit I to other units. The values entered for these variables represent the unit numbers to which these flows and pollutants are to be directed. Addi­tionally, these flows may be sent directly to the next block (e.g., Receiving Block) or to ultimate disposal (which simply removes them from the simulation) by specifying IDIREC(I,ID) = 100 or 200, respectively. The flows and pollu­tants directed to the next block are summed for all the units and transferred as a single stream. Any unit to which flows are directed must have a unit number greater than the source unit (see Figure 7-4 for examples).

Pollutant Removal --

Pollutants are removed by settling or obstruction when characterized by particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distributions. When they are characterized by magnitude (concentration) alone, removal is simu­lated through removal equations. Card groups G1 through G3 are used to establish these removal equations. When a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution is used and the unit is classified as a non-detention process, then a critical size or settling velocity is selected. The model removes all particles with a size or settling velocity greater than or equal to the critical size. Card G4 is used to enter this parameter.

Card groups G1 through G4 are repeated for each pollutant unless a detention unit is specified (IDENT(1) = 1, card F2) and a particle size/ specific gravity or settling velocity distribution is specified for pollu­tant IP (IPART(IP) = 1, card El). Naturally, these card groups are omitted if no pollutants are routed (NP = 0, card B1). Again, card groups G1 through G3 are used only if the pollutant is characterized solely by magnitude. Card G4 is used only if a pollutant is characterized by magnitude and a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution (IPART(IP) = 1, card El) and a non-detention unit is specified (IDENT(I) = 0, card F2).

where x. = removal equation variables,

> a\. = coefficients, and
>
> R = removal fraction, 0 ≤ R ≤ 1.0.

Each removal equation variable, x., may represent, one of several parameters available in the program at each time step and these options are discussed below (card gronp G2 ). With these variables and the coefficients, a., the user can develop the desired removal equation. The coefficients are Antered on card group G3.

A maximum removal fraction is specified by RMX(I,IP) This is partic-cularly useful for equations which mathematically generate values of the removal fraction, R, that may exceed a reasonable value or 1.0. RNX(I,IP) provides an upper bound on such equations.

<u>Card Group G2</u> -- These cards (two) allow the user to assign various program variables to the variables in equation 7-1. For example, if pollutant 1 (IP = 1) is to be removed in unit I by a removal equation, the values given INPUT(I,1,1) through INPUT(I,1,11) assign program variables to the corre-

sponding variables x<sub>l</sub> through x in equation 7-1. The program variables available for inclusion are shown in Table 7-2. An example removal equation is discussed below.

<u>Card Group G3</u> -- The variables A(I,IP,3) through A(I,IP,16) represent the variables a<sub>1</sub> through a<sub>16</sub> in equation 7-1 as applied to pollutant IP in unit I. Two cards are required.

An example of applying equation 7-1 is provided by a suspended solids removal equation used in an earlier version of the Storage/Treatment Block for sedimentation (detention) units:

> SS = su.vended solids removal fraction, 0 R<sub>SS</sub> 5 R<sub>max</sub>, R<sub>max</sub> = maximum removal fraction, t<sub>d</sub> = detention time, seconds, and
>
> k = first order decay coefficient, 1/sec.

This equation can be constructed from equation 7-1 by setting a<sub>12</sub> (or A(I,

IP,12)) = R , a<sub>i</sub>, (or A(I,IP,13)) = -R , a (or A(I,IP,3)) = -k,

All other coefficients, a. (or A(I,IP,J)), would equal zero. RMX(I,IP) (card Gl) would not Ie necessary, as R<sub>max</sub> limits the value of R. Appendix IV contains other examples.

<u>Card Group G4</u> -- The variable PSC(I) specifies a critical particle size (if NVS = 0, card E2) or settling velocity (if NVS = 1, card E2) that Onotes the point above which all particles are removed from the influent. This parameter is included primarily to model such non-detention units as micro-screens, fine screens, and coarse screens. An approximation of the removal effectiveness of screens may be obtained by letting PSC(I) equal the aper­ture size of the screen (see Appendix IV). Card G4 is required <u>only</u> if IPART(IP) = 1 (card El) and IDENT(I) = 0 (card F2).

Detention Unit Data --

Card groups H1 through H8 are used to describe the special charac­teristics of detention units. Sedimentation, dissolved air floatation, chlorination, and sludge thickening are some of the processes that may be modeled by a detention unit.

These cards primarily describe the hydraulic characteristics of a detention unit and, thus, are required only if IDENT(I) = 1 (card F2).

<u>Card Group H1</u> -- The variable IROUTE(I) specifies the manner in which pol­lutants are routed in detention unit I. When IROUTE(I) = 0 the unit routes pollutants under the assumption of perfect plug flow. Perfect plug flow is recommended for long, rectangular tanks where settling is the most important removal mechanism and is <u>required</u> when <u>any</u> pollutant is characterized by a particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution (IPART(IP) = 1, card El). Removed pollutants are accumulated in plug-flow units, without decay, until removed by the residual flow. When IROUTE(I) = 1 the unit routes pollutants under the assumption of perfect miximg. Complete mixing is most applicable to small tanks where the primary purpose is to thoroughly mix the contents (e.g., rapid-mix chlorination, flocculators, and mixing tanks). Removed pollutant quantities are not allowed to accumulate in completely-mixed units (i.e., no settling). The user is referred to Appendix IV for further explanation.

The variable IOUT(I) is used to describe the depth-treated outflow relationship that characterizes the discharge of treated outflow (e.g., weir flow) from unit I. The user is given three options. The first (IOUT(I) = 0)

> 306 7-15

is to provide the model with as many as sixteen data pairs describing the depth-outflow relationship (entered on card group I3). The second option (IOUT(I) = 1) is to approximate the relationship by a power equation (entered on card H4). The third option (IOUT(I)=2) specifies a constant pumping rate between certain depths (entered on card H5).

In addition to treated outflow, a residual stream may be drawn from the unit during periods of no inflow or treated outflow. When a residual stream occurs from a plug-flow unit the entire unit contents (including the removed pollutant quantities) are mixed (i.e., the remaining plugs lose their iden­tity) and drawn off until the unit is empty or inflow occurs. If inflow begins before the unit is empty the remaining contents are placed in a single plug for further routing. In a completely-mixed unit, the pollutant concentrations in the residual flow are identical to the concentrations in the treated outflow. Again, the flow is suspended when inflow occurs. The variable IDRAW(I) simply specifies the conditions under which a residual stream begins. If IDRAW(I) = 0, a residual stream is never drawn and the accumulated pollutants (if IROUTE(I) = 0) remain in the unit. If IDRAW(I) 5 -1, the residuals are drawn off starting at every -IDRAW(I) time steps (but Ll.le flow is delayed if inflow and/ur ti:eaLed ouLilow is in progress). This option corresponds with the situation in which the unit is drained on a

regular (e.g., scheduled) basis. If IDRAW(I) 1, the residuals are drawn after IDRAW(I) time steps of no inflow or treated outflow. The conditions

specified by IDRAW(I) 1 apply directt.y to the case in which the unit contents are drained after each runoff event.

The variable IRES(I) is used to describe the depth-residual flow re­lationship that characterizes the draw off of the residual stream from unit I. If IRES(I) = 0, the user provides the model with as many as sixteen data pairs describing the depth-residual flow relationship (entered on the H3 cards). If IRES(I) = 1, the relationship is approximated by a power equa­tion (entered on card H6).

<u>Card Group H2</u> -- The parameters on this card are required <u>only</u> when a part­icle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution is used to characterize <u>any</u> pollutant (IPART(IP) = 1, card El) and unit I is a plug-flow detention unit (IROUTE(I) = 0, card Hi).

The variable ALEN(I) represents the travel length for plugs in unit I. The variable AMAN(I) is the Manning's roughness coefficient for the surfaces of unit I and is commonly available for many materials. These values are required for the pollutant removal algorithms used when a particle size/ specific gravity or settling velocity distribution characterizes a pollutant (see Appendix IV).

<u>Card Group H3</u> -- These cards are used to enter up to sixteen sets of data describing the geometry and hydraulics of detention unit I. Each card enters a value for depth, SDEPTH(I,MM), along with the corresponding values of surface area, SAREA(I,MM), volume, SSTORE(I,MM), treated outflow, SQQ0U(I,MM), and residual flow, SQQRS(I,MM). <u>The series is terminated by a</u> blank card.

> **The only required parameters are DEPTH(I,MM) and SAREA(I,MM); the need for the other parameters depends on other factors. If SSTORE(I,MM) is left blank on <u>every</u> H3 card, the program will estimate the volume at each depth by averaging the surface area at each depth and the lower adjacent depth, multiplying by the difference in depth, and adding the result to the esti­mated volume at the lower adjacent depth. A value for treated outflow, SQQOU(I,MM), is required for each depth only if IOUT(I) = 0 (card H1). If LOUT = 1 or 2 (card HI), this relationship** is provided by card 114 or caid **H5, respectively. Likewise, a value for residual flow, SQQRS(I,MM), is required for each depth only if IRES(I) = 0 (card H1). If IRES(I) = 1 (card H1), this relationship is described by card H6. The values entered for SQQRS(I,MM) are used during periods in which a residual stream is drawn from the unit (IDRAW(I), card I1).**
>
> **The values specified on these cards (or computed as a result of cards H4, H5, and H6) are used to establish relationships between depth, surface area, volume, treated outflow, and residual flow. The program also gener­ates a relationship between depth and the evaporation rate (see card group D1). These relationships are used to route flows through a detention unit Iming the Pills method (Viessman et al., 1977). This method is described in detail in Appendix IV.**

**The user supplies the values of D<sub>0</sub>, C1, and C<sub>2</sub> (program <sup>v</sup>ariables DO<sup>,</sup> Cl, and C2, respectively).**

**Two common outlet structures that may be modeled with equation 7-3 are the orifice and the broad-crested weir.

These substitutions yield the familiar weir equation.**

**<u>Card Group H5</u> -- This card is required <u>only</u> if pumping is specified for the treated outflow from a detention unit (IOUT(I) = 2, card H1). The variables DSTART(I,1) and DSTART(I,2) represent the depths at which the pumping rates QPUMP(I,1) and QPUMP(I,2) begin. The variable DSTOP(I) specifies the depth at which all pumping stops. In other words, the rate QPUMP(I,1) occurs when**

> **308 7-17**
>
> the depth is equal to or exceeds DSTART(I,1) and the rate QPUMP(I,2) occurs when the depth is greater than or equal to DSTART(I,2). The pumping rate reverts to the rate QPUMP(I,1) when the depth falls below DSTART(I,2) and continues at that rate until the depth falls to DSTOP(I). The value of DSTART(I,1) must be less than or equal to DSTART(I,2) and DSTOP(I) must be less than or equal to DSTART (1,1).

> <u>Card Group H7</u> -- This card is used to indicate the build up of sludge in a plug-flow detention unit (tROUTE(I) = 0, card H1). The user specifies the pollutant used to calculate the sludge volume, NPSL(I); the concentration of pollutant NPSL(E) in sludge; and the depth at which a warning is given to indicate that sludge has accumulated to an unacceptable level. The sludge volume is increased by dividing the amount of pollutant NPSL(I) removed each <u>time</u> step by SLDEN(I). The model assumes that the sludge volume has no effect on the available storage volume and that no compression occurs. The information on this card is only used to warn the user of a possible maintenance/performance problem.

Equations 7-9 through 7-12 differ only in the variable used to compute the operation and maintenance costs for unit I. The variable KPC(I,2) specifies which variable is used (as shown in Table 7-3) and CC(I,3), CC(I,4), and CC(I,5) represent thc<sup>,</sup>. coefficients d, f, and h.

The user is cautioned not to misinterpret the cost calculated by the model. For example, in a single-event simulation the calculated capital cost can only be considered an estimator of the true capital cost when the simulated event is a design event. Likewise, when operating time is a factor in computing operation and maintenance costs, the calculated costs can be a valid estimator of the true costs only when a long-term simulation is performed. Recent EPA publications provide useful information for the proper selection of the coefficients required in equations 7-5 through 7-12 (EPA, 1976; Benjes, 1976).

<u>Flow and Pollutant Data</u> --

> Card group Jl is required <u>only</u> if NOTAPE = 1 or 2 (card Bl).

<u>Card Group Jl</u> -- This card is repeated for <u>each</u> time step including those with no inflow. The pollutant concentrations, PCAR(IP), must be entered in the same order as on card El and have the same dimensions specified by NDIM(IP) and PUNIT(IN,IP)(card El). If NOTAPE = 2 (card BI), the flow and concentrations are added to the values from the external tape or disk. All values are instantaneous flows or concentrations (at the end of the time step).

ALTERING THE PROGRAM SIZE

The Storage/Treatment Block, as presently written, is capable of model­ing a maximum of five S/T units. To alter this restriction requires that the number 5, which appears in several lines of seven subrountines, be changed to the desired maximum. The specific subroutines and lines (num­bered in columns 72 through 80) are as follows:

SECTION 8

RECEIVING WATER BLOCK

The Receiving Water Model (Receive) has been a block of SWMM since the original SWMM development. Receive is a dynamic, branching one-dimensional network model that is often used as a pseudo-two dimensional model when the links and nodes are arranged in a triangular or other grid pattern. Based upon the EPA Dynamic Estuary Model (DEM), it is one of several variants of the DEM, and in turn, has had several other models developed based upon it. Due to the proliferation of link-node models that are direct descendants of DEM or Receive, the EPA Athens, Georgia Laboratory decided in 1980 to combine the best features of the several variants into one new Receive/DEM-type model. It was also decided that this would be the appropriate model for use with SWMM when completed. As of this writing (May 1981), work is still underway on the model and its User's Manual. Rather than publish outdated information on Receive, it was decided to use this documentation in the form of an addendum to this SWMM Version III User's Manual when it became available. Hence, no details on Receive are included herein.

Current (May 1981) Receive capabilities are relatively unchanged since the Version II SWMM (Huber et al., 1975), although a few minor changes were included with an interim SWMM release in 1977. Persons needing the Receive model should contact Mr. Tom Barnwell or Robert Ambrose of the EPA Athens lab for information on the best available version since it will not be included with the rest of the SWMM Ver­sion III release.

SECTION 9

STATISTICS BLOCK

BLOCK DESCRIPTION  
<u>Introduction</u>

The Statistics Block has been developed to provide the added capability within SWMM to perform simple statistical analyses on continuous event data. Both quantity and quality parameters may be analyzed. The options available include a table depicting the sequential series of events, a table of magni­tude, return period and frequency of events, a graph of magnitude vs. retura period, a graph of magnitude vs. frequency, and the first three moments of the event data.

Statistical analyses are performed on data read from an interface file arranged in the standardized SWMM format (refer to Section 2). The Statis­tics Block may be called after any block that generates such a file. In addition, the user may create an interface file of rainfall or other data and, through an understanding and alteration of various conversion factors, use the Statistics Block to analyze rainfall, rather than stormwater events.

Separation of the data into events depends on the unique series of zero and non-zero instantaneous flow values found at each location within the system being simulated. The results of the analyses would be expected to vary from location to location. The Statistics Block handles only one location at a time.

This section describes the program operation of the Statistics Block, identifies output options, provides instructions for preparing input data cards, defines program variables, presents the equations utilized within the block and explains the messages and labels that may be printed.

<u>Program Operation</u>

The Statistics Block is a Fortran program of approximately 1500 state­ments in length and consists of six subroutines. The relationships among the Statistics Block, the rest of SWMM and the various subroutines are shown in Figure 9-1.

The subroutine STATS comprises the major portion of the block. Input data and data from the interface file are read in STATS. Descriptive infor­mation from the file header is printed, followed by a summary of the input data. STATS separates the flow/pollutant data into events and writes this

new data set on an off-line file. The write statement contains 561 bytes. Using disk storage with 19500 bytes per track, data for 34 events can be stored on one track. With an internal program limit of 3750 events, 111 tracks of disk storage are required for the Statistics Block. The limit of 3750 can be changed, resulting in a change in off-line storage requirements.

After the entire simulation period has been examined, a table of the sequential series of events is printed (if requested). If a table of return period and frequency or a graph of either of these is requested, SORT is called to sort the series into descending order. SBTABL is utilized to generate and print the table of magnitude, return period and frequency. POINTS is called prior to CURVE. POINTS generates an array of (X,Y) pairs to be plotted as points on either the return period or frequency graph. CURVE and PPLOT are part of the Executive Block and are used to print the graphs. MOMENT calculates and prints the mean, variance, standard devia­tion, coefficient of variation and coefficient of skewness of the event data. LABELS is a Block Data subroutine utilized for initializing constants in labeled common blocks that are used for labeling graphs and other output.

<u>Output Options</u>

The table of sequential series of events depicts the original time series of flow data after the time steps have been grouped into events. The table includes the date and time of day that each event began, flow volume of each event, duration of each event and interevent durations. The table of magnitude, return period and frequency is a rank order table showing the date and time that each event began, the magnitude of the event being ana­lyzed, the return period (in months) of that magnitude and the percent of occurrences that are less than or equal to the given magnitude. The graph of magnitude vs. return period is a plot of two columns of the table, except that return period is presented as the base ten logarithm. The graph of magnitude vs. frequency is a similar plot with frequency presented as a per­cent. Although the graphing routines plot information centered in the table, it is not necessary to select the table option in order to select the graph options. Any of these may be printed independently of the others. The last option available is a calculation of a number of sample statistics of the event data (enumerated above).

The table of sequential series pertains only to the volume of the flow events. The remaining options can be requested for flow or pollutants. Any (or all) of these can be selected for any (or all) of the five flow parame­ters and for any (or all) of the five pollutant parameters. Different pol­lutant parameters can be analyzed for different pollutants. Events are identified on the basis of zero and nonzero flow values so that the duration of events and interevents will be identical for flow and any of the pollu-. tants selected.

<u>Potential for Output</u>

<u>Sequential Series of Events</u> --

This option prints a table of the original series of events before any sorting has taken place. Printing of the table, which contains 120 events

**per page, may bt! accessed in several ways. First, the table may be printed directly as an option under normal program execution. Second, when the num­ber of events in the time series exceeds the designated limit and termination of the program has not been requested, the table may be printed (ignoring the rest of the series). Third, in the case where termination has been selected, the option remains to print a table for that portion of the series Lhat has been separated into events.**

**<u>Table of Magnitude, Return Period and Frequency</u> --**

**For those parameters where this option is requested, one table will be printed for each parameter chosen for each constitutent chosen. For example, if, for the constitutent 'FLOW', two parameters are chosen (e.g., total flow and event duration), and for each of two pollutants two parameters are chosen (e.g., total load and peak concentration), then six separate tables are printed, each containing magnitude, return period and frequency for the appropriate parameter. Therefore, although it is unlikely that one would have reason to do so, up to 55 tables can be printed in one run (five flow parameters, and five pollutant parameters for ten pollutants). The length** of eaoh table depends on the number **of events within the period of analysis (180 events are printed per page).**

**<u>Graph of Magnitude vs. Return Period or Graph of Magnitude vs. Frequency</u> --**

**The following discussion refers to either type of graph. As with the tables above, one graph is printed for each parameter chosen of each constit­uent for which a graph is requested. Each graph comprises one page of output. Again, up to 55 graphs can be printed, although this would be an unlikely choice.**

**<u>Moments</u> --**

**This option calculates and prints unbiased estimates for the mean, vari­ance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation and coefficient of skew­ness. These values will be printed for each parameter chosen for each con­stituent chosen. The output incorporates approximately 15 lines and will appear in sequence where space is available (i.e., a new page is not printed for each set of moments).**

**PREPARATION OF INPUT DATA  
<u>Extent of Data </u>**

**The Statistics Block requires a minimal amount of input data under nor­mal use. The flow/pollutant data to be analyzed will be read from interface files generated by other blocks of SWMM. The input data required simply indicate what type of analysis should be performed on the interface data. Use of the block for rainfall data will be discussed in a later subsection.**

**Card by card instructions for preparing the input data cards will be presented. The user is referred to Table 9-2 at the end of this section for**

> The variable ISTART and TSTART indicate the date and time, respec­tively, at which the program should begin searching for events. The vari­able IEND and TEND indicate the last point on the file that should be read. In this manner, the user can choose any period within the record (e.g., one particular year, five sequential years, etc) on which to perform statistical analyses. Default values of zero for both date and time can be chosen for starting and/or ending. Zero starting values indicate that analyses should commence with the first value on the interface file. Zero ending values indicate that analyses should continue to the end of the available record. Formats for date and time correspond to the standardized interface format.

> The minimum interevent time (MIT) indicates the minimum number of dry time steps (time steps with zero flow) that will constitute an interevent. In other words, the number of consecutive dry time steps encountered in the search must be equal to or greater than MIT in order that the preceding wet period (made up of at least one nonzero flow value) be considered a separate event. Dry periods of duration less than MIT may exist within an event preceded and followed by wet time steps. The number of events in a given period of analysis is directly dependent on the value of MIT. A value of zero may be chosen for MIT; in this manner every wet time step will be viewed as a separate event. No "correct" value of MIT can be suggested, although a value of 6 to 22 hrs is often used to separate <u>rainfall</u> events (Heaney et al., 1977). The value utilized depends on the criteria employed by the user in defining an event.

> The variable array IPOLRQ will contain up to ten elements, corres­ponding to the maximum value of NPR (and NPOLL). The pollutants requested for analysis must be identified by their position on the interface file (not by name). Therefore, the elements of IPOLRQ will contain integer values from 1 to 1O. For example, if the first pollutant to be analyzed is BOD, and BOD is the third pollutant on the interface file, then IPOLRQ(1) would have the value 3. Similarly, if the second pollutant to be analyzed is TSS, and TSS is the fifth pollutant on the interface file, then IPOLRQ(2) would have the value 5.

Card C2 is for a graph of magnitude vs. return period. Card C3 is for a graph of magnitude vs. fre­quency. Card C4 is for a table of the first three moments of the event data. There are five fields on each card, one field for each of the five flow parameters. The five parameters are (1) total flow for the event, measured as a volume and reported as inches \[mm\], (2) average flow for the event, measured as a rate and reported as inches/hour \[mm/hr\], (3) peak flow for the event, measured as an instantaneous rate and reported as inches/hour \[mm/hr\], (4) duration of the event, measured as the number of time steps making up the event and reported as hours, and (5) duration of the inter-event, measured as the number of dry time steps preceding the event and reported as hours. For a given card, those fields containing a 1 indicate the flow parameters for which that option has been selected. Values of zero indicate that the analyses should not be performed.

The "D" cards should be arranged as a group (D1-D4), with groups of cards in a sequence corresponding to the order in which the pollutants were requested. Again, there are five fields on each card, one field for each of the five pollutant parameters. The five parameters are (1) total load, measured as a sum of the concentration times the flow rate and reported as pounds \[kg\], (2) average load, measured as a rate of pollutant loading and reported as lbs/hour \[kg/hr\], (3) peak load, measured as an instantaneous rate of pollu­tant loading and reported as lbs/hour \[kg/hr\], (4) flow weighted average concentration, reported as mg/1, and (5) peak concentration, reported as mg/l. As noted in Table 9-2, at least one set of Dl-D4 cards must be included. If NPR = 0, all "D" cards would contain zero values (or be left blank).

<u>Card Groups G1 and G2</u>

The variable KTERM indicates whether or not to terminate analyses in the case where the number of events exceeds the allowable computer memory space. The number of events that can be sorted and analyzed has been set within the program at 3750. This value corresponds to 150 events per year for a 25 year period. As noted at the beginning of the STATS subroutine, this value may be altered by the user. If the number of events exceeds the limit set, the program will either (a) perform the analyses on the events already identified, ignoring the remainder of the record (KTERM = 0), or (b) terminate execution of the block, performing no event analysis (KTERM = 1). If the analyses are being performed, a table of the sequential series will be printed if KSEQ = 1. If the analyses are not performed, the option still exists to print the table of sequential series before termination. The variable KTSEQS indicates that the table should or should not be printed in this case.

COMPUTATIONS

<u>Return Period and Frequency</u>

The logic of the program is described by comment statements at the beginning of each subroutine and throughout the program listing. Computa­tions that require further explanation will be discussed.

In subroutine STATS, the variables Ti and T2 indicate the beginning and end, respectively, of the period of analysis. The values are reported as elapsed time from the beginning of the simulation, measured in hours. The return period of an event of a given magnitude is reported as months so that a calculation of, the number of months (NOMOS) within the period of analysis is required. The average number of hours per month in a year of 365.25 days is 730.5. This value is used to find a value for NOMOS, rounded to the nearest month, by the equation

<td><p>NOMOS = Integer <sup><u>((T2-T1)</u></sup> + 0.5 1'</p>
<p>730.5</p></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For short periods of analysis (e.g., on the order of one year) NOMOS may be in error by one month depending on which months of the year are included in the period. This should pose little difficulty as a return period analysis for such a short period is generally not undertaken (or at best is of questionable worth).

In subroutine TABLES, calculations are made of the return period and frequency of events. The program is set up in such a way that the equation used depends on the column of the table in which the values will be printed. These calculations are summarized in the general forms

The labels printed for the ordinate of the graphs are also presented.**

>
> **The user is referred to Sections 2 and 4 for an introduction to the variable NDIM. For NDIM = 0, pollutant concentration is given in mg/l. In this case, a direct conversion is possible for loading rates and concentra­tions. For NDIM = 1, pollutant concentration is given in "other quantity" per liter (e.g., MPN/1). Here, no conversion is possible to mass loading or mass per unit volume. "Mass" must be presented** as **"quantity" and the user must be aware of what "quantity" refers to for** the **pollutant involved. The units printed for flow weighted average concentration and peak concentration will correspond to the variable PUNIT found on the interface file for the particular pollutant. For NDIM = 2, pollutant concentration is given in some other units, not on a "per liter" basis (e.g., JTU). Therefore, no units conversion can be made. Magnitudes reported for total load will have units of a volume multiplied by the appropriate PUNIT. The magnitude is obtained by summing the pollutant values found on the interface file (which are in units of an instantaneous flow rate multiplied by a concentration) and multiplying this value by the time step size (DTSEC) of the event. Interpretation of the significance of these magnitudes is left strictly to the user, who should exercise caution in selecting this statistical option. A similar caution applies to average load and peak load. These magnitudes will have units of a flow rate multiplied by the appropriate PUNIT. The average load is the mean of the values found on the interface file for a given event, with a units conversion for flow rate. The peak load is the largest of the values within an event, with a similar units conversion for flow rate. Flow weighted average concentration and peak concentration will have units corresponding to PUNIT for the particular pollutant and an inter­pretation of these magnitudes may *be* simpler than the above parameters. The calculation of these two parameters is self-evident.**

APPENDIX I

CONTINUOUS SIMULATION

CONTINUOUS AND SINGLE EVENT SIMULATION

The original Storm Water Management Model, designed for single event simulation, produced detailed (i.e., short time increment) hydrographs and pollutographs for individual storm events. Although this capability remains, the model has now been altered. so that it may be run for an unlimited number of time steps, for multiple events. In this mode it may be used in a plan­ning context, that is, for an overall assessment of urban runoff problems sad estimates cf the effectiveness and costs of abatement procedures. Trade­offs among various control options, such as storage, treatment and street sweeping, may be evaluated. Complex interactions between the meteorology, e.g., precipitation patterns, and the hydrology of an area may be simulated without resorting to average values or very simplified methods. In this manner, critical events from the long period of simulation may be selected for detailed analysis. In addition, return periods for intensity, duration and volume (mass) of runoff (pollutant loads) may be assigned on the basis of the simulated record instead of incorrectly equating them to the same statistics of the rainfall record. In this manner, the critical events chosen for study may be substituted for hypothetical "design storms", the latter often being synthesized from intensity-duration-frequency curves on the basis of questionable statistical assumptions. Linsley and Crawford (1974) present a useful discussion of continuous simulation in urban hydrology.

Several continuous simulation models are available for urban runoff analysis. Among the earliest was the Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), out of which evolved the HSPF Model (Johanson et al., 1980), a versatile program for natural and agricultural as well as urban areas. It uses a 15 minute time step whereas a 5 minute time step is used by the Dorsch QQS model (Geiger et al., 1974, Geiger and Dorsch, 1980). Probably the most widely used continuous simulation model for urban areas is STORM (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1977, Rosener et al., 1974), developed by Water Resources Engineers, the City of San Francisco and the Hydrologic Engineering Center of the Corps of Engineers. It utilizes one hour time steps coupled with simplified runoff and pollutant estimation procedures and has been extensively used for planning (Roesner et al., 1974) and overall urban runoff evaluation (Heaney et al., 1977). A similar, but even simpler model, still producing useful statistics of long-term urban runoff, is the Simplified Storm Water Management Model developed by Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. (Lager et al., 1976). Finally, several "first cut" procedures have been developed, based in part upon continuous simulation, but avoiding any computer usage at all (Hydro-science, Inc., 1976, Howard, 1976, Heaney et al., 1976, Chan and Bras, 1979).

> 367 I-1
>
> CONTINUOUS SWIM OVERVIEW
>
> SWMM is run continuously using only the Runoff and Storage/Treatment (S/T) blocks. Routing in Transport, WRE Transport (EXTRAN) or Receiving is avoided and is unnecessary for the planning purposes to which the model is applied. (However, there is no limitation on the number of time steps for either Extran, Transport or Receive). A "Level III" receiving water model that will couple with either continuous SWHM or STORM has been developed based upon earlier work (Heaney et al., 1977) and is documented (Medina, 1979). The algorithms used in Runoff and S/T are almost identical when run continuously or as a single event model, the only differences occuring in a minor way in the snowmelt routines. A one-hour time step is required when the model receives input from National Weather Service (NWS) precipitation and temperature tapes, which will be true for most applications. Although other time steps may be used, the output is generally formated for an assumed 24 time steps per day. In fact, inclusion of daily, monthly and annual totals along with a few other I/O features forms about the only distinction between the continuous and single event mode.
>
> It is anticipated that continuous, long-term simulation will only be used with a very coarse, "lumped" or aggregated catchment schematization in order to minimize computer costs. For example, only one subcatchment and no gutter/pipes will often suffice.
>
> SNOWMELT
>
> Following the earlier work of the Canadian SWMM study by Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren (1976a, 1976b) snowmelt simulation has been added for both single event and continuous simulation. Since snowmelt com­putations are explained in detail in Appendix II, only an outline is given here. Most techniques are drawn from Anderson's (1973) work for the National Weather Service (NWS). For continuous simulation, daily max-min temperatures from the NWS "WSAN Summary of the Day, Deck 345" are converted to hourly values by sinusoidal interpolation.
>
> Urban snow removal practices may be simulated through "redistribution fractions" input for each subcatchment (see Figure II-6 in Appendix II), through alteration of the melt coefficients and base temperatures for-the regions of each subcatchment, and through the areal depletion curves•used for continuous simulation. Anderson's temperature-index and heat balance melt equations are used for melt computations during dry and rainy periods, respectively. For continous simulation, the "cold content" of the pack is maintained in order to "ripen" the snow before melting. Routing of melt water through the snow pack is performed as a simple reservoir routing pro­cedure, as in the Canadian study.
>
> The presence of a snow pack is assumed to have no effect on overland flow processes beneath it. Melt is routed in the same manner as rainfall.

368 I-2

> INPUT DATA
>
> Continuous SWMM requires all data entries previously required except that a coarse schematization greatly reduces the amount of entries required for subcatchments and gutter/pipes (see below). The key data need is a long­term precipitation record for the area. SWMM is keyed to the use of magnetic tapes available from the National Weather Records Center of the NWS at Ashe­ville, North Carolina. These tapes contain card images of "NWS Card Deck 488, USWB Hourly Precipitation" and cost approximately \$200 per station for a 25 year record of hourly precipitation totals. (Similar tapes are supplied in Canada by the Atmospheric Environment Service.) When snowmelt is simu­lated, a record of daily temperature data is also required; see the snowmelt documentation in Appendix II. These data are processed in subroutine CTRAIN in Runoff for later use by the other routines in the block. Optionally, the processed data, including a tabulation of the 50 highest values, may be exam­ined prior to proceeding with the remainder of the simulation. When snowmelt is simulated, rainfall or snowfall is determined from hourly air temperatures synthesized from the daily max-min values for the station. Snowfall values are keyed as negative precipitation for internal use in the program.
>
> Other input data unique to continuous simulation consist mainly of dates for starting and stopping, printing, etc. In addition, NWS Station ID num­bers must be known for the precipitation and temperature tapes.
>
> CATCHMENT SCHEMATIZATION
>
> Guidelines for subcatchment "lumping" or aggregation are given by Smith (1975) and Proctor and Redfern, Ltd. and James F. MacLaren, Ltd. (1976a, 1976b). In general, almost identical outlet hydrographs may be produced using only one subcatchment and one or no gutter/pipes as for a detailed schematization, using several subcatchments and gutter/pipes. A key param­eter to be adjusted is the subcatchment width. Quality comparisons may be more variable depending upon how the several land uses and/or pollutant loading rates are aggregated.
>
> OUTPUT
>
> <u>Runoff Block</u>
>
> Output from single event simulation consists basically of hydrographs and pollutographs printed over the whole event at a specified interval of time steps (e.g., every time step). Continuous SWMM retains this option for up to five user-specified date intervals. In addition, daily, monthly, annual and grand total values for runoff, precipitation and pollutant loads are provided. Daily totals are printed whenever there is runoff and/or pre­cipitation.
>
> In addition, the 50 highest hourly totals are listed, by both runoff volume and BOD load. These may be compared to the 50 highest hourly rainfall depths and used in selecting critical time periods for more detailed study.
>
> 369 I-3
>
> **For example, a two-year simulation of a 312 ac (126 ha) catchment tributary to Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis was made, and the ten highest rainfall, runoff and BOD loads (from the output of the 50 highest) are shown in Table I-1. The comparisons indicate that the rankings differ according to antecedent conditions, etc. affecting each parameter. For example, the highest rainfall depth corresponds to the third highest runoff depth and second highest BOD load. The table adds further justification to the contention that it is necessary to treat rainfall, runoff and pollutant loads separately in terms of statistical analyses.**
>
> **The most useful review of continuous SWMM output is probably accomplished using the Statistics Block. Therein a frequency analysis of many storm quan­tity and quality parameters (e.g., depth, duration, interevent time, load, peak concentration, etc.) may be performed. Output is available in both tabular and graphical forms. Analysis by the Statistics Block may follow** any other block (except Receive).
>
> <u>Storage/Treatment Block</u>
>
> There is no distinction made between output for a single event or con­tinuous simulation in the Storage/Treatment Block. Regardless of the number of time steps specified, the user has the option of printing a detailed report for each time step during eight different intervals (or less), a monthly summary, an annual summary, and/or a final summary. Of course, the monthly and annual summaries have little value in a single event simulation and should only be used for long-term runs.
>
> DRY-PERIOD REGENERATION  
> <u>Quantity</u>
>
> Infiltration capacity is regenerated during dry periods assuming an ex­ponential "drying curve" analogous to the "wetting curve" of Horton's equa­tion (see Appendix V). Monthly evaporation totals are used to regenerate depression storage on both pervious and impervious areas and are also con­sidered an initial "loss" for each time step with rainfall. Computations are bypassed during dry periods if infiltration and depression storage re­generation is complete.
>
> <u>Quality</u>
>
> Pollutant loadings on the subcatchment surfaces are regenerated during dry time steps (i.e, no runoff) depending upon how they are input initially. Linear or non-linear buildup may be used, with or without an upper limit. If desired, a rating curve (load versus flow) may be used instead of a washoff equation.
>
> Street sweeping occurs at intervals specified for each land use. The intervals are computed on the basis of intervening dry time steps. A dry time step is one in which the subcatchment receives no precipitation and has no water remaining in impervious area depression storage or as snow. When suowmelt is simulated, street sweeping may be bypassed for a specified

> Runoff simulates any ten quality parameters with arbitrary units, plus, optionally, erosion using the Universal Soil Loss Equation. As a user op­tion, regeneration of selected constituents (e.g, chlorides) during dry periods will occur only when snow is present.
>
> CONTINUOUS SWIM COMPARED TO STORM
>
> Preliminary comparisons of SWMM and STORM, without S/T simulation, in­dicate that the two outputs are comparable and STORM is approximately 50 percent cheaper (see Appendix II). Why, then, might SWMM be used over STORM or other existing continuous models? When just the Runoff Block is required, STORM could be the choice because of its simplicity, good documentation, useful output and inclusion of the SCS method for rural runoff generation. SWMM might be preferred if flow routing in gutter/pipes were desired or par­ticular features of runoff or quality generation were needed. In addition, SWMM now couples both the single event and continuous simulation capability into one model.
>
> The principal advantage of continuous SWMM lies in its Storage/Treat-ment block described in Appendix IV. Several pathways among and through the various storage and/or treatment devices may be utilized instead of one fixed configuration. Most importantly, the treatment that occurs in storage as well as sludge generation by all control options, may be simulated by SWMM. Finally, SWMM S/T will compute operation and maintenance costs on the basis of actual hours of operation of wet-weather treatment devices, providing more realistic cost data.

APPENDIX II

SWMM SNOWMELT ROUTINES

INTRODUCTION

Snowmelt is an additional mechanism by which urban runoff may ***be*** gener­ated. Although flow rates are typically low, they may be sustained over several days and remove a significant fraction of pollutants deposited dur­ing the winter. Rainfall events superimposed upon snowmelt baseflow may produce higher runoff peaks and volumes as well as add to the melt rate of the snow.

In the context of long term, continuous simulation, runoff and pollu­tant loads are distributed quite differently in time between the cases when snowmelt is and is not simulated. The water and pollutant storage that occurs during winter months in colder climates cannot be simulated without including snowmelt.

Several hydrologic models include snowmelt computations, e.g., Stanford Watershed Model (Crawford and Linsley, 1966), HSPF (Johanson et al., 1980), NWS (Anderson, 1973, 1976), STORM (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1977, Roesner et al., 1974) and SSARR (Corps of Engineers, 1971). Of these exam­ples, only HSPF and STORM include pollutant routing options. Useful summa­ries of snowmelt modeling techniques are available in texts by Fleming (1975), Eagleson (1970), Linsley et al. (1975), Viessman et al. (1977), and Gray (1970). All of these draw upon the classic work, <u>Snow Hydrology,</u> of the Corps of Engineers (1956).

As part of a broad program of testing and adaptation to Canadian condi­tions, a snowmelt routine was placed is SWMM for single event simulation by Proctor and Redfern, Ltd. and James F. MacLaren, Ltd., abbreviated PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b, 1977), during 1974-1976. The basic melt computations were based on routines developed by the U. S. National Weather Service, NWS (Anderson, 1973). The work reported herein has utilized the Canadian SWMM snowmelt routines as a starting point and has considerably augmented their capabilities as well as added the facility for snowmelt computations while running continuous SWMM. In addition, features have been added which aid in adapting the snowmelt process to urban conditions since most efforts in the past, except for STORM, have been aimed at simulation of spring melt in large river basins. The work of the National Weather Service (Anderson, 1973) has also been heavily utilized, especially for the extension to continuous simu­lation and the resulting inclusion of cold content, variable melt coefficients and areal depletion.

> 373 II-1
>
> The following sections describe the methodology presently programmed in the SWMM Runoff Block. It is intended to aid in understanding the various input parameters required, computations performed, and output produced.
>
> OVERVIEW  
> <u>E-w Dcpths</u>
>
> Throughout the program, all snow depths are treated as "depth of water equivalent" to avoid specification of the specific gravity of the snow pack which is highly variable with time. The specific gravity of new snow is on the order of 0.09; an 11:1 or 10:1 ratio of snow pack depth to water equiva­lent depth is often used as a rule of thumb. With time, the pack compresses until the specific gravity can be considerably greater, to 0.5 and above. In urban areas, lingering snow piles may resemble ice more than snow, with specific gravities approaching 1.0. Although snow pack heat conduction and storage depend on specific gravity, sufficient accuracy may be obtained without using it. It is adequate to maintain continuity through the use of &loth of water equivalent.
>
> Most input parameters are in units of inches of water equivalent (in. w.e.). For all computations, conversions are made to feet of water equiva­lent.
>
> <u>Single Event Simulation</u>
>
> For single event simulation, it is unnecessary to generate a long rec­ord of precipitation and temperature data. Snow quantities are input as initial depths (water equivalent) on subcatchments and as negative rainfall intensities on rainfall input cards. Snowfall is generally keyed as nega­tive precipitation on input files. TeTperature data are read for each time step from card input. (Other parameters are explained subsequently.)
>
> During the simulation, melt is generated at each time step using a degree-day type equation during dry weather and Anderson's NWS equation (1973) during rainfall periods. Specified, constant areas of each sub-catchment are designated as snow covered. Melt, after routing through the remaining snow pack, is combined with rainfall to form the spatially weighted "effective rainfall" for overland flow routing in the same manner as in the past.
>
> <u>Continuous Simulation</u>
>
> For continuous simulation, hourly precipitation depths from NWS magnet­ic tapes are utilized along with daily max-min temperatures from other NWS tapes. The latter are interpolated sinusoidally to produce hourly tempera­ture values, as explained in detail in the next subsection. If temperatures are below a dividing value (e.g., 32°F), precipitation values are treated as snow and keyed with a negative sign. The hourly temperatures are also used in the melt computations.
>
> 374 11-2
>
> Melt is again generated using a degree-day type equation during dry weather and Anderson's NWS equation during rainfall periods. In addition, a record of the cold content of the snow is maintained. Thus, before melt can occur, the pack must be "ripened", that is, heated to a specified base tem­perature.
>
> One partition of the urban subcatchment is the "normally bare impervi­ous area." This is intended to represent surfaces such as streets, parking lots and sidewalks which are subject to plowing or snow "redistribution". The program includes this feature.
>
> Following the practice of melt computations in natural basins, "areal depletion curves" describe the spatial extent of snow cover as the pack melts. For instance, shaded areas would be expected to retain a snow cover longer than exposed areas. Thus, the snow covered area of each subcatchment changes with time during continuous simulation.
>
> Melt computations themselves proceed as in the single event simulation, except that the degree-day melt coefficients vary sinusoidally, from a maxi­mum on June 21 to a minimum on December 21.
>
> <u>Pollutant Simulation</u>
>
> Pollutant washoff is simulated as in the past using combined runoff from snowmelt and/or rainfall. For continuous SWMM, regeneration of any pollutant may depend upon whether snow cover is present if, for example, chlorides are to be simulated.
>
> SNOW AND TEMPERATURE GENERATION FROM NWS TAPES  
> <u>National Weather Service (NWS) Data</u>
>
> As explained in the description, continuous SWMM and other continuous simulation models utilize long-term precipitation and temperature data ob­tained from the National Weather Records Center (NWRC) at Asheville, North Carolina for the nearest NWS or airport weather station of record. If snow-melt is not simulated only the precipitation tape is needed; hourly precipi­tation totals are included on it for every day with measureable precipita­tion, plus for the first day of each month whether or not there is precipi­tation. For continuous SWMM without snowmelt, all such hourly values are treated as rainfall.
>
> Maximum and minimum temperatures as well as several other meteorologi­cal parameters are given for every day of the year on the NWRC's "WBAN Summary of Day, Deck 345". A card is illustrated in Figure II-1. Only the ID number, date and max-min temperatures are used although other data may be useful for other purposes. Note that the five-digit ID number is not neces-sarily the same as for the hourly precipitation data. The program, in sub­routine CTRAIN, accesses a magnetic tape containing card images of data shown in Figure II-1. The unit number of the tape is input in the executive Block as NSCRAT(3).

>
> <u>Creation of Hourly Temperatures</u>
>
> **The ."WBAN Summary of Day" or temperature tape does not list the time of day at which the minimum and maximum temperatures occur. Hence, the minimum temperature is <u>assumed</u> to occur at sunrise each day, and the maximum is <u>assumed</u> to occur three hours prior to sunset. All times are rounded to the nearest hour. This scheme obviously cannot account for many meteorological phenomena that would create other temperature-time distributions but is apparently the most appropriate one under the** circumstances. Given the max-min temperatures and their assumed hours of occurrence, the other 22 hourly temperatures are readily created by sinusoidal interpolation, as sketched in Figure II-2. The interpolation is performed, using three differ­ent periods, **1)** between the maximum of the previous day and the minimum of the present, 2) between the minimum and maximum of the present, and 3) between the maximum of the present and minimum of the following.
>
> The time of day of sunrise and sunset are easily obtained as a function of latitude and longitude of the catchment and the date. Techniques for these computations are explained, for example, by List (1966) and by the TVA (1972). The program, in subroutine CTRAIN, utilizes approximate (but suffi­ciently accurate) formulas given in the latter reference. Their use is ex­plained briefly below.
>
> The hour angle of the sun, h, is the angular distance between the in­stantaneous meridian of the sun (i.e., the meridian through which passes a line from the center of the earth to the sun) and the meridian of the obser­ver (i.e., the meridian of the catchment). It may be measured in degrees or radians or readily converted to hours, since 24 hours is equivalent to 360 degrees or 2n radians. The hour angle is a function of latitude, declination of the earth and time of day and is zero at noon, true solar time, and posi­tive in the afternoon. However, at sunrise and sunset, the solar altitude of the sun (vertical angle of the sun measured from the earth's surface) is zero, and the hour angle is computed only as a function of latitude and dec­lination,
>

> **The earth's declination is provided in tables (e.g., List, 1966), but for programming purposes, an approximate formula is used (TVA, 1972):**

>
> **h = <sup>11</sup> • ccs<sup>-1</sup> (-tan 6 • tan 0 (II-3)**
>
> **The computation is valid for any latitude between the arctic and antarctic circles, and no correction is made for obstruction of the horizon.**
>
> **The hour of sunrise and sunset is symmetric about noon, true solar time. True solar noon occurs when the sun is at its highest elevation for the day. It differs from standard zone time, (i.e., the time on clocks) because of a longitude effect and because of the "equation of time". The latter is of astronomical origin and causes a correction that varies season­ally between approximately ± 15 minutes. It is neglected here. The longi­tude correction accounts for the time difference due to the separation of the meridian of** the observer and the meridian of the standard time zone. These are listed in Table II-1. It is readily computed as

>
> 0 = longitude of the observer, degrees, and
>
> SM = standard meridian of the time zone, degrees, from Table
>
> II-1.
>
> Note that DTLONG can be either positive or negative, and the sign should be retained. For instance, Boston at approximately 71°W has DTLONG = -16 min­utes, meaning that mean solar noon precedes EST noon by 16 minutes. (Mean solar time differs from true solar time by the neglected "equation of time".)

>
> HSS = 12 + h + DTLONG/60.
>
> These times are rounded to the nearest hour for use in continuous SWMM since hourly time steps are used. If shorter time steps are allowed in the future, such rounding could be removed. As stated earlier, the maximum temperature is assumed to occur at hour HSS - 3.
>
> Standard time is used in all calculations and in NWS tapes. There is no input or output that includes allowance for daylight savings time.

> **Snowfall depths are tagged as negative quantities for identification by later components of the program.**
>
> **<u>Gage Catch Deficiency Correction</u>**
>
> **Precipitation gages tend to produce inaccurate snowfall measurements because of the complicated aerodynamics of snow flakes falling into the gage. Snowfall totals are generally underestimated as a result, by a factor that varies considerably depending upon gage exposure, wind velocity and whether or not the gage has a wind shield. The program includes a parameter, SCF, which multiplies snow depths only, as computed using equation II-7. Although it will vary considerably from storm to storm, it acts as a mean correction factor over a season in the model. Anderson (1973) provides typical values of SCF as a function of wind speed, as shown in Figure II-3, which may be helpful in establishing an initial estimate. The value of SCF can also be used to account for other factors, such as losses of snow due to interception and sublimation not accounted for in the model. Anderson (1973) states that both losses are usually small compared to the gage catch deficiency.**
>
> **<u>Structure of Precipitation - Temperature Data Set</u>**
>
> **Output from subroutine CTRAIN is placed as a file on off-line storage unit number NSCRAT(2) as diagrammed in Figure II-4. If snowmelt is not sim­ulated, only hourly rainfall intensities (in feet/second) are placed on the unit, in blocks of eight 24 hour days, for 192 values. No other parameters (e.g., dates) are included.**
>
> **When snowmelt is run, the subroutine first makes all the temperature calculations, and stores these temporarily on unit NSCRAT(1). (This volum­inous file may optionally be printed for error checking.) These values are then retrieved Eor utilization with the precipitation tape. The final file is stored on unit NSCRAT(2) in the form day number/hour, temperature, pre­cipitation, day number/hour, temperature, precipitation, etc., to 192 groups of three, as diagrammed in Figure II-4. The day number/hour parameter is IDTHR where the first three digits are the day of the year and the last two are the hour of the day, (e.g., for noon on February 3, IDTHR = 03412). The year is not included and must be calculated knowing the date of the initial entry on the file. This file may also be printed for debugging purposes but will produce voluminous output.**
>
> **For most purposes, it will be best to use appropriate job control language (JCL) to save permanently the file on NSCRAT(2) for future repeated use. This avoids reprocessing the NWS tapes; reuse is available as a pro­gram option by setting ICRAIN = 2. The JCL required to do this is highly**

**<u>Output Options</u>**

> **Depending upon the value of IRPRNT, all non-zero, hourly precipitation**

values may be printed along with **either all <u>'tad</u> hourly temperatures for all days, or only the max-min temperatures for all days. In addition, the 50 highest hourly precipitation intensities are printed to aid in choos­ing critical events for detailed simulation. At the option of the user, the program will stop at this point, by setting parameter ICRAIN =** 4, **so that this output may be reviewed prior to the actual continuous SWMM simulation. Of course, in this case *file* NSCRAT(2) should be saved so that it can be retrieved and used later for a continuous SWMM simulation when ICRAIN is set equal to 2.**

**<u>Single Event SWMM</u>**

**NWS tapes are not used, nor is subroutine CTRAIN called for single event simulation. Precipitation is entered on cards as in the past. However, snowfall can be included, if desired, as a negative precipitation value at any time step.**

**SUBCATCHMENT SCIfEMATIZATION**

**<u>Land Surface - Snow Cover Combinations</u>**

**In order to have flexibility in treating different combinations of snow cover and ground surface types, four such combinations are provided, as described in Table II-2 and illustrated in Figure II-5. When snowmelt is not simulated, only the first three are used, as in the past. (Type 3, impervious area with no depression storage, is specified in Runoff by the parameter PCTZER, percent of impervious area with immediate runoff.) Snow cover is treated identically on types 1 and 3 since these surfaces are likely to be of a similar nature, e.g., streets, sidewalks, parking lots, etc. For continuous simulation, these surfaces are considered "normally bare" because of probable plowing, salting or other rapid snow removal, but are subject to snow cover also, as described subsequently. For single event simulation, these surfaces are always bare; all snow on' impervious areas is handled in type 4.**

**In Runoff, especially subroutine WSHED, the "types" are subscripts for the parameter WDEPTH, the water depth on each surface type. Since snow cover is the same for types 1 and 3, snow depths, WSNOW, are only triply subscripted.**

**For single event simulation, the fraction of snow covered pervious area is constant; for continuous simulation the fraction varies according to an areal depletion curve (as for type 4 impervious). The depletion curves are explained in a following subsection.**

> **384 11-12**
>
> **Apportionment of impervious area is different when simulating with and without snowmelt. For the latter situation, the area with zero depression storage (type 3) is taken as a percentage, PCTZER, of the total impervious area. For the former situation (with snowmelt), it is taken as a percentage, the same PCTZER, of the bare impervious area (single event simulation) or of the "normally bare" impervious area (continuous simulation). Thus, the type 3 area will vary according to whether snowmelt is simulated or not, as shown** in Figure 11-5. The effect on outflow is very minor. The fraction of imper­vious area with 100 percent snow cover (single event) or subject to an areal depletion curve (continuous) is an input parameter, SNN1, for each subcatch-ment.

> **Snow removal practices form a major difference between the snow hydrol­ogy of urban and rural areas. Much of the snow cover may be completely removed from heavily urbanized areas, or plowed into windrows or piles, with melt characteristics that differ markedly from those of undisturbed snow. Management practices in cities vary according to location, climate, topogra­phy and the storm itself; they are summarized in a study by APWA (1974). It is probably not possible to treat them all in a simulation model. However, in continuous SWMM, provision is made for approximate simulation of some practices.**

All snow in excess of this depth, say 0.1 - 0.2 in. water equivalent (2.5 - 5.1 mm), is redistributed to other areas according to five fractions, SFRAC, input for each subcatchment. These are described on Figure II-6. For instance, if snow is usually windrowed onto adjacent impervious or pervious areas, SFRAC(1) or SFRAC(2) may be used. If it is trucked to another subcatchment, (the last one input is used for this purpose), a fraction SFRAC(3) will so indicate, or SFRAC(4) if the snow is removed entirely from the simulated watershed. In the latter case, such removals are tabulated and included in the final continuity check. Finally, excess snow may be immediately "melted", (i.e., treated as rainfall), using SFRAC(5). The transfers are area weighted, of course, and the five fractions should sum to 1.0. A depth of snow WEPLOW remains on the normally bare area and is subject to melting as on the other areas. See Table II-3 for guide­lines as to typical levels of service for snow and ice control (Richardson et al., 1974).

Limitations for single event SWHN remain at 200 subcatchments and 200 gutter/pipes plus inlets.

<u>Snowpack Heat Budget</u> --

Heat may be added or removed from a snowpack by the following processes:

> 1\. Absorbed solar radiation (addition).
>
> Nat langwave radiation exchange with the surrounding environment (addition or removal).

3.  Convective transfer of sensible heat from air (addition or removal).

4.  Release of latent heat of vaporization by condensate (addition) or, the opposite, its removal by sublimation (removing the latent heat of vaporization plus the latent heat of fusion).

5.  Advection of heat by rain (addition) plus addition of the heat of fusion if the rain freezes.

6.  Conduction of heat from underlying ground (removal or addition).

The terms nay be summed, with appropriate signs, and equated to the change of heat stored in the snowpack to form a conservation of heat equa­tion. Refer to Appendix III for further detail. All of the processes listed above vary in relative importance with topography, season, climate, local meteorological conditions, etc., but items 1-4 are the most important. Item 5 is of less importance on a seasonal basis, and item 6 is often neglected.

A snowpack is termed "ripe" when any additional heat will produce liquid runoff. Rainfall (item 5) will rapidly ripen a snowpack by release of its latent heat of fusion as it freezes in subfreezing snow, followed by quickly filling the free water holding capacity of the snow.

<u>Melt Prediction Techniques</u> --

Prediction of melt follows from prediction of the heat storage of the snow pack. "Energy budget" techniques are the most exact formulation since they evaluate each of the heat budget terms individually, requiring as mete­orologic input **quantities such as solar radiation, air temperature, dew** point or relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Assumptions must be made about the density, surface roughness and heat and water storage (mass balance) of the snow pack as well as on related topographical and vegetative parameters. Further complications arise in dealing with heat conduction and roughness of the underlying ground and whether or not it is permeable.

Several models treat individually some or all of these effects. One of the more recent was developed for the NWS river forecast system by Anderson (1976). Interestingly, under many conditions, he found that results obtained using his energy balance model were not significantly better than those ob­tained using simpler (e.g., degree-day or temperature-index) techniques in **his** earlier model (1973). The more open and variable the conditions, the

> 390 **11-18**
>
> **better** is the energy balance technique. Closest agreement between his two models was for heavily forested watersheds.
>
> Minimal data ***needed*** to apply an energy balance model are a good esti­mate of incoming solar radiation, plus measurements of air temperature, vapor pressure (or dew point or relative humidity) and wind speed. All of these data, except possibly solar radiation, are available at at least one location (e.g., the airport) for almost all reasonably sized cities. Even solar radi­ation measurements are taken at several locations in most states. Predictive techniques are also available, for solar radiation and other parameters, based on available measurements (TVA, 1972, Franz, 1974).
>
> <u>Choice of Predictive Method</u> --
>
> Two major reasons suggest that simpler, e.g., temperature-index, tech­niques should be used for simulation of snowmelt and accumulation in urban areas. First, even though required meteorologic data for energy balance models are likely to be available, there is a large local variation in the magnitude of these parameters due to the urbanization itself. For example, radiation melt will be influenced heavily by shading of buildings and
>
> reduced albedo caused by urban pollutants. In view of the many unknown pro­perties of the snowpack itself in urban areas, it may be overly ambitious to attempt to predict melt at all! But at the least, simpler techniques are probably all that are warranted. They have the added advantage of consider­ably reducing the already extensive input data to a model such as SWMM.
>
> Second, the objective of the modeling should be examined. Although it may contribute, snowmelt seldom causes flooding or hydrologic extremes in an urban area itself. Hence, exact prediction of flow magnitudes does not as­sume nearly the importance it has in the models of, say, the NWS, in which river flood forecasting is of paramount importance. For continuous simula­tion and planning purposes in urban areas, exact quantity (or quality) pre­diction is not the objective in any event; rather, these efforts produce a statistical evaluation of a complex system and help identify critical time periods for more detailed analysis.
>
> For these and other reasons, simple snowmelt prediction techniques have been incorporated into SWMM. In their literature review preparatory to sim­ilar earlier work, Proctor and Redfern and James F. MacLaren (1976a, 1976b) felt that Anderson's NWS (1973) temperature-index method was most appropriate for SWMM. It is also well documented and tested, and has been incorporated into the SWMM version described herein. As described subsequently, the snow-melt modeling follows Anderson's work in several areas, not just in the melt equations. The energy budget technique is illustrated in this report, how­ever, in Appendix III, in order to show how it reduces to a temperature-index equation under certain assumptions. It may be noted that the STORM model (Hydrologic Engineering Center, 1977, Roesner et al., 1974) also uses the temperature-index method for snowmelt prediction, in a considerably less complex manner than is now programmed in SWMM.

**<u>SWMM Melt Equations</u>**

**Anderson's NWS model (1973) treats two different melt situations: with and without rainfall. When there is rainfall (greater than 0.1 in./6 hr or 2.5 mm/6 hr in the NWS model, greater than 0.02 in./hr or 0.51 mm/hr in SWMM), accurate assumptions may be made about several energy budget terms. These are: zero solar radiation, incoming longwave radiation equals blackbody r<sup>."4."-"</sup>n at the ambient air temperature, the snow surface temperature is 32°F (0°C), and the dew point and rain water temperatures equal the ambient air temperature. Anderson combines the appropriate terms for each heat budget component into one equation for the melt rate. As used in subroutine MELT in SWMM, it is**

**The psychometric constant, y, is calculated as**

For instance, these parameters may be used to account for street salting which lowers the base melt temperature. If desired, rooftops could be simulated as a separate subcatchment using a lower value of TBASE to reflect heat transfer vertically through the roof. Values of TBASE will probably range between 25 and 32 °F (-4 and 0°C). Unfortunately, few urban area data exist to define adequately appropriate modified values for TBASE and DHM, and they may be considered calibration parameters.**

In urban areas, values may tend toward the higher part of the range due to compression of the pack by vehicles, pedestrians, windrows, etc. Again, there appear to be few data available to produce accurate estimates. However, Bengston (1981) and Westerstrom (1981) do describe preliminary results of urban snowmelt studies in Sweden, including degree-day coefficients which range from 3 to 8 mm/°C-day (0.007 - 0.17 in./°F-day).**

> **It is important to realize that a degree-day equation may be derived from the complete energy budget equation if parameters other than air tem­perature are held constant. The equation is simply linearized about a desired air temperature range, and numerical values for DHM and TBASE com­puted. The values are accurate for the assumed values of other parameters, but may not appear to make sense physically, e.g., it is not difficult to use parameters that produce negative values of TBASE. An example of this procedure is given in Appendix III. It also serves to illustrate the energy budget computation method.**

> **During subfreezing weather, the snow pack does not melt, and heat ex­change with the atmosphere can either warm or cool the pack. The difference between the heat content of the subfreezing pack and the (higher) base melt temperature is taken as positive and termed the "cold content" of the pack. No melt will occur until this quantity, COLDC in SWMM, is reduced to zero. It is maintained in inches (or feet) of water equivalent. That is, a cold content of 0.1 in. (2.5 mm) is equivalent to the heat required to melt 0.1 in. (2.5 mm) of snow. Following Anderson (1973), the heat exchange altering the cold content is proportional to the difference between the air tempera­ture, TA, and an antecedent temperature index, ATI, indicative of the temper­ature of the surface layer of the snow pack. The revised value of ATI at time step 2 is calculated as**

> **The weighting factor, TIPM, is an indication of the thickness of the "surface" layer of snow. Values of TIPM less than 0.1 give significant weight to temperatures over the past week or more and would thus indicate a deeper layer than TIPM values greater than, say, 0.5 which would essentially only give weight to temperatures during the past day. In other words, the pack will both warm and cool more slowly with low values of TIPM. Anderson states that TIPM = 0.5 has given reasonable results in natural watersheds,**
>
> **394 11-22**

**although there is some evidence that a lower value may be more appropriate. No calibration has been attempted on urban watersheds.**

**Following computation of the antecedent temperature index, the cold content is changed by an amount**

> **At = time step, sec.**

**Note that the cold content is increased, (ACOLDC is positive) when the air temperature is less (colder) than the antecedent temperature index. Since heat transfer during non-melt periods is less than during melt periods, Anderson uses a "negative melt coefficient" in the heat exchange computation. SWMM computes this simply as a fraction, RNM, of the melt coefficient, DHM. Hence, the negative melt coefficient, i.e., the product RHM • DHM, also varies seasonally. A typical value of RNM is 0.6.**

**When heat is added to a snow pack with zero cold content, liquid melt is produced, but runoff does not occur, until the "free water holding capa­city" of the snow pack is filled. This is discussed subsequently. For single event SWMM no cold content calculations are performed; values of COLDC are assumed to equal zero throughout the simulation. The value of COLDC is in units of feet of water equivalent over the area in question. The cold content "volume", equivalent to calories or BTU's is obtained by multiplying by the area. Finally, an adjustment is made to equation II-16 depending on the areal extent of snow cover. This is discussed below.**

**<u>Areal Extent of Snow Cover  
Introduction</u> --**

**The snow pack on a catchment rarely melts uniformly over the total area. Rather, due to shading, drifting, topography, etc., certain portions of the catchment will become bare before others, and only a fraction, ASC, will be snow covered. This fraction must be known in order to compute the snow covered area available for heat exchange and melt, and to know how much rain falls on bare ground. Because of year to year similarities in topography, vegetation, drift patterns, etc., the fraction, ASC, is primarily only a function of the amount of snow on the catchment at a given time; this func­tion, called an "areal depletion curve", is discussed below. These functions are used only for continuous SWMM to describe the seasonal growth and reces­sion of the snow pack. For single event simulation, fractions of snow covered area are fixed for the pervious and impervious areas of each subcatchment.**

**396 11-24**

> **<u>Areal Depletion Curves</u> --**
>
> **The functional dependence of the areal depletion curve, ADC, has just been described. As used in most snowmelt models, it is assumed that there is a depth, SI, above which there will always *be* 100 percent cover. In some models, the value of SI is adjusted during the simulation; in SWMM it remains constant. The amount of snow present at any time is indicated by the param­eter WGNOW, which** is **Cue depth (water equivalent) over each of the three possible snow covered areas of each subcatchment, (see Figure II-5). This depth is nondimensionalized by SI for use in calculating ASC. Thus, an areal depletion curve is a plot of WSNOW/SI versus ASC; a typical ADC for a natural catchment is shown in Figure II-8. For values of the ratio AWESI = WSNOW/SI greater than 1.0, ASC = 1.0, that is, the area is 100 percent snow covered.**

drifting might provide such a mechanism; in urban areas, plowing and wind­rowing could cause a similar effect. A complex curve could be generated to represent specific snow removal practices in a city. However, the program utilizes only one ADC curve for all impervious areas (e.g., area A4 of Figure II-5 for all subcatchments) and only one ADC curve for all pervious areas (e.g., area A2 of Figure II-5 for all subcatchments). This limitation should not hinder an adequate simulation since the effects of variations in individ­ual locations are averaged out in the city-wide scope of most continuous simulations.

The two ADC curves for pervious and impervious areas are input by the user, as are values of SI for each subcatchment. The program does not require the ADC curves to pass through the origin, AWESI=ASC=0; they may intersect the abscissa at a value of ASC \> 0 in order to maintain some snow covered area up until the instant that all snow disappears (see Figure II-8). However, the curves may not intersect the ordinate, AWESI \> 0 when ASC = O.

The preceding paragraphs have centered on the situation where a depth of snow greater than or equal to SI has fallen and is melting. (The ADC curves are not employed until WSNOW becomes less than SI.) The situation when there is new snow needs to be discussed, starting from both zero or non-zero initial cover. The SWMM procedure again follows Anderson's NWS method (1973).

When there is new snow and WSNOW is already greater than or equal to SI, then ASC remains unchanged at 1.0. However, when there is new snow on bare or partially bare ground, it is assumed that the total area is 100 per­cent covered for a period of time, and a "temporary" ADC is established as shown in Figure II-8. This temporary curve returns to the same point on the ADC as the snow melts. Let the depth of new snow be SNO, measured in equi­valent feet of water. Then the value of AWESI will be changed from an ini­tial value of AWE to a *new* value of SNEW by

> SNEW = AWE + SNO/SI (II-20)

It is assumed that the areal snow cover remains at 100 percent until 25 per­cent of the new snow melts. This defines the value of SBWS of Figure II-8 as

> SBWS = AWE + 0.75 • ANO/SI (II-21)

Anderson (1973) reports low sensitivity of model results to the arbitrary 25 percent assumption. When melt produces a value of AWESI between SBWS and AWE, linear interpolation of the temporary curve is used to find ASC until. the actual ADC curve is again reached. When new snow has fallen, the pro­gram thus maintains values of AWE, SBA and SBWS.

The interactive nature of melt and fraction of snow cover is not accounted for <u>during</u> each time step. It is sufficient to use the value of ASC at the beginning of each time step, especially with the short one-hour time step used for the simulation.

> <u>Use of Value of</u> ASC --
>
> The fraction of area that is snow covered, ASC, is *used* to adjust 1) the volume of melt that occurs, and 2) the "volume" of cold content change, since it is assumed that heat transfer occurs only over the snow covered area. The melt rate is computed from either equation II-8 or equation II-13. The snow depth is then reduced from its value at time step 1 to time step 2

>
> <u>Liquid Water Routing in Snow Pack</u>
>
> Production of melt does not necessarily mean that there will be liquid runoff at a given time step since a snow pack, acting as a porous medium with a "porosity", has a certain "free water holding capacity" at a given instant in time. Following PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b), this capacity is taken as a constant fraction, FWFRAC, of the variable snow depth, WSNOW, at each time step. This volume (depth) must be filled before runoff from the snow pack occurs. The program maintains the depth of free water, FW, ft of water, for use in these computations. When FW = FWFRAC • WSNOW, the snow pack is fully ripe. The procedure is sketched in Figure II-10.
>
> The inclusion of the free water holding capacity via this simple reser­voir-type routing delays and somewhat attenuates the appearance of liquid runoff. The value of FWFRAC will normally be less than 0.10 and usually between 0.02 - 0.05 for deep snow packs (WSNOW \> 10 in. or 254 mm water equivalent). However, Anderson (1973) reports that a value of 0.25 is not unreasonable for shallow snow packs that may form a slush layer. When rain­fall occurs, it is added to the melt rate entering storage as free water. No free water **is** released when melt does not occur, but remains in storage, available for release when the pack is again ripe. This re-frozen free water is not included in subsequent cold content or melt computations.
>
> <u>Net Runoff</u>
>
> Melt from snow covered areas and rainfall on bare surfaces are area weighted and combined to produce net runoff onto the surface as follows,
>
> RI = ASC • SMELT + (1.0-ASC) • RINE (II-24)
>
> 401 11-29

> ASC = fraction of area that is snow covered,

SMELT = melt rate, including effect of attenuation due to free water

>
> RINE = rainfall intensity, ft/sec.
>
> Thus, the net runoff acts just as rainfall would act alone in subsequent overland flow aad ia'<sup>414-</sup>-ation calculations.
>
> If immediate melt is produced through the use of the snow redistribu­tion fraction S7RAC(5), discussed earlier (see Figure II-6), it is added to equation II-24. Furthermore, all melt calculations are ended when the depth of snow water equivalent becomes less than 0.001 in. (0.025 mm), and remain­ing snow and free water are converted to immediate melt and added to equa­tion II-24.
>
> <u>Effect of Snow on Infiltration and Surface Parameters</u>
>
> A snow pack tends to insulate the surface beneath it. If ground has frozen prior to snowfall, it will tend to remain so, even as the snow begins to melt. Conversely, unfrozen ground is generally not frozen by subsequent snowfall. The infiltration characteristics of frozen versus unfrozen ground are not well understood and depend upon the moisture content at the time of freezing. For these and other reasons, SWMM assumes that snow has no effect on infiltration or other parameters, such as surface roughness or detention storage (although the latter is altered in a sense through the use of the free water holding capacity of the snow). In addition, all heat transfer calculations cease when the water becomes "net runoff". Thus, water in tem­porary surface storage during the overland flow routing will not refreeze as the temperature drops and is also subject to evaporation beneath the snow pack.

> QUALITY INTERACTIONS  
> <u>Pollutant Accumulation  
> Snowmelt Quality</u> --
>
> A detailed review of literature related to snowmelt quality is given by PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b). Among the various contaminants found in deposited snow and melt water, chlorides and lead appear to be the most serious and potentially hazardous. Chloride concentrations in runoff along major high­ways can be higher than 20,000 mg/1, with typical values of from 1,000 to 10,000 mg/l. Several other studies also document chloride contamination and discuss street salting practices (Field et al., 1973, Richardson et al., 1974, Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 1974). Lead concentrations in snow windrows have been as high as 100 mg/1 with typical values of from 1 to 10 mg/l. However, most deposited lead results from automobile combustion and is insoluble. Hence, melt runoff concentrations are lower than snow pack values and are mostly associated with suspended solids.

**<u>Pollutant Loadings</u> --**

**Mechanisms and modeling alternatives for pollutant buildup and washoff are described extensively in Section 4 (Runoff Block). Any parameter**

**related to snowmelt may be generated using linear or non-linear buildup, or else a rating curve (load proportional to flow). Specifically, street salt­ing chemicals may be simulated, such as sodium chloride or calcium chloride.**

**<u>Adjustments for Presence of Snow</u> --**

**As a user option, regeneration of any quality constituent may be per­formed only when snow is present. This option is indicated by parameter LINKUP. Thus, if chlorides are simulated, for example, they will not be re­generated from bare ground, during the summer months for instance. However, regeneration when it does occur is a function only if the snow is present, not the actual <u>amount</u> (depth).**

**<u>Possible Loading Rates</u> --**

**Pollutant loading rates are best determined from local data. The lite-ature review of PR-JFM (1976a, 1976b) may also be consulted for tables that may be used to estimate loading rate parameters for snow-associated pollu­tants. Other references will also be useful (e.g., Field et al., 1973, Richardson et a\].., 1974, Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 1974).**

**Table II-4 (Richardson et al, 1974) lists <u>recommended</u> deicing chemical application rates for roadways. In general, PR-JFM show that <u>observed</u> load­ing rates are functions of population density with suburban rates lower than arterial highway rates, as indicated in Table II-5. This is also true for other pollutants.**

**<u>Street Sweeping</u>**

**Simulation of street sweeping in SWMM is performed as in the past, except: for slight modifications as described in Section 4. The effect of snow is included in two minor ways. First, beginning and ending dates, parameters KLNBGN and KLNEND respectively, may be input for continuous SWMM to indicate**

> **405 11-33**
>
> **the interval during the year subject to street sweeping. If sweeping normally is not done between, say, December 1 and March 1, because of high snow volumes, this may be so indicated.**
>
> **Second, the presence of snow can alter the street sweeping interval. These intervals are specified for each of the five land uses. Each sub-catchment is swept when the number of <u>dry</u> time steps for that subcatchment exceeds the interval for the given land use. A dry time step, in subroutine QSHED, is one in which there is no precipitation and no water or snow on areas Al and A3 (Figure II-S). Thus, subcatchments will not be swept until there is no snow or water on "normally bare" impervious areas.**
>
> **<u>Other Considerations</u>**
>
> **The snow itself is assumed to be "pure" and contain no pollutants.**
>
> **Thus, the redistribution or transfers of snow described earlier (Figure II-6) will not remove accumulated pollutants. This is partially justified on the basis of the assumption that such transfers would occur soon after fresh snow has fallen. They occur during the same time step in the model.**
>
> **Although not well tested, it is assumed that the principal effect of inclusion of snowmelt upon runoff quality predictions of continuous SWMM will be to shift the season and magnitude of pollutant washoff. There will tend to be fewer periods of washoff during the winter. As snowmelt, equivalent melt rates are likely to be less than the usual magnitude of rainfall inten­sities experienced. Hence, concentrations may tend to be more uniform during the melt washoff events.**
>
> **DATA REQUIREMENTS  
> <u>New Parameters </u>**
>
> **The revised Runoff Block input data formats should be examined for the new snowmelt variables. For single event simulation these include watershed elevation, free water holding capacities, air temperatures and wind speeds, and for each subcatchment, snow covered fractions, initial snow and free water, melt coefficients and base temperatures. Continuous simulation requires the same data as above, except that air temperatures are computed using other input parameters. In addition, it requires the snow gage cor­rection factor, negative heat exchange parameter, areal depletion curves, and, for each subcatchment, the redistribution parameters. Of course, for continuous simulation, the required parameters can be kept to a minimum by keeping the number of subcatchments used to a minimum (e.g., one). Also required are pollutant loading data that may or may not be related to snow.**
>
> **<u>Sensitivity</u>**
>
> **The melt routines have not been sufficiently tested to date to quantify the sensitivity of results to various input parameters. It is expected that melt volumes will be most related to the precipitation record, of course, and to the gage correction factor, which influences the amount of snow that**
>
> **406 II-34**
>
> **falls. Melt rates will be influenced by the melt coefficients and base tem­peratures, and, to some degree, by the areal depletion curves which simulate the relative "piling" or "stacking" of the snow.**

**APPENDIX III**

**REDUCTION OF ENERGY BALANCE EQUATION TO DEGREE-DAY EQUATION**

> **PURPOSE**
>
> **This appendix presents equations that can be used for each term in the energy balance equation discussed in Appendix II. The equation is then lin­earized and typical numerical values are used to reduce it to a degree-day or temperature-index type equation. The energy budget method will thus *be* better understood, and a physical basis for the simple prediction equations will be seen. Notation and equations used will follow Eagleson (1970), al­though an identical development could he based nn several other references.**

Albedos of dirty urban snow surfaces are not documented, but probably lower than 0.4. Net shortwave radiation, H<sub>rs</sub>, is incoming minus reflected.

**CONDENSATION HEAT TRANSFER, H<sub>e</sub>**

**Since both this and convective heat transfer are diffusive type pro­cesses, the same introductory remarks hold as for the latter. A common equation is (Eagleson, 1970)**

**The factor of 8.5 in equation III-10 accounts for the fact that when the snow pack is ripe, the latent heat of condensation will supply the latent heat of fusion to melt the snow. Because of the ratio of these latent heats, 600/80 = 7.5, each inch of condensate will cause 7.5 + 1 = 8.5 inches of "melt".**

**The low value of T<sub>u</sub> of about 9°F implies sufficient energy input (via solar radiation and condensation) to cause melt even at low temperatures. This is not really true, however, since the melt equation was linearized about a temperature of 35°F and should only *be* used in that range. The exercise serves to indicate the range of values that may be found when sub­stituting actual meteorological data iato the equations. Although seem­ingly wrong values may result, e.g., base melt temperatures less than zero, the equation with such values is still valid for the input parameters used and over the range of the linearization.**

The earlier versions were more limited in use and scope. This version is much more flexible in terms of the control units available, pollutant routing and cost estimating. However, the user is advised that increased flexibility implies increased user input and knowledge of the processes to be modeled. In other words, the model does not provide several dozen specialized designs, but provides the tools necessary to simu­late the desired processes. Naturally, flexibility precludes ultrasophisti-cation.

> Several precautions should be noted before setting up the S/T Block.

1.  Local waste characterization data are essential to appraise realisti­cally the performance of treatment units.

2.  Lab or pilot plant performance data should be used whenever possible to derive performance functions.

3.  Dry-weather treatment performance functions should be applied cautious­ly to wet-weather units.

> Past versions of the Storage/Treatment Block simulated various proces­ses on the basis of limited empirical data and operating experience. Often the data were localized and/or specialized. Thus, they were of questionable applicability to a wide variety of situations. Additionally, the model did not account for the physical characteristics of the incoming waste stream or the handling of residuals (sludges).

To improve the storage/treatment modeling capabilities of SWMM the fol­lowing considerations were instrumental in creating a new model.

1.  There should be a high degree of flexibility in the simulation of in­dividual units and the interaction among units.

2.  In addition to simulating the mass of pollutants, it is important to account for the physical characteristics (i.e., particle size and spe--"" gravity distribution) of each pollutant.

3.  Residual (sludge) handling is an important part of any wastewater treatment scheme and should be simulated.

4.  All costing routines should be as flexible as the performance algorithms.

5.  The model should be capable of modeling wet- and dry-weather facilities.

<u>Overview</u>

The present Storage/Treatment Block is approximately 2000 Fortran state­ments in length and consists of eight subroutines. The routing of flow and nollutants thrnugh the entire block is controlled by subroutine STRT which is called from the Executive Block. STRT also provides the main driving loop for the model and generally acts as the central coordinating subroutine. Subroutine STRDAT is called in STRT and is responsible for reading the input data provided by the user. Subroutine CONTRL is called each time-step from the main driving loop in STRT. CONTRL directs flow and pollutants from one unit to another as prescribed by the desired scheme and coordinates the majority of the printed output. Subroutine UNIT is called from CONTRL for each unit modeled and is the heart of the Storage/Treatment Block. It con­tains the necessary flexibility and capability to model most storage/treat-ment processes (units). Subroutine EQUATE is used by UNIT to provide several forms of pollutant removal equations. Subroutine INTERP is employed by UNIT for linear interpolation. Subroutine PLUGS is used by UNIT to model perfect plug flow through a detention unit. Subroutine STCOST is called from STRT to determine capital and operation and maintenance costs.

The model has become user-intensive rather than program-intensive. The user is responsible for providing the program with the desired storage/treat-ment scheme and operating characteristics of each unit (along with other information). However, input guidelines are provided in the User's Manual for several types of units. Again, the strength of this approach is to maximize flexibility and applicability to local conditions and design criteria.

SIMULATION TECHNIQUES  
<u>Introduction</u>

Flow and pollutants are routed through one or more storage/treatment units by several techniques. The flows into, through and out of a unit are shown in Figure IV-1. The units may be arranged in any fashion, restricted only by the requirements that inflow to the plant enters at only one unit

and that the products (treated outflow, residuals, and bypass flow) from each unit not be directed to more than three units. Treatment and sludge handling units are modeled by the same subroutine (UNIT). Additionally, both wet-and dry-weather facilities may be simulated by the proper selection of unit arrangement and characteristics. Units may ***be*** modeled as having a detention capability or instantaneous throughflow. Pollutants or sludges may be repre­sented as mass only or further characterized by a particle size or settling velocity distribution. **A** unit may remove pollutants (or concentrate sludges) as a function of particle size and specific gravity, detention time, incoming concentration, the removal rate of another pollutant, or a constant percentage. The S/T Block can receive the flow and any three pollutants from any one outlet in any other block of SWMM. Also, flows and pollutants may be provided by the user and fed directly to the S/T Block. If both sources are present they are combined and treated as one input. For example, the user may enter directly dry-weather flows and enter wet-weather flows from the Runoff Block. All flows and pollutant concentrations reported by the S/T Block are average values over each time step. This is necessary for some of the algorithms in the S/T Block (in particular, the plug flow routines); it does not signifi­cantly affect the results.

The following sections describe the techniques available for flow and pollutant routing which allow the user to model several types of storage/ treatment units.

<u>Flow Routing</u>

<u>Detention vs. Instantaneous Throughflow</u>

--

A unit may be modeled to handle flow in one of two ways; as a detention unit (reservoir) or a unit instantaneously passing all flow. The idea of a detention unit is not limited to storage basins and sedimentation tanks but also includes such processes as dissolved air flotation, activated sludge, and chlorination. Processes that may be modeled as having instantaneous throughflow include microscreens, fine screens and other forms of screening.

<u>Detention Units</u> --

The rate of change of storage in a detention unit or reservoir is found by writing a mass balance equation for the system shown in Figure IV-2.

This is accomplished by averaging the surface area between adjacent values of depth, multiplying by the difference in depth, and adding the incremental volume to the accumu­lated total. The depth-area data pairs are also used to estimate the volume lost from the reservoir due to evaporation.

The data in Table IV-1 give 0<sub>2</sub> and 11,, as functions of depth. In this case, discharge or outflow occurs only if the reservoir depth exceeds 8.0 ft. The model uses these data to calculate the values of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At (column 7) and 0.50<sub>1</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub> (column 8) for each depth (defined in the model as 02DT2 and SATERM, respectively). Thus, the relationship required by equation IV-7 is indirectly generated. During the simulation, the value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub> is calculated by equation IV-6 and the corresponding value of 0.50<sub>1</sub>At found by linear interpolation through the previously generated set of 020T2 - SATERM values. The values of 0<sub>2</sub> and V are subsequently calculated. This proce­dure is repeated each time step<sup>2</sup>with the value of 0<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> becoming the values of 0<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> for use in equation IV-6 during the next time step. In a normal simulation the outflow<sub>,</sub> 0<sub>2,</sub> represents treated outflow, residual

> The computational procedure is summarized as follows:

1.  Known values of I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, 0<sub>1</sub>, it, and V<sub>1</sub> are substituted into the right hand side of equation IV-6. The result is the first value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub>.

2.  Knowing (0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2</sub>) the value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At is obtained by interpola­ting between adjacent values of 02DT2 and SATERM.

3.  The values of V<sub>2</sub> and 0<sub>2</sub> are determined and become the values of V<sub>1</sub> and 0<sub>1,</sub> respectively, in the next time step.

4.  Add 0.5(I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>) At to the new value of V<sub>1</sub> - 0.50<sub>1</sub>At to get the new value of 0.50<sub>2</sub>At + V<sub>2.</sub>

5.  Continue this process until all inflows have been routed.

> To summarize the input alternatives, the earlier version of the storage model permitted the user to read in depth-area data and an outflow condition of a weir, orifice, or pumping. It could not handle the case of a natural reservoir with an irregular stage-discharge relationship.

> Removed pollutant quantities are not allowed to accumulate in a completely-mixed detention unit. Strictly, pollutants cannot settle under such conditions. Therefore, the residual stream is effectively another route for treated outflow. All pollutant removal is assumed to occur by non-physical means (e.g., biological decomposition). Several processes such as flocculation and rapid-mix chlorination are essentially completely-mixed detention units.

Transfer of pollutants between plugs is not permitted. The outflow for any time step is comprised of the oldest plugs, and/or fractions thereof, present is the unit. This is accomplished by satisfying continuity for the present outflow volume (which was calculated earlier):

> As in a completely-mixed detention unit, detention time is the most impor­tant indicator of pollutant removal ability. Removal equations are speci­fied by the user (see later discussion) and, in this case, should be written as a function of detention time (along with other possible parameters). The detention time for each plug j is calculated as
>
> (t<sub>d</sub>)<sub>j</sub> = (KKDT - j)At (IV-13)

> where KKDT = present time step number. The detention time is calculated in the same manner during dry- and wet-weather periods because the plugs always maintain their identity.
>
> Removed pollutant quantities accumulate in a plug-flow unit until they are drawn off by residual flow. The accumulated pollutants do not affect the amount of available storage and are assumed to be conservative (i.e., no decay). When residual flow occurs the entire unit contents (including the removed pollutant quantities) are mixed and drawn off until the unit is empty or wet weather continues. If wet weather (i.e., inflow) occurs before the unit is empty, the contents are placed into one plug for further routing.
>
> <u>Instantaneous Throughflow</u>

> Pollutants are routed instantaneously through units modeled as having no detention capability. In other words, the pollutants arriving during a time step leave the same time step less the removed portion. The amount of removed pollutants is determined by user-supplied removal equations (see later discussion). The removed pollutants are routed with the residuals stream.

> **<u>Pollutant Characterization</u>**
>
> **Pollutants are characterized by their magnitude (i.e., mass flow and concentration) and, if the user desires, by particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distributions. Describing pollutants by their particle size distribution is especially appropriate where small or large particles dominate or where several storage/treatment units are operated in series. For example, if the influent is primarily sand and grit, then a sedimentation unit would be very effective; if clay and silt predominate, sedimentation may be of little use. Also, if several units are operated in series, the first units will remove a certain range of particle sizes thus affecting the performance of downstream units. Therefore, the need for describing pollu­tants in more detail is obvious for modeling purposes. The pollutant removal mechanism peculiar to each characterization is discussed below.**

This selection is left to the user but there are some restrictions (depending on the unit type). A single flexible equation is provided by the program to construct the desired removal equa­tion:**

> <u>Characterized by Particle Size Specific Gravity or Settling Velocity Distribution</u> --
>
> <u>Particle Sizes and Specific Gravities</u> -- If a pollutant is characterized by its particle size/specific gravity or settling velocity distribution, then it is removed from the waste stream by particle settling or obstruction. Many storage/treatment processes use these physical methods to treat waste­water; sedimentation and screening are among the most obvious examples.
>
> In this mode, the pollutant is apportioned over several (up to 10) par­ticle size/specific gravity ranges (e.g., ten percent of the BOD is found in the range from 10 to 50 microns) or settling velocities. Each of the ranges is preset by the user and assigaed an upper and lower bound on the particle diameter and a value for specific gravity. If a size/specific gravity distribution is specified the model estimates the average settling velocity for each range. Alternatively, the user may specify a set of set­tling velocity ranges. The user also specifies the apportionment of the pollutant over the various ranges as it enters the first unit. This distri­bution is modified as it passes through the storage/treatment plant. Un­fortunately, the distribution entered at the first unit must remain constant over time since the other blocks of SWMM do not provide a time-varying par­ticle size or settling velocity distribution.
>
> Each unit removes all or some portion of the particles in each range or velocity; the associated removal of the pollutant is easily determined. For example, if a sedimentation unit removes 50 percent of the particles in the 50 to 100 micron range and ten percent of the pollutant in question is found in this range, then five percent of the total pollutant load is re­moved. The total removal is determined by summing the effects of the sev­eral ranges or settling velocities passing through this unit. Once certain particles are removed, the distribution of particle sizes or settling ve­locities for the outflow can be determined and passed on to the next unit or receiving water. The removed particles constitute the size or settling velocity distribution for the sludge volume. The next several paragraphs describe the two mechanisms available to the user for pollutant removal when a pollutant is characterized by particle size or settling velocity.
>
> <u>Particle Settling</u> -- There are several forms of settling: unhindered set­tling by discrete particles, settling by flocculating particles, and hind­ered settling by closely spaced particles (Fair et al., 1968). For sim­plicity, the unhindered settling of discrete particles will be the removal mechanism simulated in this model. This procedure is <u>only</u> applicable to detention basins modeled as plug-flow reactors.

**Discrete particles settling in a quiescent fluid accelerate to the point where the drag force exerted by the suspending fluid reaches equilib­rium with the gravitational force exerted on the particle (Fair et al., 1968).

If a value computed from equation IV-31 is less than 0.01 it is set equal to 0.01 and similarly for the quiescent boundary.

To summarize, the particle settling computations proceed as follows.

1.  For each size and specific gravity range a settling velocity is com­puted using equations IV-19 to IV-24 or a distribution of settling velocities is provided by the user. If a settling velocity distri­bution is used the end points of each range are averaged to estimate the representative velocity. Then for each velocity (in each plug leaving the unit) all steps below are performed.

2.  The turbulence factor, a, is computed from equation IV-31.

3.  E<sub>Q</sub> is computed using equation IV-25.

4.  E<sub>T</sub> is computed using equation IV-32 or IV-33.

5.  Finally, the removal efficiency for the particular particle

> settling velocity is computed from equation IV-34.
>
> In a normal simulation, several plugs leave the detention unit in any given time step. The effluent is all, or part of a number of plugs depending on the required outflow as determined by the storage routing techniques dis­cussed earlier. Thus, the effluent particle size or settling velocity dis­tribution is a composite of several plugs. This composite distribution is
>
> 436 IV-20
>
> **determined by taking a weighted average (by pollutant weight in each plug) over the effluent plugs. This distribution is then routed downstream for release or further treatment. The particles that were removed from each plug are also composited and are used to characterize the sludge volume.**
>
> **<u>Particle Obstruction</u> -- The second removal mechanism used when a pollutant** is **characterized by a particle size or settling velocity distribution is obstruction. The most obvious example of a storage/treatment process using this mechanism is screening. This mechanism is assumed by the model whenever a non-detention unit is encountered (and a pollutant is characterized by a size or settling velocity distribution). The user simply specifies a "criti­cal" size or settling velocity and any particles with a greater size or settling velocity are removed (and, in turn, so are the associated pollu­tants). The program operation is simple but the interpretation of the "critical" size or settling velocity is more complex.**
>
> **The primary** intent of including this mechanism in the model is to simu­late screens. Pollutant removal by screens is a result of two actions: the straining of the screens, and the additional filtration provided by the mat produced by the initial screening (Maher, 1974). Screens vary widely in thQ size of the aperture and the manner in which the waste water flows through them. To simplify the analysis, the removal of particles may be assumed to be a function of screen size only; i.e., the filtration by the mat is ignored. In other words, a particular screen size will remove only those particles larger than that size. If a settling velocity distribution is employed, the user must specify a settling velocity. This is not entirely accurate, of course, but the result is a conservative removal estimate that may be accurate in cases where backwashing is at a relatively high rate. In fact, a study by Maher indicates that this simplifying assumption is reason­able (Maher, 1974). In this case, a microstrainer with a Mark "0" screen (aperture of 23 microns) was installed in a residential area of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The analysis of the backwash material for two storms (one in which a coagulant was used) revealed that, by particle <u>count,</u> 88 to 96 per­cent of the particles were indeed smaller than 23 microns. However, by <u>weight,</u> over 99 percent of the material was found in particles greater than 23 microns. Although Maher did not report the distribution in terms of weight, it was a simple matter to convert by assuming a specific gravity.
>
> During the simulation, a screen alters a particle size distribution for a particular time step without detention time. Again, only the particles larger than a specified or "critical" size are removed. The specified size may or may not correspond to the screen aperture, but such an assumption is probably valid given the preceeding discussion. If the specified size falls between the high and low ends of any range, the pollutants are removed by simple linear interpolation. For example, if 20 percent of the suspended solids are found in the range from 10 to 50 microns and the "critical" size is 20 microns, then 75 percent of the suspended solids in that range will be removed or 15 percent of the total suspended solids load. Of course, if the entire range is larger than the specified size, then all pollutants in that range are removed. If a pollutant is characterized by a settling velocity distribution (in lieu of a size distribution) the user specifies a "critical" settling velocity. The portion associated with velocities greater than or equal to the "critical" value is removed.
>
> 437 IV-21
>
> <u>Comment on Characterization by Particle Size Distribution</u> -- Pollutants characterized by a particle size or settling velocity distribution are restricted by the model to the two removal mechanisms discussed above. This limits the user somewhat if this characterization is chosen. The types of units that could be considered in this case would include sedimentation tanks and storage basins (operating as plug-flow reactors), bar racks, fine screens and microscreens. However, these units probably represent a large portion of the processes applied to the problem of combined sewer overflow and stormwater runoff. Thus, the limits of the applicability of the model using this mode are probably not too severe.

Recent EPA publications provide useful information for the proper selection of the coefficients required in equations IV-35 through IV-42 (EPA, 1976, Benjes, 1976).

> SUMMARY
>
> A new Storage/Treatment Block has been developed that is somewhat dif-ferent from its predecessor. The model requires greater user input and knowledge of the processes being modeled. Storage/Treatment units may be modeled as detention or non-detention units. Pollutants may be character­ized by their magnitude alone or by magnitude and their particle size/ specific gravity distribution. Any three of the pollutants available from other blocks may be routed through the S/T Block. A simple cost routine is also included.

APPENDIX V

OTHER RUNOFF BLOCK REVISIONS

> INFILTRATION  
> <u>Introduction</u>
>
> For pervious areas SWMM users now have the option of specifying one of two alternative infiltration models: The Horton model or the modified Green-Ampt model (Horton, 1940, Green and Ampt, 1911). Horton's model is empirical and is perhaps the best known of the infiltration equations. Many hydrologists have a "feel" for the best values of its three parameters dc-spite the fact that little published information is available. In its usual form it is applicable only to events for which the rainfall intensity always exceeds the infiltration capacity, although the modified form used in SWMM is intended to overcome this deficiency.
>
> On the other hand the Green-Ampt equation is a physically based model which can give a good description of the infiltration process. The Mein-Larson (1973) formulation of it is applicable also for the case of rainfall intensity being less than the infiltration capacity at the beginning of the storm. Work is currently underway to help users evaluate the parameter val­ues from available soil data. With results from these studies now being published, use of the Green-Ampt model for estimating infiltration should increase.
>
> <u>Evaporation</u>
>
> Evaporation is input for each month as parameter VAP in subroutine RHYDRO and used in equations in subroutine WSHED as parameter EVAP. It is considered as a loss "off the top". That is, evaporation is subtracted from rainfall depths and/or ponded water prior to calculating infiltration. Thus, subsequent use of the symbol i for "rainfall intensity" is really rainfall intensity less evaporation rate. Although evaporation and infiltration are summed to form one total loss (RLOSS in subroutine WSHED) for the subcatch-ment runoff calculations, separate totals are maintained for the overall continuity check.

<u>Regeneration of Infiltration Capacity</u> --

<u>Green-Ampt Equation</u>

<u>Infiltration During Rainfall Events</u>

The Green-Ampt equation (Green and Ampt, 1911) has received consider­able attention in recent years. The original equation, was for infiltration with excess water at the surface at all times. Mein and Larson (1973)

showed how it could be adapted to a steady rainfall input and proposed a way in which the capillary suction parameter could be determined. More recently Chu (1978) has shown the applicability of the equation to the unsteady rain­fall situation, using data for a field catchment.

The Mein-Larson formulation is a two-stage model. The first step pre­dicts the volume of water which will infiltrate before the surface becomes saturated. From this point onward, infiltration capacity is predicted by the Green-Ampt equation. Thus,

**Equation V-22 shows that the volume of rainfall required to saturate the surface depends on the current value of the rainfall intensity. Hence, at each time step for which i \> K , the value of F is calculated and com­pared with the volume of rainfall<sup>s</sup>already infiltrated for this event.

**When rainfall occurs at an intensity less than or equal to K, all rainfall infiltrates and is used only to update the initial moisture defi­cit, IMD. (The mechanism for this is discussed in the next subsection with reference to equation V-31.) The cumulative infiltration is not altered for this case of low rainfall intensity (relative to the saturated hydraulic conductivity, K<sub>s</sub>).**

**Equation V-23 shows that the infiltration capacity after surface satur­ation depends on the infiltrated volume, which in turn depends on the infil­tration rates in previous time steps.

In order to understand better the conversion of rainfall excess (rainfall and/or snowmelt less infiltration and/or evapor­ation) into runoff (overland flow), this subsection briefly describes the equations used for this purpose. It is intended to supplement the material presented in the original SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a).

> As discussed in Section 4, subcatchments are subdivided into three sub­areas that simulate impervious area, with and without depression (detention) storage, and pervious area (with depression storage). These are areas Al, A3 and A2 respectively on Figure V-4 and are denoted in subroutine WSHED by the subscript J, (J = 1, 2, 3, 4). When snowmelt is included, a fourth sub­area is added to account for the presence or absence of snow cover, (see Figure II-5 in Appendix II) but that case will not be considered further here. The depth of depression storage is an input parameter (WSTORE) for the im­pervious and pervious areas of each catchment.

**Equation V-37 is then solved for d<sub>2</sub> using a Newton-Raphson iteration; the Fortran coding is located near the end of subroutine WSHED.**

**Given d<sub>2,</sub> the instantaneous outflow at the end of a time step, WFLOW, is computed using equation V-34. Parameter WFLOW is used in runoff quality calculations and is the flow value that is input to inlets and gutter/pipes. The instantaneous outflow at a given time is also the flow value transfered to subsequent SWMM blocks.**

**Although the solution of equation V-37 is straightforward and simple (and in fact may be performed on programmable hand calculators), some pecu­liarities exist'in the way the parameters for individual subareas (Al, A2, A3 in Figure V-4) are specified. In particular, only two values of WCON are computed (equation V-36), one for the pervious and one for the total imper­vious subareas. Thus, WCON is the same for calculating depths on subareas Al and A3 and is computed from equation V-36 using the total impervious area, Al plus A3, in the denominator. However, the instantaneous flow is computed using the individual area of each subarea (e.g., Al or A3). The net effect for subareas Al and A3 is approximately to reduce the subcatchment width by the ratio Al/(Al + A3) or A3/(Al + A3) as implied in Figure V-4. Numerical tests of this scheme versus one that uses the individual areas (and propor­tional widths) in parameter WCON indicate only about a half percent differ­ence between the two methods. Hence, it should be satisfactory.**

**Prior to performing these calculations, a check is made to see if losses are greater than the rainfall depth plus ponded water. If so, the losses (evaporation plus infiltration) absorb all water and outflow is zero. Similarly, if losses alone would be sufficient to lower the depth below the depression storage, the new depth is computed on this basis only and the outflow is zero.**

**The computational scheme (equations V-37 and V-38) has proven quite stable. The only instance for which non-convergence problems arise (or an attempt to compute a negative depth) is when the subarea values are very small (e.g., a few square feet) coupled with a large time step (e.g., ten minutes). Should a non-convergence message be printed, the problem may usually be cured by increasing the appropriate area or decreasing the time step.**

The solution techniiue is performed in subroutine GUTTER and is entirely analo­gous to that just described for overland flow; no details will be given here. However, a few comments are in order. Two cross sectional shapes are avail­able for gutter/pipes: circular and trapezoidal, as shown in Figure V-6. Parameters representing depth (e.g., GDEPTH, Dl, DO) are actual depths, in feet, for trapezoidal gutters but not for circular pipes. Rather, for pipes the "depth" parameters are half of the angle subtended by the wetted peri­meter, in radians, as shown in Figure V-6. Knowledge of this fact aids in understanding the Fortran coding in subroutine GUTTER.**
>
> **Since a gutter/pipe acts as a reservoir with a water surface parallel to the invert, inflows are automatically "distributed" along its length. Hence, concentration of subcatchment inflows only at the upstream end of a gutter/pipe may be reasonable. On the other hand, this leads to consider­able dispersion or flattening of a hydrograph peak when it is routed through a cascade of gutter/pipes. Of course, for this flow routing scheme, down­stream changes are not "felt" upstream, and no backwater effects can be simulated.**
>
> **Non-convergence messages are encountered more frequently during gutter/ pipe routing than for subcatchment flow routing, due to the tendency to in­clude short gutter/pipes of small dimensions in the simulation. Again, this can usually be cured by increasing the dimensions (e.g., length and width/ diameter) or decreasing the time step.**

APPENDIX VI

TRANSPORT BLOCK SCOUR AND DEPOSITION

INTRODUCTION

Deposition of solid material during dry-weather flow (DWF) in combined sewers and subsequent scour during wet-weather flow has long been assumed to form a significant contribution of solids to combined sewer overflows. The deposition-scour phenomenon is also evident in the "first flush" -- high solids concentrations at the beginning of a storm event -- found in many sewer systems. Even storm sewer systems may show a first flush if there is a base flow due to infiltration or illegal connections.

Deposition and scour processes were included in the original SWMM Transport Block as described in the documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a). It simulated solids buildup during DWDAYS dry days prior to the storm and scour during the storm, as velocities increased. A constant horizontal approximation to the dimensionless shear stress on Shields' curve (described subsequently) was used to determine incipient motion, and one fixed particle size distribution (for suspended solids only) and specific gravity of 2.7 were used to characterize the solids.

Several problems existed in the routine, perhaps unknown to most SWMM users. The deposition-scour was dependent on the time step.

Buildup of solids would occur using a 1-hr time step for the dry days prior to simulation, but scour would occur using, say, a 10-min simu­lation time step with the same flow conditions. The particle size distribution was unaffected by the amount scoured from the bottom or deposited from the flow. Thus, there was no simulation of large particles being deposited in upstream conduits (and thereby unavailable for deposi­tion further downstream). It was not possible to calibrate the routine or even "turn it off" since all constants were incorporated into the program and were not input parameters. Finally, there were situations in which conservation of solids mass was violated. Although the revised routine still represents a gross approximation to the real sediment transport processes at work in sewer systems, it is at least consistent within itself, it conserves mass, and is both calibratable and avoidable.

There have been other recent investigations of solids deposition in sewers, most notably the work of Sonnen (1977) and Pisano et al. (1979). Sonnen's work is highly relevant to the modeling aspect since he developed

> 459 VI-1

a deposition-scour routine to accompany the Extran Block of SWMM. This model simulated both bed load and suspended load sediment transport and characterized the sediment by up to ten particle size-specific gravity ranges. Although his routines worked satisfactorily, they are not compatible with the "old" Transport Block, and the "new" Extran Block no longer routes quality parameters. In addition, they are perhaps overly sophisticated for the present needs. Thus, the current programming utilizes an approximate method that is not as sound as Sonnen's but does have the attributes described earlier.

The best characterization of solids in real sewer systems is given by Pisano et al. (1979) in their description of extensive field and analytical work done in the Boston area. The many problems inherent in dealing with real systems are amply demonstrated.

METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS  
<u>Overview</u>

> Since the criterion for deposition and scour depends upon the sediment

characteristics (notably size and specific gravity), one option for

simulation of the range of characteristics found in real sewer sediment

is to carry along a group of different sizes and specific gravities and

route each range individually. This is done in the Storage/Treatment

Block of SWMM and was done by Sonnen (1977). This has the disadvantage

of requiring large array sizes since each range must be simulated for

each conduit and preferably for each pollutant.

As an alternative, the present methodology utilizes a fixed particle size distribution and specific gravity (input by the user) for each desired pollutant and maintains a time history for each conduit of the <u>maximum</u> particle diameter (DS) in <u>suspension</u> (really, in <u>motion</u> -- via bed or suspended load) and the <u>minimum</u> particle diameter (DB) in the bed. Thus, the particle size distribution of particles in motion is the input distribution truncated on the right at DS, and the particle size distribution of deposited solids is the input distribution truncated on the left at DB. Mass-weighted values of DS are routed downstream for entry to subsequent conduits.

<u>Assumptions</u>

Several assumptions are inherent in the following development, including the following:

1\. Solids in sewer systems are<sub>.</sub>assumed to behave like ideal non-cohesive sediment described in various texts (e.g., Graf, 1971, Vanoni, 1975). Unfortunately, the work of Pisano et al. (1979) shows little evidence of this, and in fact, it may be an impossible task to provide an accurate theoretical description of transport of the highly hetero­geneous material constituting "solids" in real sewer systems. The only hope is that the theory will appear to behave in a "reasonable" manner.

2.  No distinction is made between particle size distributions resulting from different pollutant sources, e.g., dry-weather flow and storms water. Only one distribution (and one average specific gravity) is used for each pollutant.

3.  Shields' criterion is used to determine the dividing particle size between motion and no motion.

4.  Once in motion, no distinction is made between bed and suspended load. Particles in motion ("suspension") are routed downstream in each conduit by complete mixing, the same as other quality parameters.

5.  When a critical diameter (CRITD) is determined for scour, all particles with diameter less than or equal to CRITD are eroded. There is no effect simulated of armoring or of erosion of layers of the bed.

6.  Scour-deposition is considered <u>only</u> in conduits. It is not simulated in non-conduits, including storage elements.

7.  The effect of deposited sediment on the bed geometry is not considered. When the hydraulic radius (an important parameter) is calculated to determine the critical diameter for motion, the bed is assumed to have the geometry of the conduit. This leads to some under­estimation of deposited material, mainly at low flows.

> SHIELDS' CRITERION
>
> Shields' diagram for the definition of incipient motion is shown in Figure VI-1. It is widely accepted as a good definition of the beginning of particle motion and describes the balance between the hydrodynamic forces of drag and lift on a particle (tending to induce motion) and the submerged weight of a particle (tending to resist motion). When hydro­dynamic forces acting on a sediment particle reach a value such that if increased even slightly will put the particle into motion, critical or threshold conditions are said to have been reached. Dimensional analysis of this condition leads to

Near critical conditions, observations of a large area of the sediment bed will show that the incidence of sediment motion occurs as gusts and is random in both time and space. Shields and others observed the process of initiation of motion to be stochastic in nature, so that there *is* no true "critical condition" at which motion suddenly begins. In fact, data on critical shear stress are based upon arbitrary definitions of critical conditions by several investigators. Shields himself determined T<sub>c</sub> as the value for zero sediment discharge obtained by extrapolation on a graph of observed sediment discharge versus shear stress.

Equation VI-9 works well for the coefficients a and b of equation VI-6. But for equation VI-4, b = -1 and the exponent approaches infinity. For the region R<sub>\*</sub> \< 1.47, all sediment particles are within the laminar sublayer of the flow, and motion is independent of the diameter (Graf, 1971). For practical purposes, there is no apparent motion, and the critical diameter is assumed to be the value at R<sub>\*</sub> = 1.47 in the model,

that is d <u>1.47-</u>

> The polynomial for the transition region, 1.47 \< R<sub>\*</sub> \< 10, is

rapidly solved using a Newton-Raphson iteration. In the program, equation VI-9 is first solved using the a and b values for equation VI-6 (10 \< R<sub>\*</sub> \< 400). If the resulting value of R<sub>\*</sub> is greater than 400, the critical diameter is evaluated from equation VI-7. If R<sub>\*</sub> is less 10, the polynomial approximation is then solved. If the resulting value of R<sub>\*</sub> from polyno­mial is greater than 10, the critical diameter is assumed to be the value at R<sub>\*</sub> = 10, and if R<sub>\*</sub> is less than 1.47, the value at R<sub>\*</sub>= 1.47 is used as a default.

Regarding the parameters of equation VI-9, the slope, S is taken as the invert slope (SLOPE) for each conduit, used by the Transport Block. The hydraulic radius is calculated at each time step, and the kinematic viscosity, v, (GNU) is input for each run. (It incorporates any tempera­ture effects.), The specific gravity (SPG) of sewer particles ranges from 1.1 for organic material to 2.7 for sand and grit. An average value, based upon the rough composition of the sediment, must be used. When quality parameters are input in card group Fl of the Transport Block, if SPG \< 1.0, the deposition-scour routine will not be used. It may be seen that if SPG is greater than 1.0 but very close to it, the value of CRITD in equation VI-9 becomes highly sensitive to it.

PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION

The particle size distribution for each pollutant for which it is desired to simulate deposition and scour is input by up to four straight line segments, as shown in Figure VI-3 (see also Figure 6-6). The distribution may be based upon characteristics of surface sediment for simulation of storm sewers, but should utilize sewer conduit samples for combined sewers.

An example will best illustrate the use of the particle size distri­bution. Consider first an example of scour. The distribution of Figure VI-3 is sketched again in Figure VI-4a. At the beginning of the time step, all particles in the bed are assumed to have diameters \> DB = 0.6 mm in the example. If a new critical diameter, CRITD, is calculated that is greater than DB, (CRITD = 1.5 mm in the example), the new bed distribution will become as shown in Figure VI-4b. The percent of the bed mass that is scoured is

INFLOWS AND JUNCTIONS

To allow some difference between surface inflows to the sewer system and dry-weather flow inflows (e.g., domestic sewage) a maximum particle size, PSDWF, may be specified (in card group Fl) for the pollutant found in DWF. This also applies to pollutants entering as a base flow in manholes. Pollutants entering via infiltration are assumed to be completely dissolved and have "zero particle sizes."

At junctions (manholes or other non-conduits), a new value of DS

is computed by mass weighting the merging values. For instance,

APPENDIX VII

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS OF URBAN RUNOFF  
QUALITY DATA FOR MODELING APPLICATIONS

Options for simulation of surface runoff quality in SWMM have been described in Section 4 of this report. They are basically two: use of a buildup-washoff equation or use of a rating curve. The former (equation 4-35) results in a characteristic loop effect when intra-storm loads are plotted versus runoff rate (Figure 4-36) while the latter must result in a single valued function. In this appendix, data from three separate sewered catchments in Seattle and one combined sewered catchment in Lancaster, PA are examined in order to see if SWMM has the ability to mimic their load and concentration versus flow characteristics. The data were taken from the EPA Urban Rainfall-Runoff-Quality Data Base (Huber et al., 1979) and analyzed using library statistical packages.

> Three parameters were chosen for analysis:

1)  Five day biochemical oxygen demand, BOD<sub>5,</sub>

2)  Total suspended solids, TSS, and

3)  N0<sub>2</sub>+N0<sub>3</sub>-N for Seattle and N0<sub>3</sub>-N for Lancaster.

The first parameter, BOD, is likely to be associated with solids, the second parameter is a solid, and the nitrogen parameters are likely to be dissolved. Hence, they may exhibit different characteristic relation­ships.

Results are presented in the following figures. (See also Figure 4-37.) Loops are evident in the Lancaster data (Figures VII-17 to VII-19) although eratic, since the runoff hydrographs are eratic. Loops are also present for the Seattle data although harder to detect since suces-sive points are not connected (Figures VII-4 to VII-6). As expected, nitrate concentrations decrease with increasing flow rate (Figures VII-16 and VII-20). Log-log plots tend to reduce the magnitude of the loops and could form the basis of a rating curve approximation. When loads for the three Seattle catchments are normalized by dividing by their respective catchment areas the data are grouped with less scatter (Figure VII-12) than when not normalized (Figure VII-11). The runoff rate in inches/hr is already a normalized flow rate for these catchments.

APPENDIX VIII

MISCELLANEOUS TRANSPORT BLOCK TABLES

The following tables provide guidelines for input into the infil­tration (subroutine INFIL) and dry-weather flow (subroutine FILTH)

routines of the Transport Block. Table gives average degree-days  
(cumulative deviation below 65<sup>°</sup>F, summed for the days of each month) for several U.S. cities. Current values are also tabulated in various summary forms by the National Weather Service.

Tables VIII-2 and VIII-3 provide guidelines for relative water use by various commercial establishments and industries. These may be entered as process flows in card groups P1 and Ql, for instance.

> **Quality routing in the Transport and Runoff Blocks through conduit segments has long been accomplished by assuming complete mixing within the conduit in the manner of a continuously stirred tank reactor or "CSTR." The procedure is described in the original SWMM documentation (Metcalf and Eddy et al., 1971a, Appendix B) and was very similar to the complete mixing formulation of the Storage/Treatment Block. See, for example, the discussion of equations IV-9, IV-10 and IV-11 in Appendix IV. For the finite difference scheme of equation IV-11, however, it may easily be shown that negative concentrations may be predicted if**

> **V = average volume in the conduit or storage unit, ft<sup>3</sup>, and  
> Q = average flow through the conduit or storage unit, cfs.**
>
> **This rarely causes a problem for storage unit simulation due to their large volumes. But when long time steps (e.g., 1 hr) are used in Runoff or Transport, instabilities in the predicted concentrations may arise.**
>
> **These may readily be avoided with minimal loss of accuracy by using the integrated form of the solution to the differential equation. The procedure is described by Medina et al. (1981) and is outlined below as applied to the Runoff and Transport Blocks.**

> **An analytical solution of this equation is seldom possible when Q, Q<sub>i</sub>, C V and L vary arbitrarily with time, as in the usual routing through conduits. However, a simple solution is available to the ordinary, first order differential equation with <u>constant</u> coefficients if parameters Q, Q , C<sub>i</sub> , V, L and dV/dt are assumed to be <u>constant</u> over the solution time interval, t to t + At. In practice, average values over the time interval are used at each time step. Equation IX-2 is then readily integrated over the time interval t to t + At with**

> **where DENOM = Q/V + K + dV/dt (IX-5)  
> Thus, the concentration at the end of the time step is predicted as the sum of a weighted inflow concentration and a decaying concentration from the previous time step.**
>
> **Equation IX-4 is used in both the Runoff and Transport Block and is completely stable with respect to changes in At. It does not reflect rapid changes in volume and flow as well as the finite difference solution (e.g., equation IV-11) but it is updated at each time step. Given the many other uncertainties of quality routing within the sewer system, it should** *be* **adequate.**
