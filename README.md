 Here is a list of some common features that you might find in stormwater modeling software:

# Network representation: The ability to create a detailed representation of the stormwater network, including pipes, channels, inlets, and outfalls.

# Hydrology: Tools for calculating stormwater runoff and infiltration, as well as modeling the effects of rain events and other precipitation.

# Hydraulics: Tools for simulating the flow of stormwater through the network, including flow rates, water levels, and pressure.

# Water quality: Tools for analyzing the water quality of stormwater runoff, including the concentrations of various pollutants and contaminants.

# Flood mapping: The ability to create maps that show flood risk and potential impacts on different areas.

# Scenario modeling: The ability to create and compare multiple scenarios to see how different conditions or changes to the network might affect the results.

# Output visualization: Tools for visualizing the results of a simulation, such as graphs, maps, and tables.

# Data management: The ability to import, export, and manipulate data, including GIS data and other types of input data.
